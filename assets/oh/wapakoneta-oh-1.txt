ADOPTING ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE 93-48
AN ORDINANCE APPROVING, ADOPTING AND ENACTING THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF
WAPAKONETA, OHIO, 1993; REPEALING ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS IN CONFLICT
THEREWITH; PUBLISHING THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Wapakoneta, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of City legislation before it for some time;
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Wapakoneta,
Ohio, to-wit:
   SECTION ONE
   That the ordinances and resolutions of the City of Wapakoneta, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, arranged, compiled, numbered,
codified and printed in component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are
hereby approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Wapakoneta,
Ohio, 1993.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of
Wapakoneta, Ohio.
   SECTION TWO
   That all ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof that are in conflict or
inconsistent with any provision of the 1993 Codified Ordinances are hereby
repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the 1993 Codified Ordinances shall not be construed
to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way;

thereof, are or contain new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
   SECTION FOUR
   That pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, the Clerk of Council shall cause to be
published, in the manner provided by law, a notice of the enactment of this
ordinance, containing the title of this ordinance, and a summary of the new
matter covered by it, which summary is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
   SECTION FIVE
   That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the inhabitants of the City, and for the further reason that
there is an immediate necessity to have an up-to-date codification of the
legislation of the City, consistent with State law, where and as required by
Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, with which to administer
the affairs of the City, enforce law and order and avoid practical and legal
entanglements, and this ordinance shall, therefore, take effect and be enforced
immediately from and after the date of its passage and approval.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE

ordinances and resolutions enacted by Council or new matter ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance. Sections and subsections of the 1993 Codified Ordinances
without a history or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are
new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance, i.e. the ordinance that

202.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES. 
   (a)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words were
clearly intended to express such intention, such spelling shall be corrected
and such word or words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform to the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No such
alteration shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the
nature or extent of such error.
202.08 REPEAL OF PREVIOUS LEGISLATION.

inconsistent therewith, shall remain in effect and are hereby saved.
202.11 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   If any provision of a code, chapter or section of these Codified Ordinances
conflicts with or contravenes another provision, that provision bearing the
latest passage date shall prevail. If conflicting provisions bear the same
passage date, the conflict shall be construed so as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
202.12 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.

of the City.
   Seal: The seal shall consist of two concentric circles, with the words "City
of Wapakoneta, Ohio" at the top and the year "1833" at the bottom, displayed
between the circles. The year 1833 is the year during which Wapakoneta arose
from the wilderness and was officially founded by our forefathers. Inside the
center circle, a panoramic view of the City and countryside shall have a
background of the sun, rising toward the heavens. The silhouette of the City
shall exemplify the downtown business district, the Auglaize County Courthouse
and a church steeple. A river angles across the foreground of the scene with
three large trees lining the bank on the left. The right side of the scene
displays a field of thriving corn. The lower center of the scene shows neatly
prepared sheathes of wheat. The full scene clearly demonstrates the beauty,
honor and respect that exists between church, state, business and nature in
Wapakoneta.

212.01 BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the Municipality, its employees and customers from data loss and
identity theft is of significant concern to the Municipality and can be reduced
only through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor.
(Res. 2009-22R. Passed 6-1-09.)
212.02 PURPOSE.
   The Municipality adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect
employees, customers, contractors and the Municipality from damages related to
the loss or misuse of sensitive information.
   (a)   This policy will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the Municipality in compliance with State and Federal law
regarding identity theft protection.
   (b)   This policy enables the Municipality to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the
Municipality from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the
Municipality:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
(Res. 2009-22R. Passed 6-1-09.)
212.03 SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the Municipality,
including all personnel affiliated with third parties.
(Res. 2009-22R. Passed 6-1-09.)
212.04 POLICY.
   (a)   Sensitive Information Policy.
      (1)   Definition of “sensitive information” includes the following items

         F.   Other personal information belonging to any customer, employee or
contractor, examples of which include:
            1.   Date of birth;
            2.   Address;
            3.   Phone numbers;
            4.   Maiden name;
            5.   Names; or
            6.   Customer or account number; and
         G.   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment
in securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public Records Act and the
Municipality's open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the
sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he or she should contact
their supervisor.
   (b)   Hard Copy Distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the Municipality will comply with the following policies:
      (1)   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked

record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
      (3)   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
      (4)   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common
shared work areas will be erased, removed, or shredded when not in use.
      (5)   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded they

   (c)   Electronic Distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the Municipality will comply with the following policies:
      (1)   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved
Municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an
electronic format.
      (2)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail:
      "This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and
is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use
by others is strictly prohibited."
(Res. 2009-22R. Passed 6-1-09.)
212.05 ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   If the Municipality maintains certain covered accounts pursuant to Federal
legislation, the Municipality may include the additional program details.
   (a)   Covered Accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the Municipality from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red Flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.
         A.   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         B.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         C.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         D.   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in §334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act.
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         A.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         B.   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         C.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with the
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
         D.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
      (3)   Suspicious documents.
         A.   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged;
         B.   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
         C.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
the information provided by the person opening a new covered account or
customer presenting the identification;
         D.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the Municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check; and
         E.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed or reassembled.
      (4)   Suspicious personal identifying information.
         A.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the Municipality. For
example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
            2.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is
listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or
            3.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
         B.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the Municipality. For example, the address on an application is the same as
the address provided on a fraudulent application.
         C.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the Municipality. For example:
            1.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         D.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
         E.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts.
         F.   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
         G.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the Municipality.
         H.   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
      (5)   Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered
account.
         A.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the Municipality receives a request for new, additional, or
replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the
account.
         B.   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud. For example, the customer fails to
make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
         C.   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
            1.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed
payments; or
            2.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
         D.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
         E.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
         F.   The Municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements.
         G.   The Municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or
transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.
         H.   The Municipality receives notice from customers, victims of
identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding
possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the
Municipality.
         I.   The Municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Res. 2009-22R. Passed 6-1-09.)
212.06 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
Municipality from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (b)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the Municipality; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
(Res. 2009-22R. Passed 6-1-09.)
212.07 PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (a)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be reevaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program are
up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
   (b)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (c)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
   (d)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the Municipality and its
customers.
(Res. 2009-22R. Passed 6-1-09.)
212.08 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Involvement of Management.
      (1)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program is the responsibility of the
governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented
and maintained.
      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the
Office Manager.
   (b)   Staff Training.
      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the Municipality or its customers.
      (2)   The Office Manager is responsible for ensuring identity theft
training for all requisite employees and contractors.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
   (c)   Oversight of Service Provider Arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the Municipality to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.

220.01 COMPOSITION.
   The legislative power of the City shall be vested in and exercised by the
City Council, composed of not less than seven members, four of whom shall be
elected by wards and three of whom shall be elected by electors of the City at
large. For the first 20,000 inhabitants in the City, in addition to the
original 5,000, there shall be two additional members of Council, elected by
wards, and for every 15,000 inhabitants thereafter, there shall be one
additional member similarly elected. The total number of members of the Council
shall not exceed seventeen.
(ORC 731.01; 1978 Code § 31.01)
220.02 QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS.
   Members of the Council at large shall have resided in the City, and members
from wards shall have resided in their respective wards, for at least one year
next preceding their election. Each member of the Council shall be an elector
of the City, shall not hold any other public office except that of notary
public or member of the State Militia, and shall not be interested in any
contract with the City. No such member may hold employment with the City. A
member who ceases to possess any of such qualifications, or removes from his or
her ward, if elected from a ward, or from the City, if elected from the City at
large, shall forthwith forfeit his or her office.
(ORC 731.02; 1978 Code § 31.02)
220.03 ELECTION AND TERM OF MEMBERS.

   Within ten days from the commencement of their term, the members of Council
shall elect a President Pro Tempore, a Clerk and such other employees as are

at a regular meeting of the Council, by a two-thirds vote of the members
elected.
(ORC 731.04; 1978 Code § 31.04)
220.05 VACANCIES.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided herein, when the office of a member of
Council becomes vacant, either because a member ceases to hold the office
before the end of his or her term or because a member-elect fails to take
office, the vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term by
a person chosen by the residents of the City who are members of the County
Central Committee of the political party by which the last occupant of that
office or the member-elect was nominated. If the vacancy occurs in the office
of a ward representative in the City where the political party which nominated
the last occupant of that office is organized into a City Controlling Committee
with more than one member from the ward where the vacancy exists, the members
of the City Controlling Committee representing that ward shall choose the
person to fill the vacancy.
   (b)   Not less than five nor more than forty-five days after a vacancy
occurs, the specified members of the City or County Committee shall meet to

the meeting, the Chairperson or Secretary of the City or County Committee shall
notify each Committee member eligible to vote on filling the vacancy, by first
class mail, of the date, time and place of the meeting and its purpose. A
majority of all eligible Committee members constitutes a quorum, and a majority
of the quorum is required to make the appointment. If election to the office so
vacated took place at a nonpartisan election, or if the office was occupied by,
or was to be occupied by, a person not nominated at a primary election, or if
the appointment was not made by the Committee members in accordance with this
section, the vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as a vacancy in the
legislative authority of a village, as provided in Ohio R.C. 731.43.
(ORC 731.43)
220.06 AS JUDGE OF ELECTION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS; QUORUM AND SPECIAL

violation of its rules, and declare his or her seat vacant for absence without

shall take place without the concurrence of two-thirds of all the members

administrative duties nor appoint nor confirm any officer or employee in the
City government except those of its own body, except as otherwise provided by
law. All contracts requiring the authority of Council for their execution shall
be entered into and conducted to performance by the board or officers having
charge of the matters to which they relate. After authority to make such
contracts has been given, and the necessary appropriation made, Council shall
take no further action thereon.
(ORC 731.05; 1978 Code § 31.10)

the application of the accused. The accused may appear in person and by
counsel, examine all witnesses and answer all charges against him or her. The
judgment or action of the Council shall be final, but to remove such officer,
the votes of two-thirds of all members elected to the Council shall be
required.
(ORC 733.36; 1978 Code § 31.14)

220.14 COMPELLING TESTIMONY; COSTS.
   In all cases in which the attendance of witnesses may be compelled for an
investigation, pursuant to Section 220.13, any member of the Council may
administer the requisite oaths, and the Council shall have the same power to
compel the giving of testimony by the attending witnesses as is conferred upon
courts of justice. In all such cases, witnesses shall be entitled to the same
privileges and immunities as are allowed witnesses in civil cases. Witnesses
shall be paid the same fees and mileage provided for under Ohio R.C. 1901.26,
and the costs of all such proceedings shall be payable from the General Fund of
the City.

248.011 EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE BILLING.
   (a)   Definitions. As used in this section and for reimbursement purposes,
the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectfully ascribed
to them as follows:
      (1)   “Basic Life Support (BLS).” Transportation by ground ambulance
vehicle and the provision of medically necessary supplies and services,
including BLS ambulance services as defined by the State. The ambulance must be
staffed by individuals who are qualified in accordance with State and local
laws as an emergency medical technician- basic (EMT-Basic). These laws may vary
from state to state or within a state. For example, only in some jurisdictions
is an EMT-Basic permitted to operate limited equipment onboard the vehicle,
assist more qualified personnel in performing assessments and interventions,
and establish a peripheral intravenous (IV) line.
      (2)   “Advanced Life Support, level 1 (ALS1).” The transportation by
ground ambulance vehicle and the provision of medically necessary supplies and
services, including the provision of an ALS assessment or at least one ALS
intervention. An advanced life support (ALS) assessment is an assessment
performed by an ALS crew as part of an emergency response that was necessary
because the patient's reported condition at the time of dispatch was such that
only an ALS crew was qualified to perform the assessment. An ALS assessment
does not necessarily result in a determination that the patient requires an ALS
level of service. An advanced life support (ALS) intervention is a procedure
that is in accordance with State and local laws, required to be done by an
emergency medical technician-intermediate (EMT-Intermediate) or EMT-Paramedic.
      (3)   “Advanced Life Support, Level 2 (ALS2). The transportation by
ground ambulance vehicle and the provision of medically necessary supplies and
services including: (1) at least three separate administrations of one or more
medications by intravenous push/bolus or by continuous infusion (excluding
crystalloid fluids); or (2) ground ambulance transport, medically necessary
supplies and services, and the provision of at least one of the ALS2 procedures
listed below:
         A.   Manual defibrillation/cardioversion;
         B.   Endotracheal intubation;
         C.   Central venous line;
         D.   Cardiac pacing;
         E.   Chest decompression;
         F.   Surgical airway; or
         G.   Intraosseous line.
      (4)   “Transport.” To carry or convey a person by a publicly owned and/or
operated motor vehicle being used in response to a call for emergency medical
assistance from one location to another.
      (5)   “Fees for Service.” The fee associated with the emergency
transportation of each individual requiring either basic life support or
advanced life support shall be the usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) charge
established by insurance companies within the region.
   (b)   Payment of Fee.
      (1)   No person shall be charged for basic life support or advanced life
support treatment unless he or she is transported by the City's Emergency
Medical Service.
      (2)   Every person being transported by the Emergency Medical Service or
some other person on behalf of that person being transported shall complete and
execute an assignment of benefits form at the time of such Emergency Medical
Service transport.
      (3)   If either the person being transported or some other person on
behalf of that person being transported, when, for any reason, the person being
transported is unable to execute an assignment of benefits form which entitles
the City to recover its Emergency Medical Service transportation fee directly
from the appropriate public or private insurer or any Federal, State or County
public welfare agency which may be responsible for paying the costs of treated
person's emergency transportation, the person being transported shall not be
held liable for all or any part of the fee forth above.
         A.   If the person being transported or some other person on behalf of
that person being transported provides incomplete, false or misleading
information which prevents the City from recovering upon its assignment of
benefits, the person being transported shall not be relieved of liability for
the fee set forth above until a complete, truthful and accurate assignment of
benefits form has been prepared, signed and presented to the Finance
Department.
         B.   If in spite of the completion of an assignment of benefits form,
the person being transported receives all or any part of the City's Emergency
Medical Service transportation fee, the person being transported shall not be
relieved of liability for such fee until he or she has remitted to the City all
moneys he or she received for payment of such fee for such Emergency Medical
Service.
      (4)   If the person being transported has no insurance and no other
payment source for the Emergency Medical Service fee exits, or if the
appropriate public or private insurer or Federal, State or County welfare
agency pays less than the full Emergency Medical Service fee, the balance still
due and owing for transportation of that person shall be waived by the City as
payment in full unless this provision violates any State or Federal law as it
pertains to the collection of fees.
   (c)   Establishment of Rates. It is hereby authorized and approved that the
third party administrator selected by the City shall establish the fee
submitted to the insurance carrier, determinate upon the level of the service
provided to the individual(s) being transported.

260.07 POSITION CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   (a)   The position classification plan provides for the classification of
each employment position in the City, so that personnel problems may be dealt
with as systematically and equitably as possible, and so that the principle of
"equal pay for equal work" may be observed.
   (b)   The plan shall be used:
      (1)   As an aid in the determination of lines of promotion;
      (2)   In defining payroll items in several departments and fund budgets;
and
      (3)   In determining salaries for various types of work.
   (c)   Development of the position classification plan is as follows: The
Director of Public Service and Safety shall be responsible for the proper and
continuous maintenance of the classification plan so that it will reflect on a
current basis the duties being performed by each employee of the City and the
class to which each position is allocated. Revisions of the class
specifications and reallocations within the classification plan shall be as
follows:
      (1)   The Director of Public Service and Safety shall study the duties
and responsibilities of each new position as it is created and, on the basis of
that study, place the position in the appropriate class within the
classification plan.
      (2)   Changes in the duties or responsibilities of any position involving
either the addition of new assignments or the taking away or modification of
existing assignments shall be reported to the Director of Public Service and
Safety by the department heads. If these changes are determined to be permanent
or more than minor changes, and justify reallocation to a different
classification, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall place such
position in its appropriate classification. Reallocations involving civil
service shall be reported to the Civil Service Commission by the Director of
Public Service and Safety so that its rules and regulations may be followed as
required.
      (3)   The Director of Public Service and Safety shall periodically review
the classification of positions and, on the basis of such review, may combine,
abolish or, if necessary, upon approval of the City Council, establish new
classifications.
      (4)   The Director of Public Service and Safety, as chief administrative
officer, shall be the appointing authority for all positions in the Department
of Public Service and Safety. The responsibility for the maintenance of a
superior degree of efficiency, discipline and morale is that of the Director of
Public Service and Safety, and the Director may remove from the City service
any employees appointed by him or her and shall exercise control and
supervision over all subdepartments and classifications in the Department of
Public Service and Safety. All new employees must complete an employment
application form prior to approval for employment and may be required to submit
to a physical examination by a competent physician designated by the City. The
expense of the examination will be borne by the City.
      (5)   Due to the nature of certain job duties or requirements, an
employee may be requested to live in Auglaize County or an adjacent county. The
employee will be informed of this at the time of employment.
      (6)   An employee may at any time submit a written request, through his
or her department head, to the Director of Public Service and Safety for a
review of the allocation of his or her position, setting forth the reasons for
justifying the review. The Director of Public Service and Safety shall make, or
cause to be made, an investigation of the position, with a view to determining
its correct allocation. The decision of the Director of Public Service and
Safety shall be reported to the employee.

Passed 1-6-25.)
260.08 COMPENSATION.
   The salary to be paid to all City employees shall be as established by
Council.
(Ord. 2003-26. Passed 5-5-03; Ord. 2006-31. Passed 7-17-06; Ord. 2007-26.
Passed 7-2-07; Ord. 2012-32. Passed 6-18-12; Ord. 2012-40. Passed 9-5-12; Ord.

4-17-17.)
260.09 SALARIES NOT TO BE CHANGED DURING TERM; DEPOSIT OF FEES.
   The salary of any officer shall not be increased or diminished during the
term for which he or she was elected or appointed, and, except as otherwise
provided in these Codified Ordinances, all fees pertaining to any office shall
be paid into the City Treasury. This section does not prohibit the payment of
any increased costs of continuing to provide the identical benefits provided to
an officer at the commencement of his or her term of office.
(ORC 731.07) (Ord. 2003-26. Passed 5-5-03; Ord. 2006-31. Passed 7-17-06.)
260.10 PAY PLAN.
   (a)   The minimum rate of pay for a class shall be paid upon appointment to
the class, except that appointment rates above the minimum rate may be paid by
the Director of Public Service and Safety. The department head may submit a
request, outlining reasons for such action, for approval by the Director of
Public Service and Safety. Justification for approval will be limited to
recognition of exceptional qualifications or experience of an eligible
employee, or lack of available eligible employees at the minimum rate. If a
former employee is re-employed in a class in which he or she has previously
been employed, the Director of Public Service and Safety may make an
appointment at the same rate of pay which the employee had been receiving at
the termination of his or her service if that rate is at or above the
established minimum rate at the time of re-employment.
   (b)   Increases within appropriate ranges shall be from one step to the next
higher step. Except for the position of Director of Public Service and Safety,
the employee must have completed six months at the lower pay range when
advancing from Step 1 to Step 2. Except for the position of Director of Public
Service and Safety, the employee must have completed one year at the lower pay
range before advancing from Step 2 to Step 3, from Step 3 to Step 4, and from
Step 4 to Step 5. However, if it is determined that an employee is improperly
classified, or in the case of a promotion, the provision that an employee must
have completed not less than twelve months at the next lower pay range may be
waived by the Director of Public Service and Safety. If an employee, other than
the Director of Public Service and Safety, starts in a step other than Step 1,
he or she is eligible to advance to the next step in six months.
   The Director of Public Service and Safety shall advance to the next step on
January 1 of each year subsequent to the date of his or her appointment.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, salary
increases of more than one step or more frequently than specified may be made
by the Director of Public Service and Safety on recommendation from the
department head, in exceptional circumstances.
   (d)   Each step of the five-step salary and hourly range shall not be
considered automatic. The department head must justify to the Director of
Public Service and Safety and the employee the denial or approval of an
increase on the basis of the employee's job performance.
      (1)   Each new employee shall be regarded as probationary for a period of
six months. After such probationary period, the employee is advanced to the
next step or is not retained as an employee.
      (2)   The employee is expected to constantly develop his or her ability.
Improvement may be attained by greater skill in performing assigned tasks,
increased work effort and satisfactory completion of work relating to the
position.
   (e)   Employees appointed to City positions may be assigned to any step
within the approved range as deemed appropriate by the Director of Public
Service and Safety. After a probationary period of six months, the employee may
be advanced to the next higher step. Advancement through these steps shall not
be considered automatic and will be made on the basis of positive employee
performance.
   (f)   Each year the Director of Public Service and Safety shall meet with
the heads of the various departments and shall compile a personnel evaluation
and review of the department heads. The Director then shall make
recommendations to City Council as to salary increases and/or benefit
adjustments which should be made in the pay plan. Personnel evaluations shall
generally take place during the fourth quarter of each year such that
adjustments to wages and benefits can be considered and made effective during
the proceeding January of the next calendar year.

260.11 DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF SALARY AND HOURLY RANGES.
   (a)   Salary and hourly ranges shall be linked directly to the plan of
position classification and shall be determined with due regard to ranges of
pay for other classes, relative difficulty and responsibility of positions in
the class, availability of employees in particular occupational categories, and
other related considerations. The minimum, maximum and intermediate steps of
each range shall be those rates in the standard salary and hourly schedule
which most nearly reflect these factors.
   (b)   Annually, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall meet and
confer with the Finance Committee of City Council for the purpose of reviewing
and recommending, with the Mayor, changes in this section to the City Council.

260.12 TOTAL REMUNERATION.
   (a)   The salary rate, plus reimbursement for automobile expense, uniforms,
official travel and any special provisions outlined in this pay plan, shall be
the total remuneration of the employee. Except as herein provided, no employee
shall receive pay from the City in addition to that authorized under the
schedule provided in the pay plan for services rendered by him or her in the
discharge of his or her duties or of any additional duties which may be imposed
upon him or her or which he or she may undertake or volunteer to perform.
   (b)   City services are not to be extended by employees in exchange for
special rewards, gifts or other remuneration from outside individuals or
organizations.
(Ord. 2003-26. Passed 5-5-03; Ord. 2006-31. Passed 7-17-06.)
260.13 PART-TIME WORK.
   Whenever a part-time employee works for a period less than the regularly
established number of hours a day, days a week, or weeks a month, the amount
paid shall be in proportion to the time actually employed for this class,
unless special circumstances require revisions of the rate. Such revision shall
be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Service and Safety or the
responsible City official.
(Ord. 2003-26. Passed 5-5-03; Ord. 2006-31. Passed 7-17-06.)

scheduled by the department head, and prior approval must be secured from the
Director of Public Service and Safety.
      (2)   In cases of true emergency, overtime work and overtime pay shall be
authorized by the department head or such authorization is to be made under
general guidelines specified in advance by the Director, and the department
head is responsible to the Director for its judicious use.
   (b)   Budgeted funds must be available for payment of overtime work.
      (1)   Full-time employees will be compensated for approved scheduled and
approved emergency overtime beyond regular shift hours in any one day and the
established work week, at one and one-half times the average hourly rate. Sick
leave benefits will not be considered as regular shift hours, unless the hours
are used for a pre-planned appointment and an accompanying form is submitted.
      (2)   Employees may be given compensatory time off in lieu of cash as
payment for overtime. However, one and one-half hours of compensatory time must
be given for each hour of overtime worked.
      (3)   When employees attend mandatory training courses and/or meetings
approved in writing by the Director of Public Service and Safety, while not on
regular duty for the City of Wapakoneta, the employee shall be compensated at
his or her overtime rate of pay, if the time qualifies as overtime as described
in this section.
   (c)   When an employee is transferred at the City's request to a
classification other than his or her regular job duties, he or she shall
receive the higher of his or her regular pay or the pay for the job
classification to which he or she is transferred.
   Any employee requesting a transfer to another job classification which meets
with the approval of the Director of Public Service and Safety shall receive

260.18 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Each full-time employee shall be entitled to 4.6 hours of sick leave
with pay for each completed eighty hours of service. Seasonal and part-time
employees shall not be eligible for sick leave benefits.
   (b)   Unused sick leave shall be cumulative without limit. When sick leave
is used, it shall be deducted from the employee's credit on the basis of one
hour for every one hour of absence from previously scheduled work.
   (c)   Sick leave may be granted only for absence from duty because of
personal illness, legal quarantine, injury off or on the job and death or
serious illness in the employee's or the employee's spouse's immediate family.
Immediate family shall be construed as being a husband, wife, father, mother,
sister, brother, son, daughter, grandparent, grandchild and other persons at
the discretion of the Director of Public Service and Safety.
   (d)   When an employee is unable to report for work for reasons set forth in
subsection (c) hereof, he or she shall, if possible, notify his or her
supervisor prior to the regular reporting time of his or her inability to
report for work. Failure to comply with this request shall be grounds for
disciplinary action.
   (e)   Each employee shall submit a satisfactory written, signed statement to
justify the use of sick leave. If medical attention is required, a certificate
stating the nature of the illness from a licensed physician shall be required.
Falsification of either a written signed statement or a physician's certificate
shall be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. The
Director of Public Service and Safety may order any employee claiming an
illness or injury rendering him or her unable to perform his or her duties to
submit to an examination by a designated physician at the City's expense.
   (f)   While absent from work due to illness or injury an employee must
remain at home caring for his or her illness or injury or at a place receiving
medical attention (hospital, doctor's office, clinic, etc.) and be able to
document any absence from home. An authorized City representative may
investigate any absence from duty as a result of a claimed illness or injury.
   (g)   No sick leave benefits shall be paid for convalescence outside of
Auglaize County without prior written approval of the Director of Public
Service and Safety, unless the employee is a patient in a hospital or other
institution.
   (h)   Previously accumulated sick leave of an employee who has been
separated from the public service shall be placed to his or her credit upon his
or her re-employment in the public service, provided that re-employment takes
place within ten years of the date on which the employee was last terminated
from public service. An employee who transfers from another public agency to
this agency shall be credited with the unused balance of his or her accumulated
sick leave.
   (i)   A City employee hired prior to January 1, 1988, shall, at the time of
retirement from active service with the City, be paid one-half of the value of
his or her earned but unused sick leave credit. A City employee hired after
January 1, 1988, at the time of retirement from active service with the City,
shall be paid twenty-five percent of his or her accrued but unused sick leave,
up to a maximum of 260 accrued sick days (sixty-five days total maximum
payment). Payment of accrued but unused sick leave under an applicable
collective bargaining agreement shall supersede this policy. In either case, to
qualify for such payment, the employee shall have had, prior to the date of
retirement, ten or more years of service with the City, County, State or any of
its political subdivisions. Such payment shall be based on the employee's rate
of pay at the time of retirement. Such payment shall be made only once and
shall eliminate all sick leave credit accrued by the employee. An employee who
dies shall be eligible for such sick leave payment for which he or she would
otherwise have qualified effective as of the date of his or her death. Such
payment shall be made in accordance with Ohio R.C. 2113.04 or be paid to the
employee's estate.
   (j)   Sick leave benefits will not be paid without the completion of forms
provided by the City for sick leave benefits, which completed forms must have
proper signatures affixed thereto.
   (k)   Sick leave donation.
   Employees may receive and donate on a strictly voluntary basis accrued sick
leave hours from/to other employees of the City per the conditions of receipt
and donation identified herein.
   Hours are donated and received on an hour for hour basis and shall be paid
at the current rate of pay of the employee using the hours. All hours donated
but not used shall be returned to the original donor.
   Sick leave may be donated to employees for usage that qualifies for sick
leave use. In order to receive donated sick leave, the employee receiving the
hours must have exhausted all paid sick leave.
   Employees may donate sick leave hours in minimum blocks of one hour. While
an employee may donate to multiple employees eligible for donation, an employee
may donate a maximum of 40 hours to any one person per year.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right- of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane- use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not

the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation

(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them;
         B.   Subsequent to being arrested for operating the vehicle as
described in division (a)(2)A. of this section, being asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C.
4511.191 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and being advised
by the officer in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.192 or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance of the consequences of the person’s refusal or
submission to the test or tests, refuse to submit to the test or tests.
   (b)   Underage Alcohol Consumption. No person under 21 years of age shall
operate any vehicle within this Municipality if, at the time of the operation,
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02% but less than
0.08% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person's whole blood;
      (2)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.03% but less than
0.096% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person's blood serum or
plasma.
      (3)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02 grams but less than
0.08 grams by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath;
      (4)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.028 grams but less
than 0.11 grams by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's urine.
   (c)   Prosecution; Limitation on Convictions. In any proceeding arising out
of one incident, a person may be charged with a violation of division (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician- intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance.
      (3)    The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a)
or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol , a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C.
4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-
state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person and
immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to appear
on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the person's
license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer shall order
the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs the
officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency
immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in which the
person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or permit, the
court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial appearance and any
action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension Effective Immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial Appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division(o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.
(ORC 4511.191(D))
   (h)   Penalty for Driving Under the Influence. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provisions of divisions (a)(1)A. through (a)
(1) I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle
while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The

under this section unless the court is presented with current proof of
financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the

division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of the Municipality
except those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the
vehicle or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the Municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified in Section
440.02 or exceeding a gross weight of five tons, upon any street in the
Municipality other than State routes, and County roads, except those local
streets designated as truck routes in Section
440.015 and marked as such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such
operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual
place of storage of such vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or
act other than passage through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so
deviating from either a State route or a designated truck route within the
Municipality shall confine such deviation to that required in order to
accomplish the purpose of the departure.
(Ord. 93-48. Passed 8-18-93.)
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. 
      (1)   Upon application and for good cause, the Director of Public Service
and Safety may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (2)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon State routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (3)   The Director of Public Service and Safety may grant a permit for a
single or round trip, or for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as
the Director in his or her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of
any construction project. The Director may limit or prescribe terms or
conditions of operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by
designating the route, hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, property, health and
safety. The Director may require the posting of bond or other security
necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (4)   For each such permit, the Director shall charge twenty-five dollars
($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police
Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (5)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to apprise drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (6)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Director shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
division (d) of this section.

vehicle combination if the overload on any axle does not exceed 1,000 pounds,
and if the immediately preceding or following axle, excepting the front axle of
the vehicle combination, is underloaded by the same or a greater amount. For
purposes of this division, two axles on one vehicle, less than eight feet
apart, shall be considered as one axle.
      (2)   Whoever violates any other provision of this section shall be fined

   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into

vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner’s and any lienholder’s
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be

R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief’s records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing
of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.

adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally

under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known

or electric bicycle operator who violates any provisions of this Traffic Code
described in division (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles or

the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of the Ohio
Revised Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a
bicycling skills course approved by the court in addition to or in lieu of any
penalty otherwise prescribed by this Traffic Code or the Ohio Revised Code for
that violation.

606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

(R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was

sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.

offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

R.C. 2923.01;

   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.

defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency

and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.15 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and

specifies that R.C. § 955.11(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the

   (b)   Investigation; Conciliation Conferences.
      (1)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall

issues. The investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days
after the filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when

      (2)   If the Secretary shall determine that there are reasonable grounds
to believe a violation has occurred, he or she shall attempt to conciliate the
matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested
parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.

initial conferences shall be made public by any member of the board or its
staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   Consent Agreement. The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties
shall be reduced to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be
signed by the parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does
not constitute an admission by any parties that the law has been violated. The

cooperation and aid of the Ohio Real Estate Commission, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and any other
person or group regarding any matters before the Board.
   (e)   Dismissal or Further Investigation. If the Secretary determines that
the complaint lacks reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this
chapter, he or she shall so inform the Board and the Board may, in its
discretion, dismiss the complaint or order such further investigation as may be
necessary, provided, however, that the Board shall not dismiss the complaint
without first affording either party an opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   Hearing. If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted the conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or an informal consent agreement, or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he or she shall notify the Board
and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a
violation of this chapter has been committed.
      (1)   The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written statement of
charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of
the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his or her authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing
date as he or she deems necessary in support of his or her position. The
hearing shall be open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the
statement of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two
members of the Board, and the issuance of such summons shall require the
attendance of named persons and the production of relevant documents and
records. The failure to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
      (2)   The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the
Board in person or by a duly authorized representative and may have the
assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony in evidence, and
the right to cross-examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony in
evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep
a full record of the hearing, which record shall be public and open to
inspection by any person. Upon request by any principal party to the
proceeding, the Board shall furnish the party a copy of the hearing record, at
such cost as the Board deems appropriate.

consultation with the Director of Law, in executive session, state its findings
to and call the Director of Law to prepare and issue an order under Board
directive requiring the person complained against to cease and desist from the
unlawful conduct and to take affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose
of this chapter, with notice that if the Board, upon investigation by the
Secretary, determines that the person complained against has not, after fifteen
calendar days following service of the Board's order, complied with the order,
the Board will recertify the matter to the Director of Law for enforcement. The
Director of Law shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in
the name of the Board before a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (h)   Dismissal of Complaint. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the
Board shall determine, upon a preponderance of the evidence of the record, that

specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,

series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is

property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered

for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.

under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair

would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all

act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.

value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

642.09(a)(1) or (b)(1):
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to

misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a

responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under § 698.02(c), (d), (e), and
(f). A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under § 698.02(b) only
upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon offenders
whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate
that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter the offender
from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section , an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand

      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (Editor's note: Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and
revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially identical State law
(Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

her duly authorized agent or employee shall require such additional information

allocated to the City. If the Administrator or his or her duly authorized agent
or employee finds net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reasons
of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he or
she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair

or not.
   (f)   Payments with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due.
However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
890.06; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the

shall be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than
three dollars ($3.00) shall be collected or refunded.
      (3)   Nonresident employees whose tax was fully withheld by their
employer but only work a percentage of time within the corporation limits may
file for a refund of tax withheld for the percentage of time that work was

minimum of 5% of tax withheld by employers for nonresident employees for
administration costs. A refund claim form, which may be obtained from the
Administrator, must be completed and signed by both the employer/department
superintendent and the employee. This refund claim form must be submitted with

shall be refunded.
      (4)   An adjustment made to a tax return by the Department of Taxation,

      (5)   There shall be a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) imposed

additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section

notification by the Tax Administrator, or his or her authorized representative,
to file the items required by this division (h).
(Ord. 2004-52. Passed 12-20-04.)
890.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside,
the tax at the rate of 1% on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each
such employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the
tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have in fact
been withheld. Nothing in this section prohibits an employer from withholding
tax on a basis greater than qualifying wages.
   (b)   The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
The employer shall be liable for late filing penalties and interest. The
dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an employer's liability for
failure to pay the tax due.
   (c)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (d)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax, unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (e)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than four hundred dollars ($400.00) per
month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month
following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator may revoke the approval of quarterly
filing and payments whenever the Tax Administrator has reason to believe that
the conditions for granting such authorization have changed, were judged
incorrectly, were not met, or when it is in the best interest of the
Municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and the
employer must begin to file in accordance with this section.
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer, in collecting such tax,
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his or her employees shall, until the same
is paid to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such
employer. Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to
be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (g)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest and
penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
890.12 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return; List of Employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding,
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year, and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee, including tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. In lieu of submitting
form W-2s, an alternative method of report must be approved by the
Administrator or his or her duly authorized agent or employee. The withholding
tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or Federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (j)   A City employer required to withhold the tax from a City resident for
work done or services performed in another municipality, and who does so
withhold and remit to such other municipality, shall be relieved from the
requirement of withholding the City tax from such City resident, except where
the rate of tax for such other municipality is less than the rate of tax
imposed by this chapter. In such case the employer shall withhold and remit the
difference to the City.
   (k)   Domestic Servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.
(Ord. 2004-52. Passed 12-20-04.)

   (a)   Requirement for Filing.
      (1)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not

890.03 shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity, together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any. Provided, however, if a person's income is
wholly from qualifying wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted

890.06, such person need not file a declaration, or if the tax due is one
hundred dollars ($100.00) or less, the person need not file a declaration.

taxing municipality.
      (2)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as

22.5% of the estimated annual tax and at least a similar amount shall be paid
on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the
beginning of the taxable year.
      (4)   For taxpayers that are not individuals, such declaration of
estimated tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of
at least 22.5% of the estimated annual tax and at least a similar amount shall
be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth months
after the beginning of the taxable year.
      (5)   The mere submission of a declaration estimating a tax liability
shall not constitute filing unless accompanied by the required payment.
      (6)   A penalty, interest, or other similar assessment or charge shall
not be imposed against a taxpayer for the late payment or nonpayment of
estimated tax liability in either of the following circumstances:
         A.   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipal

      (2)   In the event that an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the

Municipality is entitled, a refund of the amount so overpaid may be made, or
the same may be applied toward the declaration of tax due for the ensuing year.
No amounts of less than three dollars ($3.00) will be refunded.
(Ord. 2004-52. Passed 12-20-04.)
890.08 APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

shall give daily accounts to the Administrator.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to enforce payment of

chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to Federal income taxation or in Ohio R.C. Title
LVII, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax
and in Ohio R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Ohio R.C. Title LVII.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural,

Federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         B.   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (c)(1)A. of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         C.   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
Federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce
municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net
operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for

   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which, whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (a)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (b)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
      (2)   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
      (3)   The address on the individual's driver's license;

period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the State's
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.

891.05   COLLECTION AT SOURCE
891.051   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
891.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (b)(1)B. of this section
shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not
later than fifteen days after the last day of each month.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
891.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.

services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than 20 days.

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
891.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,

services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
891.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
891.051.

891.053   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (a)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Ohio R.C.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following;
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that information shall be
indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

   (i)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (a)   "Income" reduced by "exempt income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 net
operating loss carry-forward" equals "municipal taxable income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "net
profit" of the taxpayer.
         A.   "Net profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
891.03(c)(23).
         B.   "Adjusted Federal taxable income" is defined in Section

the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
891.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the

   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (i) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
         C.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
891.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
891.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (i)   (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   “Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax

            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (i)(1)C.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (i)(l)C.1. or 2. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
         D.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
891.051 of this Chapter 891 on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (a) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A.   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         B.   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated-
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         C.   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election
applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business.
The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is in such municipal Corporation.
         D.   Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in divisions
(a)(l), (2), and (3) of this section, all the following apply to a taxpayer
that has made the election described in division (i)(2):
         A.   For the purpose of division (a)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of a tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
situs to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (a)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shalt be situs to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (a)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be situs to that individual's qualifying
reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requesting that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (b) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying emote employee's or owner's gualifying remote work
location is in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
891.051 of this Chapter 891.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
891.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the

the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the

income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than

of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
891.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
891.062 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"

      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
891.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
891.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section
891.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
891.081   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Where a resident of the Municipality is subject to another municipal
income tax in a different municipality, the taxpayer shall not pay a total
municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the
higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who receives
net profits, salaries, wages, bonus payments, commissions or other personal
service compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of
the Municipality, if it be made to appear that the taxpayer has paid a
municipal income tax on the same income taxable in this Chapter 891 to another
municipality, shall be allowed credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter
891 of the amount paid by the taxpayer or on his behalf to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed that tax rate described in this
Chapter 891 on such income earned in such other municipality or municipalities
where such tax is paid.
   (c)   Except as provided in Section
891.081(d), if tax or withholding is paid to a municipal corporation on the
income or wages, and if a second municipal corporation imposes a tax on the
same income or wages after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality, the second municipality shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the second municipality
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (d)   If the tax rate in the second municipality is less than the tax rate
in the first municipality, then the credit described in Section
891.081(c) shall be calculated using the tax rate in effect in the second
municipality.
   (e)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as described in Section
891.06 et seq.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a) As used in this section;
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11- 16-15.)
891.083   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
891.081.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.084   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
891.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
891.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
891.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
891.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.09   ANNUAL RETURN
891.091   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection 891.051(c) when the

individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each

withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
Form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under Ohio
R.C. 5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with

end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on

Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
891.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
891.092, the provision in Section
891.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (i)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
891.051(b)(1)B.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
891.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
891.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement:
      "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal
corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year.
If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation,
if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules."
            The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the municipal
income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th
day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six- month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
   (f)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under divisions (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section, the
tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
about the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or
before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
      (1)   If a tax administrator violates division (f) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
      (2)   Division (f) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (a), (b) and (c) of this section if the tax
administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a
federal extension as required to receive the extension under division(a) and
(b) of this section or failed to file for an extension under division (c) of
this section.

   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
891.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a)(2) for the filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in section
891.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11- 16-15.)
891.096   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

Postal Service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
891.10(a)(4).

(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.133   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
    (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession

accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
891.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
891.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
891.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
891.99 for a violation of Section
891.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax

to particular taxpayers.

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
891.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section,
except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who has requested that the text
of the opinion remain confidential. In no event shall the text of an opinion be
made available until the Tax Administrator has removed all information that
identifies the taxpayer and any other parties involved in the activity or
transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (f) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11- 16-15.)
891.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality.
            Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
891.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
891.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal;
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
891.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
891.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11- 16-15.)
891.20   ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 718.30, the Municipality, pursuant to this
chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt rules to
administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (b)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.21   REIMBURSEMENT OF INCARCERATION FEES.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 753.02, the Municipality is permitted to require
persons convicted of offenses other than minor misdemeanors who are
incarcerated to reimburse the Municipality for the expenses incurred by reason
of such incarceration.
   (b)   The costs of confinement may include, but are not limited to, the
costs of repairing property damaged by the prisoner while confined, a per diem
fee for room and board, medical and dental treatment costs, the fee for a
random drug test assessed under Ohio R.C. 341.26(E) and Ohio R.C. 753.33(E),
and a one-time reception fee for the costs of processing the prisoner into the
facility at the time of the prisoner's initial entry into the facility under
the confinement in question, minus any fees deducted under Ohio R.C. 2929.38.
   (c)   Division (a) of this section shall not apply to offenders that the
court finds to be indigent.
   (d)   Funds that are reimbursed to the Municipality pursuant to this section
shall be paid into the general fund of the Municipality.
   (e)   If the offender does not pay to the Municipality the reimbursement
ordered by the court pursuant to this section, the City Director of Law may
collect the claim or institute and appropriate civil action in the name of the
Municipality in the courts of Auglaize County, Ohio, to recover from the
offender the reimbursement for the expenses of confinement as determined by the
court. If an action is filed, it shall be brought no later than one year after
the person is release from incarceration. If it is deemed in the best interest
of the Municipality, the City Director of Law is authorized to compromise and
settle such claim in an amount less than the total reimbursement due to the
Municipality. If an offender does not comply with the reimbursement
determination for expenses of confinement made by the court, then the offender
is deemed to be acting in bad faith, and wantonly, and in any civil action on
behalf of the Municipality to recover from the offender the reimbursement for
the expenses of his or her confinement, the City Director of Law shall request
an award of attorney fees as part of the cost of the proceedings. The award of
such attorney fees shall be paid into the general fund of the Municipality
treasury.

levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actbns and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
891.19.

this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
891.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 2015-45. Passed 11-16-15.)
891.98   SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.

year 2020 a tax exemption may be granted post-construction with the term and
rate still subject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis.
   (e)   Fee Requirements. All commercial and industrial projects are required
to comply with the State application fee requirements of Ohio R.C. 3735.672(C)

1038.01 CONNECTIONS TO UTILITIES; APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   (a)   No property outside the corporate limits of the City may be connected
to, or receive service from, any of the utilities listed under this Title Four
without prior approval from City Council.
      (1)   The decision to allow properties outside the corporate limits to
connect to, or receive service from, any of the utilities listed under this
Title Four will be on a strictly case-by-case basis with each case being
evaluated for its impact on the existing systems.
   (b)   The requirements of this Title Four and all other applicable and
legally binding local ordinances and codifications shall be followed when a
property has been authorized by the City in order to connect to, or receive
service from, any of the utilities listed under this Title Four.
   (c)   Billing adjustments shall be made as follows:
      (1)   If the customer has been overcharged for utility services because
of a malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, overcharges will be
refunded to the customer for the entire period of inaccurate billing, if that
period is identifiable by the municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing
is not identifiable, overcharges will be calculated based on a time period that
is the shortest of the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the
date of installation of the faulty meter or implementation of the error
resulting in the overcharge (if applicable), or 365 days.
      (2)   If a customer has been undercharged for utility services because of
a malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, undercharges will be
billed to the customer, and the customer shall pay the charges for the entire
period of inaccurate billing, if that period is identifiable by the
municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing is not identifiable,
undercharges will be calculated based on a time period that is shortest of the
time elapsed since the customer's service began, that date of installation of
the faulty meter or implementation of the error resulting in the undercharge
(if applicable), or 365 days. Undercharges billed to customers shall in no
event exceed a period of 365 days. Customers shall have the option to pay the
amount undercharged in equal payments spread over the same number of months as
the charges were accumulated.
      (3)   This section does not serve as a limitation to billing for
undercharges which are the result of tampering with utility equipment or theft
of utility services, or where a physical act of a customer or its agent causes
inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading, or inaccurate or no
measurements rendered.

            The procedures used shall ensure the sample to be a representative
sample of the flow.
            The average strengths, in mg/l, of BOD, COD, suspended solids and
phosphorus for each strength surcharge billing period shall be determined from
the information submitted in the strength analysis report for samples collected
during the billing period. The Division shall periodically collect and test
samples of the discharge. If the information is substantially different from
that on the strength analysis report, the values obtained from such samples may
be used to determine surcharge strengths in lieu of the values in the strength
analysis report.
      (2)   Compliance reports:
         A.   New source compliance deadline. New sources shall install and
have in operation condition and shall start-up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to

standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.
         D.   Additional periodic compliance reports shall be submitted by all
categorical and non categorical users at a frequency specified in the
wastewater contribution permit, indicating the nature and concentration of
prohibited or regulated substances in the discharge. These reports shall also
include a record of all measured average and maximum flows during the reporting
period, the results of sampling and analyses and any other information required
to the Division.
         E.   If a user's sampling data indicates a violation, the user must
notify the City within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation.

   (b)   Accidental Discharge. Each user, at his expense, shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastewaters subject to these regulations. Users shall notify the Superintendent
immediately upon the occurrence of a slug load or accidental discharge of such
prohibited materials or wastewaters. This notification shall be followed,
within fifteen days of the date of occurrence, by a detailed written statement
describing the cause of the discharge and the remedial measures in effect. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of liability for any expense, loss or
damage to the sewage works. The cost of treating the discharge shall be paid by
the user.
   (c)   Operation Upsets and Bypasses. Any user who is unintentionally or
temporarily in a state of noncompliance with these regulations, due to factors
beyond his reasonable control, shall inform the Division as soon as possible
after commencement of the operating upset, but not longer than twenty-four
hours following the start of the upset. Where information is given orally, the
user shall file a written follow-up report with the Division within five days.
The report shall:
      (1)   Describe the incident, its cause and its impact on the user's
compliance status;

      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the conditions of noncompliance.
      (4)   A user may bypass all or part of its discharge past pretreatment
units providing the discharge meets its governing discharge requirements of
local limits and is essential for maintenance of such units. All other bypasses
are prohibited except where they are to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage. With the consent of the City, bypasses, for which
there is no favorable alternative action, may be allowed. If a user knows in
advance of the need of a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the
Superintendent if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. A
user shall submit an oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable pretreatment standards to the Superintendent within twenty-four
hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written report
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The report shall contain a description of the bypass, its cause,
duration, including exact dates and times and steps taken to reduce, eliminate
and prevent bypass reoccurrence.
   A documented and verified operating upset shall be an affirmative defense to
any enforcement action brought by the Division against a user for noncompliance
with these regulations.
   (d)   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's
premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug load,
accidental discharge or operating upset. Employers shall instruct all employees

protection of the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the City to
levy and collect service charges or sewer rentals, including strength
surcharges, on all premises served by, having connection with, or having access
to, the sanitary sewerage system and the sewage treatment plant of the City.
The proceeds of these charges or rentals shall be for the use of the sanitary
sewerage system and treatment plant as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 80-55. Passed 12-3-80.)
1042.02 SEWER RENTAL FUND.
   The funds received from the collection of charges as hereinafter authorized
shall be deposited with the City Auditor and shall be accounted for and known
as the Sewer Rental Fund. When appropriated by the Council the funds shall be
available for the payment of the cost and expense of the construction,
administration, management, operation, maintenance, enlargement and replacement
of the sewerage system and for the payment of the principal and interest for
the bonds issued and outstanding and to be issued for any debt incurred for the
construction of the sewerage system or for acquisition of necessary easements
or for purchase of land.
(Ord. 80-55. Passed 12-3-80.)
1042.03 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   For the purposes provided in Section
1042.02, sewer service charges shall be levied and assessed on each lot, parcel
of land, building or premises having any sewer connections with the sanitary
sewerage system of the City or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes,
water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the City sanitary
sewerage system.
   (a)   The sewer service charges shall consist of the base charge, the volume
charge, the strength surcharge and the industrial waste surveillance charge as
follows.
      (1)   Base charge. The flat rate fee charged to each account which covers
the first 200 cubic feet of sewage used per month.
      (2)   Volume charge. The service charge based on the volume of standard
strength sewage in excess of the first 200 cubic feet of sewage and charged to
all accounts in addition to the base charge. Standard strength sewage shall
include maximum strengths as follows.
         Biochemical oxygen demand (five day)      200 milligrams per liter
         Suspended solids                   250 milligrams per liter
         Phosphorus                     10 milligrams per liter
      (3)   Strength surcharge. The charge based on the number of pounds of
chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids and
phosphorus in excess of the amount in standard strength sewage and charged to
all industrial accounts in addition to all other charges.
      (4)   Industrial waste surveillance charge. The flat rate fee charged to
each industrial class account in addition to all other charges.
      (5)   Long-term control plan charge. The flat rate fee charged to each
account to pay for capital costs associated with the South Interceptor Sewer
Project, which shall remain in place until retirement of any debt issued in
connection with the South Interceptor Sewer Project.
      A separate account shall be established for each meter used to establish
volumes of sewage flow.
   (b)   The classes of users shall be as follows.
      (1)   The domestic class shall include all single or multiple-unit
residential accounts with domestic-type sewage only. A residence which includes
a commercial establishment shall be considered a domestic account if the sewage
produced is primarily domestic in nature and the flow contributed by the
commercial activities of the establishment is a secondary flow of the sewer
connection.
      (2)   The commercial class shall include all nonresidential accounts that
are not required to be in the industrial class. Transient residences shall be
commercial accounts.
      (3)   The industrial class shall include all accounts from users who
discharge to the City's wastewater disposal system liquid wastes resulting from
the processes employed in industry or manufacturing, or from the development of
any natural resource.
      (4)   The mega industrial class shall include all accounts from users who
discharge to the City's wastewater disposal system liquid wastes resulting from
the processes employed in industry or manufacturing, or from the development of
any natural resource at volumes above 700,000 cubic feet per month.
(Ord. 80-55. Passed 12-3-80; Ord. 2010-17. Passed 5-17-10; Ord. 2019-21. Passed
6-3-19.)
1042.04 DETERMINATION OF EXTRA STRENGTH VOLUME SURCHARGE.
   The standard strengths for biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids and
phosphorus, as shown in Section
1042.03, shall be subtracted from the average strengths, as determined in
Section
1040.29(c), to determine the extra strengths of each industrial class user for
each strength surcharge billing period. The extra strengths and the volume of
sewage charged for the billing period shall then be used to determine the
weight in pounds of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS) and
phosphorus (P) to be charged for strength surcharge. The BOD surcharge shall be
based on pounds of BOD or 0.5 times the pounds of COD, whichever is greater.

through or immediately adjacent to a new development shall remain the
responsibility of the developer. Such improvement shall comply with the
policies and standards outlined in the City's Subdivision Regulations and
Zoning Code where they apply.
   (c)   No portion of this chapter or any statement herein or subsequent
Council interpretation policies shall relieve any property owner of assessments
levied against his or her property for public facility improvement projects
except as otherwise stated herein.
   (d)   It is the policy of the City to participate in improvement of storm
drainage facilities when authorized by Council. To be considered for approval
by Council, a facility must:
      (1)   Be either a new public facility or be a rehabilitation replacement
of existing public facilities: or
      (2)   Be a major benefit to the community.
   (e)   The City shall maintain all public storm drainage facilities located
within City-owned land, public rights of way and public easements. Public
facilities include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Open drainageways owned by the City or where the City has public
drainage easements;
      (2)   A piped drainage system and its related appurtenances which have
been designed and constructed expressly for use by the general public;

   (c)   All such charges shall be placed in the Storm Drainage Fund which
shall be used only for the purposes stated herein.
   (d)   Council finds that property is generally furnished service in
proportion to the amount of the property's impervious surface. The amount of
impervious surface is judged by the premises usage and size. All residential
premises (R-1, R-2, R-3) are to be viewed as receiving comparable benefits.
Commercial and industrial premises are furnished service in proportion to their
size, which also corresponds to the size of their building and parking area.
   (e)   Rates shall be maintained and set by action of Council by separate
ordinance. Council shall set rates and appropriate funds in such a manner that
in no year shall the operating budget of the storm drainage utility show a
loss.
   (f)   The owner of any property subject to a charge provided for herein
shall pay the same when due to the City. If any charges due hereunder are not
paid when due, the City Auditor shall collect them by actions at law in the

repugnant to the existing ordinances of the City or the laws of the State,
shall have the same effect and force as an ordinance.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.05 PURCHASED POWER COST ADJUSTMENT APPLICABLE TO CITY'S ELECTRIC RATE
SCHEDULES.
   (a)   Applicability. The purchased power cost adjustment set forth in this
section shall apply to the City's electric rate schedules that are subject to
this section. The applicable adjustment shall be applied to the total kWh
billed to the consumer for the meter reading period that the City determines to
be most nearly corresponding to the meter reading periods set forth in the
City's purchased power billings from its suppliers.
   (b)   Base Purchased Power Cost. The rates and charges set forth in the
City's rate schedules are based on the cost of the City's power requirements as
furnished through American Municipal Power Inc. (AMP). The base purchased power
cost included in the City's rate schedules is $0.073000 per kWh.
   (c)   Monthly Determination of Purchased Power Cost Adjustment.
      (1)   Each month the City's purchased power cost adjustment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   The City's rolling three-month average purchased power cost per
kWh shall be determined to six decimal places by dividing the sum of the two-
prior month’s and the current month's total purchased power billings from all
power suppliers, including transmission related costs and development costs
associated with future power supply resources, by the total energy delivered to
the City during the two prior months and the current month.
         B.   The base purchased power cost of $0.073000 per kWh shall then be
subtracted from the monthly purchased power cost determined in paragraph (c)
(1)A. hereof.
         C.   The purchased power cost adjustment per kWh shall be determined
by multiplying the differential derived in paragraph (c)(1)B. hereof by 1.10 to
compensate for the City's distribution system losses. The result should then be
rounded out to the nearest 0.10 mill ($0.0001) per kWh.
      (2)   The adjustment described in this subsection (c) shall also be
applicable to the security light charges, as set forth in Sections
1046.54 through
1046.61.

1046.20 DETERMINATION OF kW BILLING CAPACITY AND CHARGE.
   (a)   The kW billing capacity shall be the highest measured fifteen-minute
integrated or equivalent thermal kW capacity determined to the nearest kW by
means of suitable metering equipment, but not less than the kW that is equal to
fifty percent of the total kVa of installed or allocated transformer capacity,
nor less than sixty percent of the highest kW capacity measured during the
preceding eleven months, nor less than the minimum billing capacity specified
in the consumer's contract with the Utility.
   (b)   The Utility reserves the right, at any time, to install capacity
metering equipment. The Utility will normally install capacity metering
equipment when the consumer's usage in any month exceeds 1,000 kWh.
   (c)   Where capacity metering equipment is installed and the power factor at
the time of maximum measured capacity is less than ninety percent, the Utility
reserves the right to determine the billing capacity based on the measured kVa
capacity instead of kW capacity. Where capacity metering equipment is not
installed, the billing capacity may be estimated by the Utility based on tests
or another reasonable basis as determined by the Utility.
   (d)   For highly fluctuating loads, such as welders, hoists and the like,
the measured capacity in kW shall be increased by the amount that is equal to
fifty percent of the separately installed or allocated kVa of transformer
capacity required to supply such fluctuating loads.
   (e)   Where the service installation qualifies for single billing, as
specified under Section
1046.28, and separate single and three-phase meters are installed, the billing
capacity shall be the arithmetical sum of the recorded maximum kW capacities.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.21 MONTHLY MINIMUM CHARGE PER SERVICE.
   The monthly minimum charge shall be the sum of the applicable Service Charge
and Demand Charge, but not less than the minimum charge that may be specified
by contract with the Utility. For temporary service furnished to fairs,
carnivals and the like, the consumer shall pay for all of the up and down
installation costs specified in the Utility's general rules and regulations,
and the minimum billing period shall be one month. Where installations are of
an unusual character as to electric usage requirements or investment, the
monthly minimum charge and minimum billing capacity will be determined by the
Utility and shall be set forth in the service application or contract with the
consumer.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85; Ord. 2018-05. Passed 2-19-18.)

1046.23 TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (a)   The rates and charges set forth in this schedule are net as shown and
reflect the discount allowed from the gross rates if all accounts due and
payable are paid by the date specified on the bill. If not so paid, for current
month billing, the gross rates, which are five percent higher than the unpaid
current month net billing, shall be due and payable. That loss of discount
shall be applied only once to any initial unpaid billing amounts.
   (b)   If any bill is not paid within ten days after the payment date
specified on the bill the customer will be placed on notice for disconnection.
Following any notice of disconnection, if the customer's bill is not paid in
full on or before the date specified on the following bill, service shall be
subject to disconnection as provided in the utility's rules and regulations. To
partially compensate the utility for the additional expense involved, any
disconnection or reconnection of service shall be subject to the utility's
applicable trip charge.

required to adequately supply the consumer's existing and probable future
requirements, the Utility reserves the right to require the consumer to make
the necessary complete substation installation. In such an event, all service
will be billed under the Utility's Schedule LP.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.25 CHARACTER OF SERVICE.
   (a)   For new installations, service will normally be supplied through a
single set of service wires with all service delivered to a single meter
location. Under such conditions a single bill will be rendered for service. The
Utility reserves the right to use separate single and three-phase meters and to
add or combine the meter readings as provided in Section
1046.21.
   (b)   The voltage may, at the Utility's option, be either 120/240 volt
single-phase, three wire; 240 or 480 volt, three-phase, three wire; or 120/208
or 277/480 volt three-phase, four wire. See Section
1046.33 as to the availability of three-phase service.
   (c)   If the consumer desires a voltage that is impractical for the Utility
to furnish, the consumer shall furnish at his or her expense the necessary
transformer to deliver such voltage.

four wires extending to a single meter location to be designated by the
Utility, a single bill will be rendered, whether or not the Utility elects to
use single or multiple metering.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.27 MULTIPLE BILLING FOR SERVICE SUPPLIED THROUGH MULTIPLE SERVICE DROPS.
   Where service is delivered through individual and separately metered single
and three-phase service drops at different meter locations, a separate bill
will be rendered for each service drop.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.28 MULTIPLE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR SINGLE BILLING.
   If the consumer arranges his or her wiring at his or her cost so that all
requirements can be supplied by means of a single three or four-wire service
drop extending to a single meter location designated by the Utility, and
provided that such service can be supplied from a single transformer bank and
metered through a single meter, a single bill will be rendered for such
service. In place of a single meter, the Utility reserves the right to use
separate single and three-phase meters in order to determine compliance as to
the minimum charge provided in Section
1046.21(c).
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)

   In determining the consumer's classification for billing purposes, any
establishment carrying a business, professional, commercial or nonresidential
telephone directory listing shall automatically be classified as being
nonresidential in character and Schedule GS shall apply. However, the absence
of such listing shall not be the determining factor in establishing whether or
nor the service utilization is nonresidential in character. See Section
1046.31 as to the option for combined service.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.31 COMBINED RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL SERVICE.
   Where the premises are used and occupied by the consumer both for a
residential and as a nonresidential establishment for nonresidential use, as
defined in Section
1046.30, all service shall be billed under Schedule GS, or at the consumer's
option the wiring may be separated, subject to the Utility's inspection and
approval, and each class of service will be separately metered and billed under
each applicable schedule.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.32 SERVICE TO NONRESIDENTS.
   (a)   Service furnished outside of the City's corporate limits shall be
considered general service in character where such service is not incidental to
residential use or where such service is used for the preparation or processing
of food or other products to the extent that the same are substantially in a
form that they can be used or can be readily adopted for use by, or for sale
to, the ultimate consumer.
   (b)   In addition, all electric service supplied outside the City's
corporate limits for activities, purposes or uses, that when carried on within
the City's corporate limits would be classified as being nonresidential in
character, and so billed, shall likewise be considered and defined as
nonresidential in character and Schedule GS shall apply. For combined service,
see Section 1046.31.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)
1046.33 AVAILABILITY OF THREE-PHASE SERVICE.
   (a)   Normally only single-phase service is available. The Utility may,
however, at its option, furnish three-phase service, but only if such service
is already available immediately adjacent to the consumer's property and if it
is practical and economical for the Utility to furnish three-phase service,
after giving consideration to the investment required and probable use of
three-phase service by the consumer and provided the consumer enters into an
appropriate contract that recognizes the investment involved.
   (b)   The minimum charge and financing of any three-phase line extension
shall conform to the Utility's general rules and regulations.
(Ord. 85-30. Passed 5-22-85.)

determined by measurements, using the highest thirty-minute integrated or
equivalent thermal kW and kVar capacity. The monthly kVar billing capacity
shall be equal to the highest measured kVar capacity witnessed during the
billing period, as determined in this section. For consumers with a time-
differentiated demand metered installed, the measured kW demand will be the
greater of the maximum kW demand in the on-peak period or 25% of the maximum kW
demand during the off-peak period. The on-peak period is defined as the twelve-
hour period between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. local time on all non-holiday weekdays.
All other time is defined as off-peak. Holidays are New Years Day, Memorial
Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanks giving Day and Christmas Day.
   (b)   Where highly fluctuating or intermittent loads, welding machines,
electric furnaces, hoists, elevators, X-rays and the like are operated by the
consumer, the Utility reserves the right to determine the kW capacity by

the fifteen-minute measured maximum kW capacity in operation by the consumer by
fifty percent of the nameplate rating in kVa of that fluctuating load
equipment.
   (c)   Where such fluctuating loads require additional or separate
transformers or additional system capacity, the measured kW capacity, as
determined above, shall be increased by seventy percent of the nameplate rated
kVa capacity of the separate transformer that serves such fluctuating loads.
   (d)   The kW billing capacity shall be determined as above, but in no event
shall it be less than the highest kW as determined by any of the following
methods, nor less than 500 kW:
      (1)   The minimum kW capacity specified by the Utility and set forth in
the consumer's service application or contract with the Utility. In specifying
the minimum contract capacity in kW, the Utility will take into consideration
the system capacity and companion investment required or reserved in order to
adequately supply both the consumer's initial and probable future requirements.
      (2)   Fifty percent of the highest kVa installed or allocated transformer
capacity used to supply the consumer's requirements, whether or not the same is
furnished by the Utility or the consumer.

(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.66 SUPPLEMENTAL POWER COST ADJUSTMENT.
   The rates and charges set forth herein are intended to recover costs
associated with delivering power and energy acquired by the customer over the
Utility's transmission system. Should customer fail to acquire and/or arrange
for the delivery of sufficient power and energy to meet its load and energy
requirements, Utility may, at its option, supply supplemental power and energy
to meet customer's load and energy requirements, in which case customer shall
pay 110% of all costs incurred by Utility in connection with acquiring, and
arranging for the delivery of, supplemental power and energy required to serve

(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.67 DETERMINATION OF MONTHLY kW AND kVar BILLING DEMAND.
   (a)   The kW and kVar demand (to nearest kW and kVar) shall normally be
determined by measurements, using the highest 60-minute integrated or
equivalent thermal kW and kVar demand. The monthly kVar billing demand shall be
equal to the highest measured kVar demand witnessed during the billing period,
as determined in this section. The monthly kW billing demand will be the
greater of the maximum measured kW demand during the on-peak period or 33% of
the maximum measured kW demand during the off-peak period. The on-peak period
is defined as the 12-hour period between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. local time on
all non-holiday weekdays during the months of June, July, August and September.
All other time is defined as off-peak. Holidays are Independence Day and Labor
Day.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.68 METERING SERVICE AT PRIMARY OR SECONDARY VOLTAGE.
   (a)   The Utility reserves the right to meter all service at either primary
or secondary voltage. For billing purposes, the Utility shall determine whether
the metering is to be considered as being primary or secondary.
   (b)   If the Utility defines the service as being metered at secondary
voltage, then, for billing purposes, the metered kWh, kW and kVar will be
multiplied by 1.03.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.69 TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (a)   The above rates and charges are net as shown and reflect the discount
allowed from the gross rates if all accounts due and payable are paid by the
date specified on the bill. If not so paid, for the current month billing, the
gross rates, which are 5% higher than the unpaid current month net billing,
shall be due and payable. That loss of discount shall be applied only once to
any initial unpaid billing amounts.
   (b)   If any bill is not paid by the date specified, service shall be
subject to disconnection and, to partially pay for the additional expense
involved, any reconnection of service shall be subject to the charges set forth
in the Utility's general rules and regulations.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.70 SERVICE VOLTAGE.
   Service will be supplied through a single set of service wires. The service
voltage shall be 69,000 volts, unless Utility agrees to supply service at a
lower voltage, in which case the capacity charge per kW of billing demand shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.71 MOTOR SPECIFICATIONS.
   In order to avoid the operation or starting of motors that are detrimental
to service furnished to other consumers, the Utility reserves the right to
require that such motors be equipped with such reduced voltage or other control
devices as are necessary to avoid detrimental service to the Utility's other
consumers.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.72 THREE-PHASE OPERATION FOR HIGHLY FLUCTUATING OR UNBALANCED LOADS.
   For highly fluctuating loads, such as welders, electric melting furnaces or
other unbalanced single phase loads, the Utility reserves the right to require
that such loads be converted to three-phase operation so that, as far as is
practical, the load on each phase is balanced.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.73 POWER FACTOR CORRECTIVE EQUIPMENT.
   Where the consumer installs power factor corrective equipment, the Utility
may require the consumer to install, at his or her expense, such control
devices as are necessary to prevent excessive or detrimental voltage variations
on the Utility's system, in the event of noncompliance by the consumer, the
kVar billing capacity will be determined as though the power factor correction
equipment was disconnected.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.74 RESALE, SUBMETERING OR SHARING OF SERVICE.
   Under no condition shall service be resold, sub-metered or shared with
others. Violation of this section shall be cause for disconnection of service.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.75 GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   For further details as to the rights, responsibilities and obligations of
both the Utility and the consumer, see the Utility's general rules and
regulations.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.76 CONTRACT FOR SERVICE; PROVISIONS.
   A written contract will be required to cover service furnished under this
schedule, the term to depend upon investment required by the City, revenue to
be received, and the like. The contract shall specify the monthly minimum
charge, the minimum billing demand, the contribution in aid of construction, if
any, and related matters required to protect the Utility's investment and to
secure payment of the consumer's accounts.
(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 9-14-15.)
1046.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for

   The SWPPP must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The
SWPPP must clearly describe for each major construction activity the
appropriate control measures; the general sequence during the construction
process under which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor
responsible for implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install
perimeter controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until
final stabilization). The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures. The SWPPP must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices. The SWPPP must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWPPP. The SWPPP must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWPPP shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWPPP shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond. Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the upslope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. Concentrated storm water runoff and runoff
from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet
protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through sediment
settling pond or equivalent best management practice upon approval from the
Engineering Department.
      The sediment settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67 cubic
yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When determining
the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas which remain
undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless runoff from these
areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is not co-mingled
with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment-settling pond must be
less than or equal to five feet. The configuration between the inlets and the
outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each one unit
of width (> 2:1 length:width ratio). Sediment must be removed from the
sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40%. This
limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth.
When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public
safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to ten acres.
   Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres)    Range of Slope
to 100 linear feet of silt fence for a drainage area (%)
0.50                             <2%
0.25                             ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                            ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection,
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practice must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than two inches in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainfall and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
         C.   Additional BMPs. Based on site conditions, the Engineering
Department may require additional best management practices to control off-site
tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
            1.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the
perimeter of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
            2.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas
must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or
to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with subsection (g) hereof.
            3.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Engineering Department may require
dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Stream protection. Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWPPP.
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource or
wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls. No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials. A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck washout. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is strictly
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available by
the owner/developer, etc.
      (3)   Fuel/liquid tank storage. All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal. Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated soils disposal and runoff. Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWPPP shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period as determined by the City
using the City's rain gages. The applicant shall assign qualified inspection
personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices are
functional and to evaluate whether the SWPPP is adequate, or whether additional
control measures are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals
with knowledge and experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment
and erosion controls. These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWPPP shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City or an alternate form acceptable
to the Engineering Department.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
the personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major
observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP, a certification as to
whether the facility is in compliance with the SWPPP, and information on any
incidents of non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWPPP shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all upslope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Engineering Department. When inspections
reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of erosion and
sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment-settling ponds must be
repaired or maintained within ten days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWPPP and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWPPP must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWPPP are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that
the planned control is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (j)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Engineering Department.

      (2)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by storm
water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
      (3)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
      (4)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   (c)   This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the City
of Wapakoneta under the specifications of Section
1232.07. This chapter also applies to land development activities that are
smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of
a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability
criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development
activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
   (d)   The following activities may be exempt from these storm water
performance criteria:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by the City of Wapakoneta, as applicable;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures;

(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.07   WAIVERS TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Every applicant shall provide for storm water management as required
by this chapter unless a waiver is granted. Requests to waive the storm water
management plan requirements shall be submitted to the City of Wapakoneta
Engineering Department for approval. The minimum requirements for storm water
management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the
applicant, provided at least one of the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm
water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that
has been approved by the City of Wapakoneta and the implementation of the plan
is required by local chapter.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater
than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the
storm water practice.
      (4)   The City of Wapakoneta finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce the
generation of storm water from the site, the size and cost of storm water
storage and the pollutants generated at the site. The amount of credit
available for using such practices shall be determined by the City of
Wapakoneta.
   (b)   In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the City of
Wapakoneta may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these storm water
management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided.
However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City of Wapakoneta that the variance will not result in the
following impacts to downstream waterways:
      (1)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
      (2)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      (3)   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
      (4)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
   (c)   When a waiver from the minimum on-site storm water management
requirements is granted, the applicant will be required to meet one of the
mitigation measures selected by City of Wapakoneta. Mitigation measures may
include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands
should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat,
      (2)   The creation of a storm water management facility or other drainage
improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that
currently lack storm water management facilities designed and constructed in
accordance with the purposes and standards of this chapter,
      (3)   Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund storm water management
activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macro-invertebrates,
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies, and monitoring of storm water management practices).
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.08   GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the City of Wapakoneta to be exempt or granted a waiver,
the following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water
management at all sites:
   (a)   All site designs shall establish storm water management practices to
control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of storm water. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate
storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   (b)   All storm water runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated storm water directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the City of Wapakoneta. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE)
or the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency responsible for natural resources.
   (c)   For new development, structural storm water treatment practices shall
be designed to remove eighty percent of the average annual post development
total suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a STP complies with this
performance standard if it is:
      (1)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQV).
      (2)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in
the local storm water design manual,
      (3)   Constructed properly, and
      (4)   Maintained regularly.
   (d)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided in accordance with accepted best
management practices.
   (e)   Storm water discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas,
water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or
may need to utilize or restrict certain storm water management practices.
   (f)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a storm
water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under
the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan requirement applies
to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (g)   Storm water discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
   (h)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the City of
Wapakoneta Engineering Department to determine if they are subject to
additional storm water design requirements.
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.09   BASIC STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   All storm water management practices will be designed so that the
specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality,
channel protection, ten year, 100 year) as identified in the current storm
water ordinance are met, unless the City of Wapakoneta grants the applicant a
waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements.
   (b)   If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than
that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City of Wapakoneta
reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed
necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   (c)   Storm water management practices for a site shall be chosen based on
the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be
considered:
      (1)   Topography;
      (2)   Maximum drainage area;
      (3)   Depth to water table;
      (4)   Soils;
      (5)   Slopes;
      (6)   Terrain;
      (7)   Head; and
      (8)   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or
ultra-urban areas.
   (d)   All storm water management practices shall be designed to convey storm
water to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Maximizing of flow-paths from inflow points to outflow points;
      (2)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
      (3)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; and
      (4)   Providing of underdrawn systems, where applicable.
   (e)   Every storm water treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of
water quality pretreatment. Certain storm water treatment practices are
prohibited even with pretreatment in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Storm water is generated from highly contaminated source areas
known as "hotspots".
      (2)   Storm water is carried in a conveyance system that also carries
contaminated, non-storm water discharges.
      (3)   Storm water is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge
area.
      (4)   Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit the
proper pretreatment of storm water.
   (f)   All storm water management practices shall be designed to capture and
treat storm water runoff according to Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
requirements. These requirements will designate the water quantity and quality
treatment criteria that apply to an approved storm water management practice.
   (g)   All storm water management practices must have a landscaping plan
detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage
and maintain this vegetation. This plan must be prepared by a registered
landscape architect or soil conservation district.
   (h)   All storm water treatment practices shall have an enforceable
operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed.
This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to
access and inspect the storm water treatment practices, and to perform routine
maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the storm water
treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the
parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all storm water treatment
practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land
disturbance activities.
   (i)   The use of non-structural storm water treatment practices is
encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in
the form of reductions in the amount of storm water that must be managed can be
earned through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the generation
of storm water from the site. Applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of
non-structural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and
remain unaltered by subsequent property owners.
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.10   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   No application for development will be approved unless it includes a
storm water management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated
water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or
managed. This plan must indicate whether storm water will be managed on-site or
off-site and, if on-site, the general location and type of practices.
   (b)   The storm water management plan(s) shall be referred for comment to
the Engineering Department, and any comments must be addressed in a final storm
water management plan. This final plan must be signed by a professional
engineer (PE) licensed in the State of Ohio, who will verify that the design of
all storm water management practices meet the submittal requirements outlined
in Sections
1232.11 and
1232.12. No building, grading, or sediment control permit shall be issued until
a satisfactory final storm water management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall
have undergone a review and been approved by the City of Wapakoneta.

1232.11   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT CONCEPT PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   A storm water management concept plan shall be required with all
permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps,
hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of
the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the
site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness
and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing storm water generated
at the project site. The intent of this conceptual planning process is to
determine the type of storm water management measures necessary for the
proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of storm water
runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the following
information shall be included in the concept plan:
      (1)   A map (or maps) indicating the location of existing and proposed
buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, structural storm water management
and sediment control facilities. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed
land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to
various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities, roads and easements;
the limits of clearing and grading; a written description of the site plan and
justification of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required.
      (2)   Sufficient engineering analysis to show that the proposed storm
water management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in
compliance with this chapter and Section
1248.05.
      (3)   A written or graphic inventory of the natural resources at the site
and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project and
a description of the watershed and its relation to the project site. This

topography, wetlands, and other native vegetative areas on the site. Particular
attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide
particular opportunities or constraints for development.
      (4)   A written description of the required maintenance burden for any
proposed storm water management facility.
      (5)   The City of Wapakoneta may also require a concept plan to consider
the maximum development potential of a site under existing zoning, regardless
of whether the applicant presently intends to develop the site to its maximum
potential.
   (b)   For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed
site, an applicant shall be required to include within the storm water concept
plan measures for controlling existing storm water runoff discharges from the
site in accordance with the standards of this chapter to the maximum extent
practicable.
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.12   FINAL STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   After review of the storm water management concept plan, and modifications
to that plan as deemed necessary by the City of Wapakoneta, a final storm water
management plan must be submitted for approval. The final storm water
management plan, in addition to the information from the concept plan, shall
include the following:
   (a)   Contact Information. The name, address, and telephone number of all
persons having a legal interest in the property and the tax reference number
and parcel number of the property or properties affected.

curve numbers or runoff coefficients, (iv) peak runoff rates and total runoff
volumes for each watershed area, (v) infiltration rates, where applicable, (vi)
culvert capacities, (vii) flow velocities, (viii) data on the increase in rate
and volume of runoff for the design storms referenced in Section
1248.05, and (ix) documentation of sources for all computation methods and
field test results.
   (d)   Soils Information. If a storm water management control measure depends
on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then a soils
report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site boring
logs or test pit profiles. The number and location of required soil borings or
test pits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine the
suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the
control measure.
   (e)   Maintenance and Repair Plan. The design and planning of all storm
water management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair
procedures to ensure their continued function. These plans will identify the
parts or components of a storm water management facility that need to be

(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.13   PERFORMANCE BOND/SECURITY.
   (a)   The City of Wapakoneta requires the submittal of a performance
security or bond prior to issuance of a permit in order to insure that the
storm water practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the
approved storm water management plan. The amount of the installation
performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the
storm water management practices approved under the permit, plus twenty-five
percent. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for
failure to complete work specified in the storm water management plan.
   (b)   The installation performance security shall be released in full only
upon submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a registered
professional engineer that the storm water practice has been installed in
accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this
chapter. The City of Wapakoneta will make a final inspection of the storm water
practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the
provisions of this chapter. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the
performance security based on the completion of various development stages can
be done at the discretion of the City of Wapakoneta.
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.14   NOTICE OF CONSTRUCTION COMMENCEMENT.
   (a)   The applicant must notify the City of Wapakoneta before the
commencement of construction. Regular inspections of the storm water management
system construction shall be conducted by the staff of the City Engineering
Department or certified by a professional engineer or their designee who has

      (3)   Variations from the approved construction specifications; and
      (4)   Any violations that exist.
   (b)   If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in
writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No
added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work
previously completed has received approval by the City of Wapakoneta.
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.15   AS BUILT PLANS.
   All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any storm
water management practices located on-site after final construction is
completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all storm
water management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer. A
final inspection by the City of Wapakoneta is required before the release of
any performance securities can occur.
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.16   LANDSCAPING AND STABILIZATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been
either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall
be revegetated within seven days from the substantial completion of such
clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation
efforts:
      (1)   Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established
over ninety percent of the seeded area.
      (2)   Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable
of controlling erosion.
      (3)   Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of
seventy percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following
revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the
minimum seventy percent survival for one year is achieved.
   (b)   In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be
submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and
management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed.
This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after
construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at
the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative
cover is preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape
architect or by the soil conservation district, and must be approved prior to
receiving a permit.
(Ord. 2014-42. Passed 1-5-15.)
1232.17   MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STORM WATER FACILITIES.
   (a)   Maintenance Easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a
storm water management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the
applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement
that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the storm
water management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the
facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City of Wapakoneta,
or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of
property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working
condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this
chapter. The easement agreement shall be recorded by the City of Wapakoneta in
the land records.
   (b)   Maintenance Covenants.
      (1)   Maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be
ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be
approved by the City of Wapakoneta and recorded into the land record prior to
final plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for
when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the
storm water management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for
periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between
scheduled cleanouts.
      (2)   The City of Wapakoneta, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may
accept dedication of any existing or future storm water management facility for
maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this chapter
and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or
otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
   (c)   Requirements for Maintenance Covenants. All storm water management
facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document
maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of
this chapter and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include:
removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and
drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement
of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a
timely manner, as determined by the City of Wapakoneta, and the inspection and
maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper
functioning of the storm water management facility.
   (d)   Inspection of Storm Water Facilities. Inspection programs may be
established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine
inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or
pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with
higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations
of State or Federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES storm
water permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and
evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other storm water
treatment practices.
   (e)   Right-of-Entry for Inspection. When any new drainage control facility
is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between
private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or
combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the City of Wapakoneta the
right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for
the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it
has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this chapter is occurring
or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance
or correction of a violation of this chapter.
   (f)   Records of Installation and Maintenance Activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a storm water management
facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and
repairs, and shall retain the records for at least five years. These records
shall be made available to the City of Wapakoneta during inspection of the
facility and at other reasonable times upon request.
   (g)   Failure to Maintain Practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses
to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the City of Wapakoneta,
after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or
maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in

1240.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This Title Four of Part Twelve of these Codified Ordinances shall be known
and may be cited as the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Wapakoneta,
Ohio, and shall be referred to throughout these Subdivision Regulations as
"these Subdivision Regulations" or just "these Regulations."
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1240.02 APPLICATION.
   The following provisions as provided hereinafter shall govern the
subdividing of land within the corporate limits of the City, and the provisions
of Sections
1240.01 to
1240.09,
1242.01 to
1242.07,
1244.01 to
1244.04 and
1246.01 to
1246.06 shall govern the subdividing of land in the unincorporated areas within
three miles beyond the corporate limits of the City.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1240.03 INTERPRETATION AND INTENT.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Regulations
shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the
public health, safety and welfare. To protect the public, among other purposes,
these provisions are intended to provide for permanently wholesome community
environment, adequate Municipal service and safe streets.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1240.04 SCOPE.
   These Regulations shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part of a
subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations. Nor is it intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul
or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or
ordinances, except those specifically repealed by these Regulations or with
private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant or other private
agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the
City is a party. Where these Regulations imposes a greater restriction upon
land than is imposed or required by these existing provisions of law,
ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of these Regulations shall control.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1240.05 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   No person shall subdivide or lay out into lots any land within the
City or within the unincorporated area lying within three miles of the
corporate area, unless it is by plat complying with these Regulations, and no
plan shall be recorded and no lot or land shall be sold from any plan until the
plat has been approved as herein required.
   (b)   The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform to the
requirements of Chapter 1246. The subdivider shall make improvements and shall
submit preliminary plans and a final plat, all in accordance with Chapters 1244
and 1248.
   (c)   The divisions of a tract into parcels fronting upon an existing
street, and where the transfer is to be accomplished by the recording of a deed
rather than a plat, requires the approval of the City Planning Commission
before it can be recorded. This approval may be accomplished in the manner
provided in Section
1244.04.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1240.06 VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape,
or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements of these Regulations would result in real
difficulties, substantial hardship or injustice, the requirements may be varied
or modified so that the subdivider may subdivide his or her property in a
reasonable manner. At the same time, the public welfare and interest of the
City and the surrounding area shall be thoroughly protected and the general
intent and spirit of these Regulations enforced.
   (b)   The requirements of these Regulations may also be varied or modified
whenever a plat is for a complete community or neighborhood, but any such
variance must ensure that adequate public spaces, circulation, recreation,
light and air will be provided and that the needs of the entire community where
fully developed and occupied, will be fully met.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1240.07 AMENDMENTS.
   The City Council and the City Planning Commission may, after public hearing,
amend, supplement or change this chapter. Notice shall be given of the time and
place of the public hearing by publication in at least one newspaper of general
circulation published in the City, thirty days prior to holding of the hearing.
The amendment or amendments shall be on file in the office of the Planning
Commission for public examination during the thirty days.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1240.08 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of these
Regulations is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.

1246.01 STREETS.
   (a)   Conformity With Major Thoroughfare Plan or Planning Commission
Recommendations. The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of
major, secondary and minor streets or highways shall conform with the official
Major Thoroughfare Plan for the City and with the provisions of this chapter.
Streets not contained in the official Major Thoroughfare Plan shall conform to
the recommendation of the Planning Commission based upon existing and planned
streets, topography, public safety and convenience and proposed uses of land.
   (b)   Design and Arrangement.
      (1)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision
for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas (or
their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar as they
may be deemed necessary for public requirements.
      (2)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide for convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be so
designed as to discourage through traffic, but off-set streets should be
avoided.
      (3)   The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All other streets
should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible, and no
intersection of streets at angles of less than seventy degrees shall be
permitted.
      (4)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic
which may otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin and
destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending for
considerable distances, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided.
   (c)   Alignment.
      (1)   Vertical. For main thoroughfares, profile grades shall be connected
by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to twenty times the algebraic
difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred. For
secondary and minor streets and alleys, profile grades shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to fifteen times the algebraic
difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred.
      (2)   Minimum horizontal. Radii of centerline curvature shall be as
follows:
         A.   Main thoroughfares: twelve degrees, 475 feet.
         B.   Secondary thoroughfares: nineteen degrees, 300 feet.
         C.   Minor streets: twenty-eight degrees, 200 feet
         D.   Streets shorter than 500 feet: fifty-eight degrees, 100 feet.
         A minimum fifty-foot tangent shall be introduced between reverse
curves.
      (3)   Visibility.
         A.   The minimum vertical visibility, measured four and one-half feet
eye level to a tail light eighteen inches above ground level, shall be as
follows:
            1.   500 feet on main thoroughfares.
            2.   300 feet on secondary thoroughfares.
            3.   200 feet on minor streets.
            4.   100 feet on streets shorter than 500 feet.
         B.   The minimum horizontal visibility shall be as follows:
            1.   500 feet on main thoroughfares, measured on the centerline.
            2.   300 feet on secondary thoroughfares, measured on the
centerline.
            3.   100 feet on all other streets, measured on the centerline.
   (d)   Street and Alley Width.
      (1)   The width of all major thoroughfares shall conform to the width
designated on the Major Thoroughfare Plan of the City and of the County.
      (2)   The minimum width of minor streets in single-family and two-family
districts shall be fifty feet, except that where there are unusual
topographical or other physical conditions, the Planning Commission may require
a greater or lesser width for a minor street. The minimum width of minor
streets serving multiple dwellings shall be sixty feet.
   (e)   Cul-De-Sacs. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turn-around
having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty feet. The outside of the road
surface within the turn-around right of way shall have a minimum radius of
forty feet.
   (f)   Dead-End Streets. Streets designated to be dead-ended permanently
shall not be permitted. Any dead-end street of a temporary nature, if longer
than 200 feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a surfaced turning area
equal in diameter to the width of such street at its termination.
   (g)   Half-Streets. Dedication of half-streets shall be discouraged. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to the tract
being subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
   (h)   Alleys. Alleys should be avoided in single-family or two-family
districts. They may, however, be required in multiple dwelling developments,
where they should have a minimum width of twenty feet. Alleys are required in
the rear of all commercial and industrial lots if no other provisions are made
for adequate service access or for parking. The rights of way of such alleys
shall not be less than twenty feet, and dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
   (i)   Street Grades. No street grade shall be less than one-half percent,
nor exceed the following percentages, with due allowances for reasonable
vertical curves:
      Main or arterial thoroughfares    5%
      Secondary thoroughfares      6%
      Minor streets            8%
   (j)   Street Names. Where new names are required for new streets in
unincorporated areas, the names shall meet the approval of the County Engineer.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1246.02 BLOCKS AND LOTS.
   (a)   Block Design.
      (1)   No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet nor less than 500 feet,
except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along the major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress or egress.
      (2)   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width may be required if necessary to provide proper
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and other facilities.
   (b)   Lots.
      (1)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development. All lots must have
full frontage on an improved public right of way. Private streets may be
considered for approval as a part of a condominium or multifamily dwelling
complex where provisions for perpetually maintaining the improvement become a
part of the documents prepared for transfer of ownership.
      (2)   All side lines of lots shall be at approximate right angles to
straight street lines and radial to curved street lines, except where a
variation to this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. Lots with
double frontage will be avoided.
      (3)   No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the zoning
regulations applicable to the area in which it is located.
      (4)   In case of unusual soil conditions or other physical factors which
may impair the health and safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may
be located, upon recommendation of the County Board of Health, or upon the
recommendation of the City Engineer/Surveyor or the County Engineer, the
Planning Commission may require larger lot widths and lot areas than might
otherwise be necessary.
      (5)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy-five feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a street
may be designated the front of a lot, provided that the rear yard shall always
be opposite the frontage so designated.
      (6)   All corner lots, whether they are at the intersection of the rights
of way of two streets or of an alley and a street, shall have a curve with a
minimum radius of twenty feet joining the two sidelines of the rights of way.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85; Ord. 88-46. Passed 9-
21-88.)
1246.03 BUILDING LINES.
   Where the subdivided area is not under control of the Zoning Code and is to
be used for residential purposes, the building lines shall be established
according to the following, but in no case shall the front building line be
less than thirty-five feet from the right of way of the street or thoroughfare
upon which the lots front.
   (a)   The minimum distance from the building line to the road right of way
for lots with an area of over 20,000 square feet shall be forty feet.
   (b)   The minimum distance from the building line to the road right of way
for lots with an area of more than 12,000 square feet, but not more than 20,000
square feet, shall be forty feet.
   (c)   The minimum distance from the building line to the road right of way
for lots with an area of 12,000 square feet or less shall be thirty-five feet.
   Restrictions requiring greater setbacks than provided above shall be shown
on the plat.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1246.04 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Generally. Easements of at least eight feet in width shall be provided
on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where necessary,
for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains. Easements may also be required along
or across lots where engineering design or special conditions may necessitate
the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights of way. A two-
foot easement shall be required on one side of an alley to accommodate pole
lines. For lots facing on curvilinear streets, the rear easement should consist
of straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection.
   (b)   Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is
located in the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall provide an adequate
easement along each side of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening,
relocating, improving or protecting the stream for drainage or public use.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1246.05 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   Where the subdivision contains a park, school or other public area
which is shown upon the Master Plan for the City or County, the area shall
either be dedicated to the proper public agency or it shall be reserved for
acquisition thereby within a specified period by a purchase or other means, and
an agreement shall be entered into between the subdivider and the proper public
agency regarding the time and method of acquisition and the cost thereof.
   (b)   Due regard shall be shown for preserving outstanding scenic, cultural
or historic areas.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1246.06 VARIANCES.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with the
subdivision design standards of this chapter an undue hardship upon the owner,
the Planning Commission may refer the problem of compliance to the Director of
Public Service and Safety, if the proposed subdivision is within the corporate
limits of the City, and to the County Engineer, if the proposed subdivision is
located in an unincorporated area, for recommendations as to permissible
variances.

1248.01 INSTALLATION OR BOND REQUIRED; CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS GENERALLY.
   Prior to the granting of final plat approval, the subdivider shall have
installed, or shall have furnished adequate bond for the installation of, the
improvements listed and described in this chapter. All of the required
improvements shall be made in full compliance with the specifications for each
of the various units of work, as required by the Director of Public Service and
Safety, the County Engineer, the County Sanitary Engineer or the County Board
of Health, according to the nature of the improvements.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1248.02 STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS.
   Street improvements and the installation of water lines, sanitary sewers and
storm drainage facilities within the corporate limits of the City shall be made
in full compliance with specifications and requirements of the Director of
Public Service and Safety. Street improvements and the installation of storm
drainage facilities in unincorporated areas shall be made subject to the
approval of the County Engineer. Installation of water lines, individual wells,
private water supply systems, sanitary sewers and individual or collective
sewage disposal facilities shall be made in accordance with the standards and
requirements of the County Sanitary Engineer and the County Board of Health.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1248.03 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   All streets and thoroughfares shall be graded to their full width, including
side slopes, and improved in accordance with the standards outlined or referred
to in these Regulations and as follows:
   (a)   Subgrade. The street subgrade shall be free of sod, vegetative or
organic matter, soft clay and other objectionable materials for a depth of at
least two feet below the finished surface of the subgrade. The subgrade shall
be properly rolled, shaped and compacted and shall be subject to the approval
of the Director of Public Service and Safety or the County Engineer, depending
upon jurisdiction.
   (b)   Minimum Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths. The minimum right-of-way and
pavement widths shall be as provided in the following table:
 
Class                  Minimum Right of Way Minimum Pavement Width
                       (in ft.)             (in ft.)
Primary thoroughfare   100                  36
Secondary thoroughfare 80                   36
Collector street       60                   36
Residential access     50                   30
Industrial access      70                   30
 
   In certain instances, especially where a commercial area is involved, where
no off-street parking facilities are provided and where no parking is permitted
on the street at any time, a parking lane at least eight feet wide on each side
of the street and paved to the satisfaction of and in accordance with the
specifications approved by the officials concerned, may be required in addition
to the necessary number of lanes for moving traffic. Where pavement widths
greater than those specified in the table above are necessary, provision of the
same shall be discussed with the public officials having jurisdiction over the
planning and construction of public ways to determine whether or not public
expenditures for such additional width can or should be made simultaneously
with the subdivider's improvement program.
   (c)   Pavement Design Alternatives.
      (1)   The subdivider has the option of using any of the following
pavement sections:
 
Class       Full Depth Asphalt (in ft.) Composite             Concrete (in ft.)
Primary     9                           5" AC on 13" base     8
Secondary   8                           4 1/2" AC on 11" base 7
Collector   7                           4" AC on 7" base      6
Residential 6                           3" AC on 9" base      6
Industrial  10                          6" AC on 11 1/2" base 8 1/2
 
      (2)   The subdivider shall also have the option of submitting pavement
design sections other than as specified above if, after subgrade
investigations, it can be shown by the subdivider's engineer that the pavement
section being proposed can be adequately supported under the anticipated
traffic volume load.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall have discretion in determining
whether the anticipated volume of traffic on the proposed street would warrant
a change in the classification of the street in question to that of a lesser or
greater classification.
   (d)   Surface Course Application. The Director of Public Service and Safety
and the County Engineer reserve the right to determine the proper time for the
application of the surface course, but in no event shall the subdivider be
required to defer the construction of the surface course for a period in excess
of that specified for the completion of the required improvements as provided
in Section
1248.10. The subdivider shall give prior notice to the Director of Public
Service and Safety or the County Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction, as to
the time when the construction of the base and surface courses is to be started
so that the work may be performed under the supervision of the official
concerned.
   (e)   Curbs and Gutters.
      (1)   The requirement of curbs or curbs and gutters will vary in
accordance with the character of the area and the density of development
involved. In urban or suburban areas, curbs are necessary to control storm
water runoff and to clearly define driving and parking areas.
      (2)   Curbs shall be required on all streets designed to serve areas
where the existing or anticipated density of the area surrounding the proposed
subdivision equals or exceeds three families per acre.
      (3)   Where residential lot frontages are less than eighty-five feet, in
commercial developments or where other similar intensive urban uses exist or
are anticipated, curbs shall ordinarily be required. The installation of curbs
may be required on major, secondary and minor highways if the construction is
deemed necessary for public safety.
      (4)   Where curbs exist on abutting properties, their extension will
ordinarily be required throughout the proposed subdivision.
      (5)   Where curbs are not required, adequate gutters shall be graded and
protected by seeding or appropriate surfacing.
      (6)   Curbs may be of the wall-type or may be combined with gutters built
of concrete. Curbs, combined curbs and gutters, and graded gutters, shall be
constructed in conformance with the current edition of the State of Ohio

Transportation Construction and Material Specifications, as the same pertains
to this type of improvement.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1248.05 STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEMS.
   (a)   General Requirements. All storm sewer designs shall be in accordance
with the following standards. All designs shall protect from flood damage and
inundation by storm water to any dwelling. Drainage water entering the
watershed shall be collected and routed from the area in approximately the same
location and manner that existed prior to the construction of the improvements.
Design of the drainage facilities within the drainage area shall be such that
they will not divert drainage area from one watershed to another.
   (b)   Design of Drainage Facilities.
      (1)   Hydrologic design. All drainage ways shall be designed in
accordance with the following criteria:
         A.   Major waterways: Major waterways are defined as those with a
tributary area in excess of four square miles. Major waterways shall be
designed for an average recurrence interval of 100 years.
         B.   Secondary waterways: Secondary waterways are defined as those
with a tributary area of between one and four square miles. Secondary waterways
shall be designed for an average recurrence interval of fifty years.
         C.   Minor waterways: Minor waterways are defined as those with one
square mile or less of tributary area. Minor waterways shall be designed for an
average recurrence interval of twenty-five years for open channels and
culverts.
         D.   Roadway storm sewer networks: All roadway storm sewer shall be
designed for an average recurrence interval of ten years.
      (2)   Hydraulic design.
         A.   The design hydraulic grade line for any closed or open waterway,
bridges or culverts shall be designed to contain the twenty-five-year rainfall
frequency within the proposed system. Storm sewers designed as part of a road
system with curb shall be designed so that the hydraulic grade line shall be no
higher than the inlet grates for a design discharge of the twenty-five- year
design discharge (Q).
         B.   For all roadway design improvements or developments, catch basins
shall be so placed along the streets that the width of flow does not impede
traffic. For acceptable spread requirements along a roadway, reference Ohio
Department of Transportation Location and Design Volume 2, the most current
addition.
         C.   The depth of flow or ponding for a 100-year average recurrence
interval storm shall not exceed a level which would cause inundation or damage
to any dwelling constructed within the project area.
         D.   Site grading within the development shall be such that all lots
will readily drain. Lots shall have a one percent minimum slope in grass areas.
Overland flow on lots shall be limited to a maximum distance of 300 feet unless
approved by the City of Wapakoneta.
         E.   Bridges spanning open waterways shall have minimum freeboard
above water surface of two feet.
         F.   The minimum velocity for any closed or open conduit shall be 2.5
feet per second under gravity flow conditions.
      (3)   Structural design. Catch basins, manholes, inlet structures, etc.
placed within an improvement or development shall conform to standard plans on
file with the City. Structural design of all drainage facilities shall be
subject to the approval of the City of Wapakoneta.
         A.   Channels/swales:
            1.   Minimum bottom width of constructed channels shall be two
feet. Each channel constructed shall have side slopes of 3:1 or flatter.
            2.   All permanent drainage swales shall be shown on the
construction plans with easements on the final plat.
            3.   Maintenance of all drainage swales through a development shall
be the responsibility of the developer or property owner.
            4.   Bank stabilization and stream bed stabilization, along
constructed or natural channels, will be required if the channel velocities are
sufficient to cause bank or invert erosion. The top of bank shall be so graded
that side drainage will enter channels only at points where structures are
provided to prevent bank erosion. Side drainage flow shall enter the channel as
nearly parallel with stream flow as possible. Earth channels shall be seeded or
sodded depending on the velocity of flow within the channel.
         B.   Closed conduits: The minimum conduit size for all main storm
lines shall be twelve inch pipe.
            1.   Minimum clearance between top of pipe and top of surface shall
be two feet. All pipes with clearance less than two feet shall be reinforced
concrete pipe. The alignment of closed conduits shall be as nearly straight as
practicable without bends and angle points; manholes shall be provided at all
angle points and at intervals not to exceed 300 feet along the conduit unless
submitted for approval with proper documentation. Inverted siphons shall not be
permitted except for temporary structures.
            2.   All pipe, bedding and backfill shall be designed in accordance
with the Ohio Department of Transportation Design Manual. Field tile/single
wall storm tile is NOT allowed. Ditch protection shall be required if the ten-
year flow velocities in a channel or waterway exceed four feet per second for
soil ditches or six feet per second in sodded ditches. If the exit velocity
from a storm sewer exceeds the allowable velocities, an energy dissipating
device (i.e. stilling basin, dumped rock) may be necessary.
      (4)   Storm water runoff control criteria for retention/detention basins.
Any development which increases the runoff rate and volume shall be required to
control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to its off-site
outlet.
         A.   Any increase in the volume of site surface drainage water
resulting from accelerated runoff caused by site development shall be
controlled so that the post development peak discharge rate does not exceed
that of the pre-development peak discharge rate, for all twenty-four-hour
storms between a one-year frequency and the critical storm frequency as
determined below. The method by which an applicant shall determine changes in
rates and volumes of runoff is presented in the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Engineering Division of the Soil Conservation Service, Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55, June 1986 or most current edition.
To find the critical storm frequency for which additional control will be
needed, the applicant shall:
            1.   Determine the percent increase in runoff volume for a one-year
frequency, twenty-four-hour storm occurring on the development area.
            2.   Determine the critical storm frequency for which additional
control is needed by using the percent increase in runoff volume, derived in
(a), in Table 1.
            3.   Control the post development storms of a frequency between one
year and the critical storm determined in (b), so as to be equal to or less
than the pre-development peak runoff rate for a twenty-four-hour one-year
frequency storm.
         B.   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than
the critical storm up to the one-hundred-year storm have peak runoff rates no
greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size storms under pre-
development conditions. Consideration of the one, two, five, ten, twenty-five,
fifty and 100-year storms shall be considered adequate in designing and
developing to meet this standard.
   Critical Year Storm Calculation:
   (1-year Post – 1-Year Pre) x 100%
      (1 Year Pre)
      (5)   Post construction runoff control. In order to:
         A.   Reduce increases in non-point pollution caused by storm water
runoff.
         B.   Minimize the total runoff volume which flows from a site
following increases in impervious area by development.
         C.   Minimize changes in the watershed hydrology inherent with
development.

            The drainage design shall incorporate post construction storm water
management requirements.
            1.   The post construction requirements of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency Construction Permit, OHC000002 shall be made part of these
regulations. The City of Wapakoneta shall be responsible for reviewing Part
III.G.2.e of the current permit. Please note, the current OHC000002 permit is
effective for five years. In subsequent OEPA Construction Permits or if the
current permit is revised, the applicable post construction parts of the
reissued or revised permit shall take precedence. Any revision in the plan need
to be reviewed by the City.
            2.   The site-specific characteristics shall be considered in the
design.
               a.   Minimum orifice sizes should be considered in areas of
soils with low permeability rates.
               b.   Infiltration systems in sites over well field areas shall
require the approval of the Health Department.
   (c)   Drainage Plan. The development drainage map shall include sufficient
data for the City to check the feasibility of the drainage system as proposed
by the developer. The following data shall be provided:
      (1)   Hydrologic calculation. At all critical points within the
development including catch basins:
         A.   Tributary drainage areas delineated on the map.
         B.   Times of concentration.
         C.   Intensity.
         D.   Runoff coefficients.
         E.   Design flow.
      (2)   Hydraulic calculations.
         A.   Sufficient documentation to indicate the results of the
investigation into the adequacy of the downstream drainage system to handle the
runoff from the proposed development. This will determine the maximum allowable
release rate for the proposed development and, in turn, the amount of storm
water storage that will be required.
         B.   The plan and profile of all drainage ways shall be provided,
imposed upon which shall be the design energy and hydraulic grade lines.
         C.   Sizes and types of drainage improvements, including special
structures, typical sections, right-of-way width and fencing.
         D.   Supporting calculations for upstream and downstream channel
capacities as they affect overflow, erosion or backwater within the
development. Such calculations shall be substantiated by such additional
information as is required to determine profile and cross section of the
upstream and downstream channel reaches under consideration.
         E.   Sufficient contours and grading details to indicate proposed
street grades and elevations throughout the development.
   (d)   Construction Plans.
      (1)   The final construction plans for drainage within the development
shall conform to the above provisions and to any special conditions as required
by the City of Wapakoneta in approving the tentative map. Such construction
plans for drainage shall be approved by the City of Wapakoneta prior to
construction of any drainage facilities within the development. A grading plan
with minimum finish floor elevations shall be submitted along with the
construction plans to identify the lot grading and in-tract drainage planned
for the development. The final construction drawings shall contain the
locations, widths, names of existing streets, railroad rights-of-way,
easements, parks, permanent buildings, and corporation and township lines;
location of wooded areas and other significant topographic and natural features
within and adjacent to the development property for a minimum distance of 200
feet.

      (2)   The designer should investigate the capacity of the immediate
downstream drainage facilities to determine if they will be adequate to handle
the design flow from this particular development. If the downstream facilities
are inadequate, it may be necessary to provide on-site detention or retention
basins to limit the flow to an amount which the downstream system can accept.
      (3)   A site grading plan with minimum finish grade shall be required by
the design engineer as a part of the construction plans. At a minimum, first
floor elevations should be shown. If minimum basement elevations are stated in
the plans, developer/owners must follow the plans or assume all risk. The
grading plan shall show all intended direction of surface water flow.
      (4)   All plans, calculations and design work need to be signed and
stamped by a professional engineer.
   (e)   Storm Water Runoff Policy. This design manual is based on the policy
that land uses and developments which increase the runoff rate or volume shall
be required to control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release of
off-site land. The purposes of this policy are:
      (1)   Permit development without increasing the flooding of other lands.
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their capacity
which may be caused by increases in the quantity and rate of water discharged.
      (3)   Establish a basis for design of a storm drainage system on lands
below undeveloped areas which will preserve the rights of property owners and
assure the long-term adequacy of storm drainage systems. This runoff control
policy applies to all land developments not specifically exempted below.
Exemptions are appropriate for certain land use activities which clearly do not
generate significant increases in storm water runoff.
      (4)   The following land uses and developments are within this exemption
category:
         A.   Land preparation for agricultural crops, orchards, woodlots, sod
farms and nursery operations.
         B.   Land grading or leveling for erosion control under direction of
the local soil conservation district.
   (f)   Proposed Guidelines for Detention Basins Statement or Purpose. As
urban development continues to transform previous watersheds into highly
impervious urban areas, the problem of handling the ever-increasing storm water
runoff on these watersheds is becoming more pronounced. In recent years, much
attention has been focused on detention basins as a means of controlling the
storm water runoff by detaining the water in the basin and releasing it at a
rate compatible with downstream conditions. Some basins have a multi-purpose
function, containing sport facilities, lakes and a park-like atmosphere during
dry periods. The recommendations presented in this report are intended to serve
this function. By following the recommendations, the detention basin can be
designed so as to obtain the maximum recreational aesthetic benefits for the
surrounding community while serving as an effective flood control mechanism.
      (1)   Planning guidelines. Detention basins serve to capture and
temporarily store the surface water runoffs which result from urban
development. This temporary storage allows for the release of the storm runoff
at discharge rates which are acceptable to the receiving waterway. On site
provision for detention storage would follow these approaches:
         A.   The release rate and volume of detention storage would be based
on previously mentioned design requirements and standards.
         B.   Recreational uses should be maximized where possible and
feasible.
         C.   Any development which the drainage exits the corporation limits
of the City and enters onto County, Township or State jurisdiction shall be
reviewed by the appropriate government official. A statement of comments must
be submitted by that official in writing.
         D.   Stormwater runoff of the pre-developed "sheet flow"
characteristics versus post-developed "point source" release of the storm water
exiting the site shall be taken into design consideration. Runoff from a
proposed development shall provide downstream energy dissipation.
         E.   Stormwater design shall take into consideration and provide
adequate drainage for neighboring upstream property surface or subsurface water
entering onto the proposed development or site. Offsite water may flow through
the property and is not subject to storm control as long as it does not
eventually enter the onsite detention basin.
         F.   All storm tiles found entering a proposed development or found
while excavating needs to be investigated. If the storm tile is found to be in
working condition, the storm tile must be replaced with new within the
development and rerouted as necessary to maintain proper flow and not conflict
with new utilities and/or structures.
         G.   If a storm tile is going to be abandoned, it must be totally
excavated and destroyed within the development.
      (2)   Detention basins. The bottom of the basin shall have a minimum
slope of 1.0 percent.
      (3)   Retention basins.
         A.   In order to provide for better management of the water, retention
basins shall have a permanent water area of at least one-half acre. The
permanent water area shall have an average water depth of four feet and no
extensive shallow areas.
         B.   In excavated lakes, the underwater side slopes shall be stable.
         C.   A safety ledge of two-foot-deep, five feet wide is required
around the perimeter of the basin.
      (4)   Detention and retention basins.
         A.   All developments/site improvements requiring detention/retentions
shall have a homeowners association established as a part of the plat
restrictions. The association shall be responsible for all pond and drainage
swale maintenance.
         B.   There shall be a minimum three-foot-wide berm at a two percent
slope between the right-of-way and the top of the basin slope.
         C.   Slopes on the sides of the basin shall have a maximum slope of 3:
1. This includes both sides of any constructed levy.
         D.   The minimum diameter of any outlet conduit shall be one foot.
         E.   Safety measures shall be provided for any pipe or opening to
prevent children or large animals from crawling into structures.
         F.   Danger signs should be mounted at appropriate locations to warn
of deep water, possible flood conditions that exist during storm periods and
other dangers that exist.
         G.   Retention pond design and maintenance shall include algae control
with pond additives. Fountain shall also be considered but are optional.
         H.   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be maintained
throughout the entire basin area. Grass shall be cut regularly, no less than
five times a year by the homeowner association.
         I.   Debris, trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall be
performed after each storm or as required to assure continued operation in
conformance with the design.
         J.   There shall be a minimum of one-foot freeboard between the 100-
year storm elevations and the flow line of emergency overflow measure.
         K.   All basins shall have an emergency overflow one foot below the
top of the levy or embankment containing the basin.
         L.   The City shall be notified prior to any adjustments to the
approved outlet structure to any detention or retention basin. No adjustment
shall be made until approved by the City.
         M.   The surface area opening for catch basin inlets shall be equal to
or greater than the design overland flow contributing water to that basin.
         N.   The site developer may pass on maintenance responsibilities to
the respective owner/homeowner's association via a maintenance agreement. The
maintenance agreement must be approved by the City and an approved copy must be
submitted to the City for their records.
      (5)   "As-built" drawings will be required for all basins to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements. This requirement shall include
calculations to confirm that the basin and outlet were constructed to function
as designed.
   (g)   Plan Approval. These drawings and calculations shall be certified by a
registered professional engineer. The construction of storm water drainage
improvements shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Safety
and Service or the County Engineer, depending on jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2018-35. Passed 7-16-18.)
1248.06 WATER.
   (a)   Public Water Supply and Distribution Systems.
      (1)   Public wells and other public water distribution systems shall meet
the current requirements of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and Ohio
R.C. Sections 6111.44 through 6111.46.
      (2)   After a public water main has been completed, it shall be
disinfected in accordance with AWWA C601-81, "Disinfecting Water Mains."
      (3)   After a main has been disinfected and flushed out, it shall be
subjected to a pressure and leakage test in accordance with AWWA C600-82.
      (4)   After a main has been disinfected and tested, samples will be
collected from the extremities and midpoints of the main by a representative of
the City and bacteriological tests shall be performed. If bacteriological tests
show the water to be safe, the main may be placed in service. If
bacteriological tests show the water to be unsafe, the main shall be completely
disinfected again at the expense of the developer.
   (b)   Individual Water Supply Systems.
      (1)   Where public water supply is not available, the subdivider shall
supply acceptable evidence of the availability of water. The subdivider may be
required to make one or more test wells in the area to be platted if such
evidence is deemed not acceptable.
      (2)   Copies of well logs which are obtained shall include the name and
address of the well driller and shall be submitted with the plat to the
Planning Commission.
      (3)   In all cases where it has been determined that individual water
supplies from private wells are not feasible, a public water distribution
system will be required.
(Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1248.07 SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   Public Sanitary Sewers; Extensions. If a subdivision can be reasonably
served by the extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by
the Planning Commission, the subdivider or developer shall provide a system of
sanitary sewer mains and shall provide lateral connections for each lot. Where
a public sanitary sewer is not reasonably accessible, the subdivider, the owner
or the developer may provide septic tanks for each lot, provided that the
septic tanks are installed in accordance with State and/or County Board of
Health requirements. Whenever main lines are installed, sewer and water mains
shall be extended to property lines of the subdivision. Connections to public
sanitary sewer lines shall be subject to the approval of and according to the
specifications of, the Director of Public Service and Safety or the County
Sanitary Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction.
   (b)   Private Sewage Facilities. In the event the installation of disposal
systems shall be considered, the subdivider shall confer with officials of the
County Board of Health as to the requirements and procedures to be observed.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1248.08 MONUMENTS.
   Chapter 4733-37, "Minimum Standards for Boundary Surveys in the State of
Ohio," as adopted by the Ohio State Board of Registration for Professional
Engineers and Surveyors, shall apply to the setting of monuments. The
subdivider shall have his or her surveyor certify to the Director of Public
Service and Safety or the County Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction, after
construction is complete, that all permanent markers have been set on all lot
corners and control points as of the date of his or her certification.
(Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)
1248.09 ELECTRICITY, GAS AND OTHER UTILITIES.
   Electrical service, gas mains and other utilities shall be provided within
each subdivision. Whenever these facilities are reasonably accessible and
available, they may be required to be installed within the area prior to the
approval of the final plat. Trees shall also be planted along the streets, and
the location and types of trees must meet the approval of the Director of
Public Service and Safety or the County Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2133. Passed 10-18-59; Ord. 85-61. Passed 12-18-85.)

substantially alter its appearance, drawings or sketches showing the front,
side and rear elevations of the proposed building or structure or of the
structure as this will appear after the work for which a permit is sought shall
have been completed, the existing and intended use of each building or
structure or part thereof, and the number of families or housekeeping units the
building is designed to accommodate; and when no buildings are involved, the
location of the present use and proposed use to be made on the lot and such
other information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots as may be
necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this Zoning Code. One
copy of such plans shall be returned to the owner when such plans shall have
been approved by the Zoning Administrative Officer, together with such zoning
certificate as may be granted. All dimensions shown on these plans relating to
the location and size of the lot to be built upon, shall be based on actual
survey. The lot and the location of the building thereon shall be staked out on
the ground, and approved as staked, before construction is started.
   (c)   Conditions Under Which Zoning Certificates are Required. A Zoning
Certificate shall be required for any of the following, except as herein
provided:
      (1)   Construction or alteration of any building, including accessory
buildings.
      (2)   Change in use of an existing building or accessory building to a
use of a different classification.
      (3)   Occupancy and use of vacant land.
      (4)   Change in the use of land to a use of a different classification.
      (5)   Any change in the use of a nonconforming use.
   (d)   Application for and Issuance of Zoning Certificate.
      (1)   Written application for a Zoning Certificate for the construction
of a new building or for the alteration of an existing building shall be made
at the same time as the application for a building permit. Said Zoning
Certificate shall be issued within 30 calendar days after a complete
application and fee for the same has been made to the Zoning Administrative
Officer or his or her agent, provided such construction or alteration is in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code and copies of all other
required permits are provided to the Zoning Administrative Officer or his or
her agent.
      (2)   Written application for a Zoning Certificate for the use of vacant
land, or for a change in the use of land or of a building, or for a change in a
nonconforming use as herein provided, shall be made to the Zoning
Administrative Officer. If the proposed use is in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code and all provisions of subsection (e) hereof have
been met, the certificate therefore shall be issued within 30 calendar days
after a complete application and fee for same has been made.
      (3)   At the time that an application for a Zoning Certificate is made, a
fee, in an amount determined by ordinance of Council, Section
1442.12 of the City Codified Ordinances, shall be paid to the City and shall be
credited to the General Fund of the City.
   (e)   Zoning Certificates for Nonconforming Uses. A Zoning Certificate shall
be required for all lawful nonconforming uses of land or buildings created by
adoption of this Zoning Code. Application for such certificate for a
nonconforming use shall be filed with the Zoning Administrative Officer by the
owner or lessee of the building or land occupied by such nonconforming use
within two years of the effective date of this Zoning Code. It shall be the
duty of the Zoning Administrative Officer to issue a certificate, at no charge,
for a lawful nonconforming use, but failure to apply for such certificate for a
nonconforming use, or refusal of the Zoning Administrative Officer to issue a
certificate for such nonconforming use, shall not be evidence that said
nonconforming use was either illegal or did not lawfully exist on the effective
date of this Zoning Code.
   (f)   Issuance Upon False Statement. Any Zoning Certificate issued upon a
false statement by the applicant shall be void. Whenever the fact of such false
statement shall be established, said Zoning Certificate shall be revoked by
notice in writing to be delivered to the holder of the void certificate upon
the premises concerned or in some conspicuous place upon said premises. Any
person who shall proceed thereafter with work or use without having obtained a
new Zoning Certificate, in accordance with this Zoning Code, shall be deemed
guilty of violation thereof.
   (g)   Failure to Commence Work. A Zoning Certificate which has been issued
for which no work has commenced within six months after issuance thereof, may
expire by limitation. In such case, the Zoning Administrative Officer shall
review the progress of the applicant and may extend, without fee, the Zoning
Certificate for an additional six months. Where work is commenced and then
abandoned for one year, the Zoning Certificate may expire by limitation and the
Zoning Administrative Officer or authorized representative may order the
incomplete structure to be removed by the owner. If so ordered and upon failure
of the owner to remove the same within one year, such owner shall be deemed
guilty of violation and subject to the penalty contained in this chapter.

1252.07 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Conditional use permits shall be required for types of uses designated as
conditionally permitted in a particular use district. Such particular use may
be permitted and desirable in certain districts, but not without consideration
in each case of the effect of the use upon neighboring land and the effect the
neighboring land will have on the use. The application of the planning
standards for determining the location and extent of such use is a planning
function, and not in the nature of a variance or appeal. Conditional use
permits shall run with the land and not the applicant/owner.
   (a)   Conditional Use Process.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may hear and decide upon applications for a
conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.
      (2)   In considering an application for a conditional use permit, the
Planning Commission must make an affirmative finding that the proposed
conditional use is to be located in a district wherein such use may be
conditionally permitted, and that all conditions for approval of conditional
uses have been met. The Planning Commission shall give due regard to the nature
and condition of all adjacent uses and structures and the consistency therewith
of the proposed conditional use and any potential nuisances.
      (3)   No public hearing need be held by the Planning Commission in
considering an application for a conditional use permit, except when the
Commission deems such public hearing to be necessary in the public interest.
Notice shall be given not less than ten days prior to the date of public
hearing, both by posting notice on the parcel of land involved, at places which
will be conspicuous to the neighboring properties and to the public, and by
publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation.
   (b)   Conditional Use Application. An application for a conditional use
permit shall contain the following information:
      (1)   Completion of the required application form and required fee.
      (2)   The total area in the development in square feet and acres.
      (3)   The existing zoning of the property in question and all abutting
properties.
      (4)   All right-of-way and any easement lines located on or adjacent to
the property which is proposed to be continued, created, relocated or
abandoned.
      (5)   Existing topography with a maximum of ten foot contour intervals.
      (6)   The proposed finished grade of the development shown by contours
not larger than five feet.
      (7)   The locations of all existing and proposed buildings in the
described parcels, the uses to be contained therein and the total number of
buildings including dimensions, heights, gross floor area and number of
stories.
      (8)   Location and dimension of all curb cuts, driving lanes, off-street
parking and loading areas including the number of spaces, angles of stalls,
grades, surfacing materials, drainage plans, and illumination of facilities.

orientation of all signs.
      (13)   Location of all existing and proposed streets, highways and
alleys.
      (14)   All existing and proposed water and sanitary sewer lines
indicating pipe sizes, types and grades.
      (15)   The schedule of phasing of the project, if applicable.
      (16)   Proposed plans for the exterior of the building, including
building elevations, photographs and proposed finishes or materials.
      (17)   A statement and supporting documentation describing how the
applicant believes that the request conforms to the standards for conditional
uses listed in Section 1254.08(c).
      (18)   Such other information as required by the Planning Commission to
determine the conformance with this Code.
   (c)   Standards for Conditional Use. The Planning Commission shall not grant
a conditional use unless it shall, in each specific case, make specific written
findings of fact directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it,
that support conclusions that:
      (1)   The proposed conditional use is a permitted use and will comply
with all applicable regulations of this Code, including lot size requirements,
development standards and use limitations.
      (2)   Adequate utility, drainage and other such necessary facilities have
been or will be provided.
      (3)   Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided
and will be so designed as to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic
conflicts and congestion to public streets and alleys.
      (4)   All necessary permits, and licenses for the use and operation of
the conditional use have been obtained, or evidence has been submitted that
such permits and licenses are obtainable for the proposed conditional use on
the subject property.
      (5)   All exterior lights for artificial open-air illuminations are so
shaded as to avoid casting direct light upon any property located in a
residential district and to prevent glare that may cause a nuisance to the
public.
      (6)   The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and
intensity of the operation involved or conducted in connection with it, the
size of the site in relation to it, and the location of the site with respect
to streets given access to it, shall be such that it will be in harmony with
the appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is located.
      (7)   The location, nature, and height of buildings, structures, walls,
and fences on the site and the nature and extent of landscaping and screening
on the site shall be such that the use will not unreasonably hinder or
discourage the appropriate development, use and enjoyment of adjacent land,
buildings and structures.
      (8)   Evidence that the conditional use desired will not adversely affect
the public health and safety.
   (d)   Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a conditional use permit, the
Planning Commission may impose such conditions, safeguards and restrictions
upon the premises benefitted by the conditional use as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set out in this chapter to reduce or minimize
potentially injurious affects of such conditional uses upon other property in
the neighborhood, and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this Code.
   (e)   Period of Validity. A conditional use permit granted by the Planning
Commission may terminate at the end of one year from the date on which the
Planning Commission grants the conditional use if within a one year period a
building permit or conditional use certificate is not obtained, the proposed
erection or alteration of a structure has not started, or the conditional use
as approved has not commenced.

1254.06 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide,
in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Code, applications, filed as
hereinbefore provided, for special exceptions or interpretation of the Zoning
Map, or for decisions upon other special questions on which the Board is

involve the erection of a substantial structure. A zoning certificate for such
use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit, subject
to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and
general welfare.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1254.07 INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ZONING MAP.

specific cases, filed as hereinbefore provided, such variances from the
provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the
public interest, but only in such cases where, owing to special conditions
pertaining to a specific piece of property, the literal enforcement of the
provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code would cause undue and
unnecessary hardship.
      (2)   Where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
unusual shape of a specific piece of property on the effective date of this
Zoning Code, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use
or development of property immediately adjoining the piece of property in
question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this Zoning Code would
involve practical difficulties or would cause undue hardship, unnecessary to
carry out the spirit and purpose of this Zoning Code, the Board shall have
power to authorize a variance from such strict application, so as to relieve
such hardship, and so that the spirit and purpose of this Zoning Code shall be
observed and substantial justice done. In authorizing a variance, the Board may
attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other
features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the
interest of furthering the purposes of this Zoning Code and in the public
interest. In authorizing a variance, with attached conditions, the Board shall
require such evidence, guarantee or bond as it may deem necessary to ensure
that the conditions attached are being and will be complied with.
      (3)   No such variance from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning
Code shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that all of the following facts and conditions exist:
         A.   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applying to the property in question, or to the intended use of the
property, that do not apply generally to other properties or classes of uses in
the same zoning district.
         B.   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the
same zoning district and in the same vicinity.
         C.   That the authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair the purposes of
this Zoning Code or the public interest.
         D.   No grant of a variance shall be authorized unless the Board
specifically finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of
property, or the intended use of said property for which the variance is
sought, one or the other or in combination, is not of so general or recurrent a
nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation for such condition or situation.
      (4)   Every variance granted or denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact, based on testimony and
evidence and specifying the reason for granting or denying the variance.
      (5)   Any variance granted but not acted upon within one year shall be
cancelled.
      (6)   Any party adversely affected by a decision of the Board may appeal
to the County Court of Common Pleas on the grounds that such decision was
unreasonable or unlawful. The Court may affirm, reverse, vacate or modify the
decision complained of in the appeal.
      (7)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of the variance, give ten days notice by first class mail to the
parties in interest as well as to all property owners within 250 feet of the
subject property.
      (8)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall decide the variance within 30
days after the hearing. This time period may be extended for a period not to
exceed 30 days if agreed to by the Board of Zoning Appeals and the applicant.

recommendation thereon from the Planning Commission, and subject to the
procedure provided by law, amend, supplement or change these regulations,
district boundaries or classifications or property, now or hereafter
established by this Zoning Code or any amendment thereof. It shall be the duty
of the Planning Commission to submit its recommendations regarding all
applications or proposals for text or map amendments or supplements to City
Council.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 5-7-10.)

   Amendments to the zoning map or text may be initiated in one of the
following ways:
   (a)   By adoption of a motion by the Planning Commission;
   (b)   By adoption of a motion by Council for consideration by the Planning
Commission; and
   (c)   By application to the Planning Commission by a property owner of
record.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 5-7-10.)
1256.03 PROCEDURE.
   The procedure for amendments to the Official Zoning Map or text of this
Zoning Code shall be as follows:
   (a)   Applications. Applications for any text amendment or change of
district boundaries or classifications of property, as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission at its public office.
Applications shall be on a form as approved by the City and shall be
accompanied by such data and information, as may be prescribed for that purpose
by the Planning Commission, so as to assure the fullest practicable
presentation of facts for the permanent record. Each such application for a map
amendment shall be verified by at least one of the property owners of record
within the area proposed to be rezoned, attesting to the truth and correctness
of all facts and information presented with the application. Applications for
map or text amendments initiated by the Planning Commission shall be
accompanied by the motion pertaining to the proposed amendment.
   (b)   Names and Addresses of Adjacent Property Owners. Any owner of record
desiring a change in the zoning classification of their property shall file,
with the application for such change, a statement giving the names and
addresses of the owners of all properties lying within 200 feet of any part of
the property the zoning classification of which is proposed to be changed.
   (c)   Public Hearing by Planning Commission. Before submitting its
recommendations on a proposed amendment to the City Council, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be given
by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least
30 days prior to the meeting date. The notice shall state the place or places
and times at which the proposed amendment, including texts and maps, may be
examined.
   (d)   Notice to Property Owners. In addition to the published notice as
hereinbefore specified, the Planning Commission shall give notice of the time,
place and purpose of public hearings to be held by it on proposed amendments or
supplements, by mailing a postal card or letter notice, not less than ten days
prior to the date of the hearing, to the owners of all properties lying within
200 feet of any part of the property proposed to be changed. The failure to
notify as provided in this section shall not invalidate any recommendation
adopted hereunder, it being the intention of this section to provide, so far as
may be possible, due notice to persons substantially interested in the proposed
change that an application is pending before the Planning Commission, proposing
to make a change in the Zoning Map or the regulations set forth in this Zoning
Code.
   (e)   Action of Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may recommend
that the application be granted as requested, or it may recommend a
modification of the zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may
recommend that the application be denied. These recommendations shall then be
certified to the City Council.
   (f)   Public Hearing by City Council. After receiving the recommendation
from the Planning Commission on the proposed amendment, and before adoption of
such amendment, the City Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, at least
30 days notice of the time and place of which shall be given by one publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
   (g)   Action of City Council. After receiving the recommendation from the
Planning Commission on the proposed amendment and after holding the public
hearing as identified in Section
1256.02, the City Council shall consider such recommendations and vote on the
passage of the proposed amendment to the text of the Zoning Code or on the
Zoning Map. The City Council may overrule the recommendations of the Commission
by a three-fourths vote of the full membership of the Council.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 5-7-10.)
1256.04 FEE.
   At the time that an application for a change of zoning districts is filed
with the Planning Commission, as provided herein, there shall be deposited with
the City Treasurer a fee in an amount determined by ordinance of Council, to
cover an investigation, legal notices and other expenses incidental to the
determination of the proposed amendment(s), such fee to be for one lot or part
of one lot. Such sum so deposited shall be credited by the City Treasurer to
the General Fund of the City. Application for a change of zoning districts
shall be for one contiguous area. There shall be no refunds or credits
regardless of approval or disapproval by either the Planning Commission or City
Council, or if the proceedings are dropped any time after the application is
filed with the City Planning Commission.

1283.13   Filing fees.
1283.01 INTENT.
   It is the purpose of the Planned Unit Development District to permit an
applicant, through consultation with the Planning Commission and Council, to
develop a site according to a plan which may supersede normal zoning
requirements of a particular zoning district(s). The uses approved within a
planned unit development must conform to the uses as specified in the current
Zoning Code. Planned unit developments would permit more creative site planning
through design and mix of uses that may not be normally possible under typical
zoning and permit a developer to incorporate such amenities as common open
space into the overall site design. The Council may approve planned unit
development (PUD) zoning based on the regulations, guidelines and procedures in
this chapter.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1283.02 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
   (a)   The owner or owners of any tract of land comprising an area of not
less than five acres may submit to the Planning Commission a plan for the use
and development of entire tract of land for residential and non-residential
purposes based on the requirements and procedures of this chapter. The
development plan shall be studied and reviewed and a public hearing shall be
held. Notice and publication of such public hearing shall conform to the
procedures prescribed in
Chapter 1256 for hearings on changes and amendments.
   (b)   A planned unit development may be considered provided that the use(s)
approved in the plan complies with those uses identified as permitted or
conditionally permitted within the current Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1283.03 REQUIRED OPEN SPACE.
   Open space shall be required in a planned unit development based on the
following:
   (a)   A minimum land area of 20% of the overall tract for use as common open
space shall be reserved. If the open space is proposed to be in more than one
area in the planned unit development, it shall be interconnected by walkways,
paths or greenbelts.
   (b)   This open space may include such areas as: pedestrian walkways,
parkland, woodland, open field areas, clubhouse, drainage ways, greenbelts,
rain gardens and other lands of essentially open character which permits
natural preservation, active or passive recreational pursuits. Preferred open
space includes: woodland, stream corridors and other naturally preserved areas.
Private yards on individual lots shall not be considered permissible as open
space.
   (c)   Ownership of this common open space shall be transferred to a legally
established homeowners association, or deeded with permanent restrictions for
its preservation, or other method agreed upon by the City, and the proper legal
documents necessary for such transfer be prepared by the owner(s).
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1283.04 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
   The following procedures shall be followed in applying for rezoning to a
Planned Unit Development District:
   (a)   Application Submission. An applicant shall submit a complete
application requesting that the Zoning District Map be amended to rezone the
subject property as a planned unit development (PUD). Such applications shall
be processed, noticed, and heard in a manner prescribed in this chapter and
Chapter 1256.
   (b)   Informal Consultation. Applicants are encouraged to engage in informal
consultations with City staff prior to preparing any plans. No statement or
representation by staff, however, shall be binding.
   (c)   Concept Plan. Concept plan contents are established in Section
1283.05.
   (d)   Preliminary and Final Development Plan.
      An applicant may submit a preliminary development plan, and subsequently
submit a final development plan, for any or all portion of the approved
preliminary development plan that the applicant wishes to develop. The
applicant may also submit a combined preliminary and final development plan as
identified in Section
1283.09.
      The Planning Commission or Council may determine that the review of the
planned unit development submission requires the assistance of engineers,
architects, planners or attorneys to assist in its evaluation of the
preliminary or final development plan. In such event, the Planning Commission
or Council may require that the applicant pay the fees of such persons so
retained to assist the City, Planning Commission or Council. By the submission
of an application for preliminary or final development plan approval, the
applicant agrees to pay such fees.
   (e)   Zoning Certificate. No zoning certificate shall be issued for any
property for which a rezoning is requested and no construction shall begin
until the final development plan is approved as per the requirements in this
chapter.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1283.05 REQUIRED CONTENTS OF THE CONCEPT PLAN.

surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved
under other zoning districts in these regulations.
   (c)   That the internal streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and
adequate to carry anticipated traffic.
   (d)   That the minimum open space area has been reserved, a means has been
established to maintain the area, and is either to be dedicated to the City, be
transferred to a legally established homeowner's association or other legally
established entity, or other mechanism approved by the City.
   (e)   That any part of a planned unit development not used for structures,
parking and loading areas or streets shall be landscaped or otherwise improved.
   (f)   That the planned unit development is in conformance with the City
Comprehensive Plan, as adopted at the time the application is being heard.

1283.11 AMENDMENTS TO AN APPROVED PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   An approved planned unit development concept plan, preliminary or final
development plan may be amended by following the procedures described in this
chapter. However, minor adjustments in the preliminary or final development
plans which become necessary because of field conditions, detailed engineering
data, topography or critical design criteria pertaining to drives, curb cuts,
retaining walls, swimming pools, tennis courts, fences, building locations and
building configurations, parking area locations or other similar project
particulars, may be authorized in writing by the Planning Commission. These
minor adjustments may be permitted, provided that they do not increase density,
decrease the number of parking spaces or allow buildings closer to residential
property lines. Changes determined to be major shall require review and
approval by the City Council.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1283.12 REVOCATION.
   In the event of a failure to comply with the approved final development plan
or any condition of approval, including, but not limited to, failure to comply
with the staged development schedule, the Zoning Administrative Official may,
after notice, rescind, and revoke such plan approval. Violation of the final
approval of the final development plan for a planned unit development shall
constitute violation of the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1283.13 FILING FEES.

1284.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to prevent or alleviate the congestion of the
public street, to minimize any detrimental effects of parking lots on adjacent
properties, to enhance lots with landscape elements for improved traffic
circulation and visual amenities and to promote the safety and welfare of the
public. To accomplish this purpose minimum requirements are established, while
more landscaping may be included depending on site specific conditions.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1284.02 OFF-STREET PARKING APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Except in the B-3 District, all buildings and structures erected and
all uses of land established after the adoption of this Zoning Code shall be
provided with off-street parking and loading spaces as set forth in this
section.
   (b)   The provisions of this section, except where there is change or
enlargement of use, shall not apply to any existing building or structure.
   (c)   Whenever a building or structure constructed before the effective date
of this Zoning Code is changed or enlarged, in floor area, number of employees,
number of housing units, seating capacity, or otherwise, to create a need for
an increase in the number of parking spaces, additional parking spaces shall be
provided on the basis of the enlargement or change, provided that whenever a
building or structure existing prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code
is enlarged to the extent of 50% or more in floor area, number of employees,
number of housing units, seating capacity, or otherwise, said building or
structure shall then and thereafter comply with the full parking requirements
set forth herein.
   (d)   Accessory off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective
date of this Zoning Code, and located on the same lot as the building or use
served, shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than, shall
not be further reduced below, the requirements for a similar new building or
use under the provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1284.03 OFF-STREET PARKING MAINTENANCE.
   The duty to maintain all off-street parking areas shall be the joint
responsibilities of the owner, operator and lessee of the use for where parking
lots are required. Off-street parking areas shall be maintained in good
condition without holes and free of all trash, abandoned or junk vehicles,
weeds and other rubbish.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1284.04 OFF-STREET PARKING PLAN REVIEW.
   For any off-street parking area required under this chapter, a plan shall be
submitted with the application for a zoning certificate to the Zoning
Administrative Officer to review for compliance with these regulations and for
any other applicable regulations. Any such parking plan shall show the number
of parking spaces, the arrangement of parking aisles, the location of driveway
entrances, provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, the location or
typical location of sidewalks, wheel stops, lighting and curbs on or adjacent
to the property, the location of utilities, barriers, shelters, and signs, the
location of landscaped areas and the types and location of vegetation to be
planted in them, typical cross sections of pavement, storm water drainage
facilities, and any other relevant information requested by the Zoning
Administrative Officer.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1284.05 OFF-STREET PARKING LOCATION AND USAGE.
   The following regulations shall govern the location of off-street parking
spaces and areas.
   (a)   Parking spaces for all detached residential uses shall be located on
the same lot as the use which they are intended to serve.
   (b)   Parking spaces for commercial, industrial, public or institutional
uses shall be located not more than 700 feet from the principal use. Parking
lots farther than 700 feet from the principal use shall be subject to approval
by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Parking spaces for apartments or similar residential uses shall be
located not more than 300 feet from the principal building.
   (d)   When two or more uses are located within the same building or
structure, off-street parking spaces equal in number to the sum of the separate
requirements for each use shall be provided.
   (e)   All off-street parking spaces required by this chapter shall be used
only for the parking of vehicles of occupants, patrons, visitors or employees
and shall not be used for any kind of loading, sales, servicing or continuous
storage of a vehicle for more than 48 hours.
   (f)   Off-street parking spaces may be located in any yard except the
required front yard of the M-1 District.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1284.06 OFF-STREET PARKING DESIGN.
   Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public or private off-street
parking area, which is required to accommodate five or more vehicles, shall be
developed and maintained in accordance with the following requirements:
   (a)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall have direct
access to an aisle or driveway and all required off-street parking areas shall
have vehicular access to a street or alley so designed to minimize interference
with pedestrian and traffic movement.
   (b)   Pavement and Drainage.
      In all R and B districts, all required off-street parking shall be paved
with bituminous, concrete or other all-weather, dustproof surfacing and shall
be provided with bumper guards or barrier curbs where needed to prevent
encroachment onto sidewalks or into landscaped or areas used for screening.
      No surface water from parking areas shall accumulate or drain over a
public sidewalk. Interior landscaped areas may be used for surface drainage.
The use of pervious asphalt or pavers for non-residential use is encouraged to
prevent surface water runoff. Pervious asphalt or pavers for non-residential
use shall be approved by the Planning Commission prior to installation.
   (c)   Lighting. Fixed lighting shall comply with the provisions contained
below and be so arranged to prevent direct glare of beams onto any public or
private property or street. The following restrictions shall apply to any
outdoor lighting located in any district or parcels where there are non-
residential off-street parking spaces.
      (1)   Lighting plan required. A lighting plan is required for any off-
street parking and loading area lighting. The following information shall be
submitted, as a minimum, in order to effectively evaluate the proposed
lighting:
         A.   Pole height or mounting height of lighting fixture;
         B.   Type of luminaries;
         C.   Site coverage;
         D.   Uniformity including the maximum, average and minimum
footcandles;
         E.   Intensity at property line in footcandles.
      (2)   Height of lighting structure. All outdoor lighting shall be
designed, located, and mounted at heights no greater than 20 feet. A greater
height may be authorized in any district by a variance approved pursuant to
Chapter 1254. Cutoff and non-cutoff lights are illustrated below:

IMAGES/0-0-0-8651.gif]
 
      (3)   Illumination. All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located
with a maximum illumination of 1.0 footcandles as measured at the property
line.
      (4)   Shielding. All outdoor lighting for non-residential uses shall be
located, screened, or shielded so that adjacent lots located in residential
districts are not directly illuminated.
      (5)   Color and glare. No outdoor lighting shall be of such an intensity
or color distortion as to cause glare or to impair the vision of drivers or
pedestrians.
   (d)   Screening. All open off-street parking areas shall be effectively
screened on each side adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a
residential district, or any institutional premises, by a wall, fence or
densely planted compact hedge, not less than five feet nor more than eight feet
in height.
   (e)   Parking Space Dimension.
      A parking space shall have minimum rectangular dimensions of not less
than:
      (1)   Ten feet in width and twenty feet in length for 90 degree parking,
      (2)   Ten feet in width and 23 feet in length for parallel parking, and
      (3)   Ten feet in width and 20 feet in length for 45 degree parking.
      All dimensions shall be exclusive of driveways, aisles, and other
circulation areas.
   (f)   Driveway Dimension.
      Driveways (aisles) serving individual parking spaces shall not be less
than:
      (1)   Twenty-five feet wide for 90 degree parking,
      (2)   Twelve feet wide for parallel parking,
      (3)   Seventeen and one-half feet for 60 degree parking, and
      (4)   Thirteen feet for 45 degree parking.
      These dimensions do not include any parking spaces.
   (g)   Joint Use. Two or more non-residential uses may jointly provide and
use parking spaces when their hours of operation do not normally overlap,
provided that a written agreement approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
be filed with the application for a permit.
   (h)   Collective Use. The required off-street parking spaces for any number
of separate buildings, structures or uses may be provided collectively on one
lot, provided the total number of such spaces shall not be less than the sum of
the requirements for the various individual buildings, structures or uses
computed separately in accordance with the following requirements.
   (i)   Spaces for the Handicapped. Parking spaces for handicapped individuals
shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Basic Building
Code and the Ohio Revised Code.
   (j)   Maximum Number of Parking Spaces Permitted. In order to prevent
excessive lot coverage, the artificial increase in air temperature, and surface
water run-off, no minimum off-street parking space requirement in Section
1284.08, shall be exceeded by more than 15% unless good cause can be shown by
the applicant and approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Single-family
dwellings and two family dwellings are exempt from this provision.
   (k)   Parking of Inoperable or Abandoned Vehicles. The parking or storage of
inoperable or abandoned vehicles is prohibited outdoors in all districts and as
further provided herein. The location and duration or temporary parking or
storage of an unlicensed operable vehicle may be approved by the Zoning
Administrative Officer through the issuance of a temporary zoning certificate
on the basis of the adequacy of the parcel size, condition of the vehicle,
visibility from other properties and absence of undue adverse impact on
adjacent property or on the area as a whole.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1284.07 OFF-STREET PARKING MEASUREMENT FOR NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES.
   Except as otherwise provided in this section, off-street parking spaces for
each new principal use on a lot shall be provided according to the units of
measurement indicated for that use in Section
1294.08. The following provision shall govern the computation of the number of
off-street parking spaces required:
   (a)   Fractions. When determination of the number of required parking spaces
results in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction one-half or less
shall be disregarded and any fraction over one-half shall require one parking
space.
   (b)   Bench Seating Calculation. In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and
other places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or
other similar seating facilities, each 24 inches of such seating facilities
shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for
off-street parking facilities.
   (c)   Use of "Maximum". When parking spaces are required on the basis of the
number of faculty, staff, students or employees, the maximum number present at
any one time shall govern. The "maximum number" shall be the same as the
"maximum occupancy" as identified on the building permit or as identified by
the Fire Chief.
   (d)   Interpretation. For uses not expressly listed in Section
1284.08, parking spaces shall be provided on the same basis as required for the
most similar and restrictive listed use as determined by the Zoning
Administrative Officer for that specific use based on the intended use, the
location of such use and the expected patronage by individuals operating motor
vehicles.
   (e)   Floor Area Defined. For the purposes of applying "floor area", floor
area shall be the sum of the gross leasable horizontal area of all floors of a
building.

   (b)   Maintain and enhance the City's natural and manmade environment;
   (c)   Encourage a safe, attractive and healthy economic environment;
   (d)   Minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and
private property; and
   (e)   Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations.
   The purpose as stated above is based on the following findings concerning
signs:
   (a)   That excessive signs can create dangerous traffic conditions and, as
such, are detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare of the
City.
   (b)   That businesses and other institutions located along public and
private streets have a need to identify themselves and their activities to
motorists and pedestrians by means of signs.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1286.02 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   No sign shall be permitted in any district except as specifically provided
in this chapter.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)

   (a)   Except as provided in this section, no sign shall be placed in any
public right-of- way, except publicly owned signs, such as traffic control
signs and directional signs and no sign shall be posted on any public utility
poles, on any park trees or street trees as defined by Section
1028.01 of the Codified Ordinances, or to any publicly owned sign posts or
hydrants.
   (b)   Temporary signs not exceeding 50 square feet in area, announcing
special public or institutional events, the erection of a building, the

displayed more than five days and must have the dates for the sale clearly
marked.
   (d)   Realty directional arrows and open house signs are permitted in the
City right-of-way if the realty business obtains an annual permit to place such
signs. This type of sign must be placed as near as possible to existing City
sign posts so no additional maintenance to the area of the sign is required.
The fee for such a permit is established by ordinance by City Council, per
year, and can be obtained at the City Engineering Department.
   (e)   At a business property where the City right-of-way adjoins the front
of a building, the business may place a sandwich board type sign or any self-
standing signs (referred to as ground sign boards in other ordinances) for the
purpose of daily advertising. The sign may be no larger than four feet in
height and two feet in width. Such a sign may be placed on the sidewalk in
front of the business' building during business hours and must be placed so
that the sign does not restrict pedestrian traffic. The business accepts all
liability of the sign. A permit is required for each such sign. The fee for
such a permit is $25.00 per year and can be obtained at the City Engineering
Department.
   (f)   Signs shall not be illuminated in any manner which causes undue
distraction, confusion or hazard to vehicular traffic.
   (g)   Lighting used to illuminate a sign shall be shielded from residential

   (d)   The height of a sign shall be determined by measuring the vertical
distance between the top part of the sign to the elevation of the ground
beneath the sign prior to construction, excluding additional elevation added by
creation of berming or mounding. If the grade prior to construction cannot be
determined, the elevation of the base of the sign shall be computed using the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of
the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the premises,
whichever is lower.

Code may be continued, even though such use does not conform to the provisions
hereof. If a nonconforming building is changed to another use, the building
shall fall under the requirements of the most recent City adopted Building
Code. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or
to a conforming use under the requirements of the most recent City adopted
Building Code, such use shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming
use. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those parts

Zoning Code, the construction of which has been started at the time of the
passage of a change to this Zoning Code, but not completed, may be completed
and put into such use under which it was approved, provided it is done within
one year after the Zoning Code change takes effect.
   (d)   A nonconforming building which has been damaged by fire, explosion,
act of God or the public enemy, to the extent of more than 60% of its
reproduction value at the time of damage, shall not be restored except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. When
damaged by less than 60% of its reproduction value, a nonconforming building
may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage,
provided such repairs or reconstruction are completed within one year of the
date of such damage.

screening purposes, additional materials listed in this chapter must be used to
create a dense buffer.
         B.   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet
in height at the time of planting when used for screening purposes when
adjacent to a residential district. Evergreen plantings used for screening
shall be planted so as to provide an effective, dense screen upon the time of
planting. The height at installation of the planting shall be measured from the
level of the planting surface of the evergreen base.
         C.   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least five feet
in height at the time of planting. All shrubs and hedges shall be designed to
provide an effective, dense screen and mature height of at least six feet
within two years after the date of the final approval of each planting. The
height at installation of the planting shall be measured from the level of the
surface of the plant base at the edge closest to the screening.
         D.   Grass or ground cover. Grass shall be appropriate for the soil
type. In swales or other areas subject to erosion, solid sod, erosion reducing
net or suitable mulch shall be used and nursegrass seed shall be sown for
immediate protection until complete coverage otherwise is achieved and shall be
reviewed by the Auglaize Soil and Water Conservation District. Grass sod shall
be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Ground cover shall be
planted to provide 75% complete coverage after two growing seasons.
      (3)   Mounds. Mounds made of soil may be used for screening purposes. A
difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not constitute
an earth mound. Mounds shall conform to the following standards:
         A.   The maximum side slope shall be three horizontal to one vertical
(3:1) and the design shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrative Officer to
ensure that proper erosion prevention and control practices have been utilized.
         B.   Berms and earth forms shall be designed with physical variations
in height and alignment throughout their length.
         C.   Landscape plant material installed on berms and earth forms shall
be arranged in an irregular pattern to accentuate the physical variation and
achieve a natural appearance.
         D.   The plan shall show sufficient detail, including a plan and
profile of the berm or earth form, soil types and construction techniques to
demonstrate compliance with the above provisions.
         E.   Berms and earth forms shall be located and designed to minimize
the disturbance to existing trees located on the site or adjacent thereto.
         F.   For adequate sight distance for points of ingress and egress, no
part of any berm which is elevated more than 36 inches above natural grade
shall be located within 20 feet of any right-of-way or property line.
         G.   Adequate ground cover shall be used and maintained to prevent
erosion of the mound.

(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1294.08 EASEMENTS, RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND SETBACKS.
   Required screening and landscaping may be placed wholly or partially in
utility or other easements providing all requirements of this chapter can be
fulfilled and approval is granted by the holder of the easements, in writing.
   In no case, however, shall screening or landscaping be established so as to
block the sight distance at street or drive intersections. Ground cover and
trees with at least six feet of limbless trunk shall be permitted within the
sight distance triangle. In the case of a street intersection, the sight
triangle shall consist of the area between points 20 feet along both
intersecting streets from their respective edge of pavements.
(Ord. 2010-29. Passed 7-5-10.)
1294.09 MODIFICATIONS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to modify or waive any
of the aforementioned requirements in this chapter in considering an individual
site with respect to changes in elevation, environmental impact, durability of

1420.01 2005 EDITION ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted, by and for the
Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC), being particularly the 2005 edition
and all future revisions and supplements to such code, as adopted by the Ohio
Board of Building Standards, Department of Industrial Relations, and as
published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), save and
except such portions thereof as may be hereinafter amended or deleted.
(Ord. 2007-37. Passed 9-17-07.)
1420.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the OBC, as adopted in Section
1420.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.
(OAC 4101:2-1-05) (Ord. 2007-37. Passed 9-17-07.)

1476.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.02 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
   (h)   Ensure that persons who occupy an area of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.04 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. As used in this

gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (q)   "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is
started, or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not such alteration affects the external

National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
   (r)   "Variance" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of
this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.05 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.06 AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
"Flood Insurance Study for the City of Wapakoneta." This study, with
accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
dated September 6, 1989, and any revision thereto, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. Such Study is on file at
102 Perry Street.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.07 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit, as stated
in Section
1476.11(b), no structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with this chapter and all other applicable regulations which apply
to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.08 CONFLICTS WITH EASEMENT, COVENANT OR DEED RESTRICTIONS AND ORDINANCES.

statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is in conflict with a State law,
such State law shall take precedence.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made under this chapter.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.11 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   A development permit shall be obtained before construction or
development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in
Section
1476.06. An application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Director of Public Service and Safety and may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the locations
thereof. Specifically, the following information is required:
      (1)   The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor,
including the basement, of all proposed structures;
      (2)   The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed;

that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1476.16 (b); and
      (4)   A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
    (b)   An application for a development permit is not required for
maintenance work such as roofing, painting and basement sealing, or for small
development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000).
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.12 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Director of Public Service and Safety is hereby appointed to administer
and implement this chapter by granting or denying a development permit
application in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.13 DUTIES OF DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND SAFETY.
   The duties of the Director of Public Service and Safety under this chapter
include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (a)   Permit Review. The Director of Public Service and Safety shall:
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
      (2)   Review all development permits to ensure that all necessary permits
have been obtained from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required. The applicant is responsible for
obtaining such permits as required.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of
flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall ensure that the
encroachment provisions of Section
1476.17(a) are met.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Data. Areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data have not been provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood
      Insurance Rate Map. Within these areas, the Director of Public Service
and Safety shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation
and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source in order to
administer Sections
1476.16(a) and (b) and
1476.17.
   (c)   Information to be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary Map), regardless of the source of
such data:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and state whether or not such structures contain a
basement;
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, to which the structure was floodproofed; and
         B.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1476.11(a)(3); and
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to this
chapter.
   (d)   Alteration of Watercourses. The Director of Public Service and Safety
shall:
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
      (2)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for by the
applicant, for the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse, so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. The Director of Public Service and
Safety shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions). Where a map boundary and elevations disagree, the elevations
delineated in the flood elevation profile shall prevail. The person contesting
the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal
the interpretation as provided in Section
1476.14.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.14 APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   (a)   Procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination
made by the Director of Public Service and Safety in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Persons aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Auglaize County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property, in times of flood, for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (a)(4)
hereof, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
      (6)   The Director of Public Service and Safety shall maintain the
records of all appeal actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
    (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, a variance may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   A variance may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
      (3)   A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   A variance shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   A variance shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create
nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public, as identified in
paragraph (a)(4) hereof; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 89-33. Passed 9-6-89.)
1476.15 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
   (a)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods

      (3)   Immediately proceed west a distance of approximately 20 feet.
      (4)   Proceed north until reaching the south bank of the Auglaize River.
      (5)   Then proceeding west along the river's edge to the centerline of
Blackhoof Street.
      (6)   Then proceeding south to the centerline of the east-west alley
midway between Auglaize Street and Main Street (that is, including properties
on the east side of Blackhoof Street only).
      (7)   Continue east along the centerline of this alley to the centerline
of Perry Street.
      (8)   Proceeding south along the centerline of Perry Street (that is,

(Ord. 2017-13R. Passed 5-1-17; Ord. 2024-38. Passed 10-7-24.)
1480.05 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   The Design Review Board shall annually select one of its members to
serve as chairperson and one as vice chairperson. The Safety Service Director
shall provide such staff assistance as is necessary and available. All
municipal departments and agencies shall cooperate in expediting the work of
the Design Review Board.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall adopt rules and regulations, consistent
with this chapter, governing its procedures and transactions. The Design Review
Board shall meet as required to carry out the review of applications for
certificates of appropriateness, and such other related work as may be accepted
through request of Council or undertaken on its own motion. Meeting shall be
held at least once each month when there are applications to be considered and
not less than once a year. Special meetings may be held at the call of the
Mayor or chairperson of the Design Review Board.
   (c)   Within the boundaries of the preservation district, and other areas as
delineated in this chapter, the Design Review Board shall review any proposed
new construction and alterations to property as herein defined. The Board's
approval of such new construction and alteration shall be secured before any
owner of property may commence work thereon. In reviewing proposed alterations
to property, the Design Review Board shall at a minimum use as evaluative
criteria, the ten federal standards established by the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of the Interior as follows:
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property, which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure,
or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes, which may have taken place in its course of time, are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment. These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship, which characterize building, structure, or site, shall be
treated with sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, should be substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other building or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to, any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment.
      (10)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   (d)   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the U.S. Secretary of The
Interior Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings in their review and
deliberation.
   (e)   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design
review criteria with Council approval based on the preservation district
predominant architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/
archaeological attributes.
(Ord. 2017-13R. Passed 5-1-17.)
1480.06 TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR DESIGN REVIEW.
   Once a property owner applies for a building permit for an alteration within
the preservation district, the permit application will be deemed as an
application to the Design Review Board. All property owners within the
preservation district must receive Design Review Board approval prior to
building permit issuance.
(Ord. 2017-13R. Passed 5-1-17.)
1480.07 ALTERATIONS.
   No alteration of any structure of significant exterior architectural feature
thereof in any designated preservation district shall be undertaken prior to
obtaining a zoning certificate from the City Engineering Department and a
building permit from the State of Ohio. The building permit and zoning
certificate must be obtained before submitting to the Design Review Board.
(Ord. 2017-13R. Passed 5-1-17.)
1480.08 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a preservation district proposes
new construction or alteration to any portion of a structure within the
district he or she shall first apply for and secure a certificate of
appropriateness from the Design Review Board. The application for a certificate
shall be made with the Building Official, together with such plans,
specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board may from time to
time prescribe.
   (b)   Within forty-five days of filing, the Design Review Board shall
consider the applications, plans, and specifications.
   (c)   If the proposed alteration is determined to have no adverse effect by
the Design Review Board on the preservation district, and does not violate the
spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board Secretary shall issue
the certificate of appropriateness.
   (d)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alteration
will have an adverse effect on the preservation district, and does violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the certificate of appropriateness.
   (e)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the forty-
five day review period that a certificate of appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object, or work of art. The Secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Engineering Department of such
determination and transmit to him/her a certified copy of the reasons for
denial and recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (f)   Upon denying a certificate of appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty days, but not to exceed six months from the
date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with the owner
of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to both.
The first meeting between Board and applicant shall be held within thirty days
from the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal is accepted by both
parties, the Board may henceforth issue a certificate of appropriateness.
   (g)   In the case of denial of a certificate of appropriateness for
demolition:
      (1)   The Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property. The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property. If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and such good faith
meetings shall be held at least every forty-five days after the initial
meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the
time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness for such.
       (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction, or alteration is reached then the applicant may appeal the
decision.
(Ord. 2017-13R. Passed 5-1-17.)
1480.09 APPEALS.
   (a)   Decisions by the Design Review Board may be appealed in writing by the
applicant within seven business days of the Design Review Board's decision.
   (b)   City Council shall consider an appeal at a public hearing within
thirty days of receipt of notice of appeal, and shall utilize the written
finding of the Design Review Board.
   (c)   A majority vote of the City Council shall be required to overturn a
decision of the Design Review Board.
   (d)   Decisions by City Council shall be deemed final administrative orders
for appellate purposes and shall be thereafter regulated by R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2017-13R. Passed 5-1-17.)
1480.10 PENALTIES.
   Whoever constructs, reconstructs, alters, changes, or demolishes any
exterior feature of any structure, work of art, object, or area in violation of
this chapter or whoever maintains, changes, or installs a sign in violation of
this chapter, shall be deemed in violation of the Municipal Code and such
violation shall be punishable under Section
1440.99 of the Municipal Code. Each day of violation shall constitute a
separate and distinct violation for as long as one year with respect to
alterations and for as long as two years with respect to demolition. These
periods correspond to those during which the Board may delay a proposed
alteration or demolition.
(Ord. 2017-13R. Passed 5-1-17.)
1480.11 EXCLUSIONS.
   Normal and ordinary maintenance functions performed on buildings within the
preservation district and the removal/demolition of declared public nuisance
(e.g. fire damaged buildings) that pose a threat to the health and safety of
the general public shall be excluded from this chapter.

majority of the property frontage on both sides of the street in the block in
which the ground sign board is maintained or to be erected, constructed or
located. Such written consent shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of
any permit for such board by the City Planning Commission.
      (2)   Fireproofing sign. No person shall erect or construct any ground
sign board within the fire limits of the City which is not constructed entirely
of fireproof materials.
      (3)   Height. No ground sign board erected, constructed or maintained
within the corporate limits shall be, at any point, over twenty feet above the
ground level. However, if the sign is an illuminated one, the lighting
reflectors may project not more than six feet beyond the top edge of the board.
      (4)   Placement of Lower Edge of Sign. Every ground sign board shall be
stoutly constructed and anchored in a secure and substantial manner and shall
use one of two options in determining the placement of the lower edge of the
sign as follows:
         A.   The lower edge of the ground sign board may rest entirely upon
the ground or a base that is an integral part of the sign structure design; or
         B.   Ground sign board may have an open space of not more than 30
inches. Braces and vertical supports shall be an integral part of the ground
sign board design and not merely structural in nature
      (5)   Upkeep. Any person occupying any vacant lot or premises with a
ground board sign shall be subject to the same duties and responsibilities as
the owner of the lot or premises, with respect to keeping the same clean,
sanitary, inoffensive and free and clear of all noxious substances in the
vicinity of such board.
   (b)   Roof Sign Board.
      (1)   Projection. No roof sign board shall be placed on the roof of any
building as to prevent free passage from one part to another of the roof, or to
interfere with any openings in the roof. No sign placed upon the roof of any
building shall project beyond the edge of the roof in any direction.
      (2)   Clearance space. All roof sign boards shall be constructed to leave
a clear space of not less than six feet between the roof level and the lowest
part of the sign structure, and at least a five-foot clearance between the
vertical supports thereof.
      (3)   Setback. All roof sign boards shall be set back at least four feet
from the face of any front, rear or side wall. Lighting reflectors may project
not more than six feet beyond the building line.
      (4)   Construction. All roof sign boards shall be constructed entirely of
steel or fireproof materials, including uprights, supports and braces. All roof
signs must be constructed to withstand a wind pressure of not less than thirty
pounds to the square foot of area subject to such pressure. When erected upon
buildings not constructed entirely of fireproof materials, the bearing places
of the sign shall bear directly upon the masonry walls or steel girders which
are supported on the masonry walls and intermediate columns in the building.
      (5)   Height. No roof sign structure having a tight, closed or solid
surface shall be, at any point, over thirty-one feet above the roof level. Roof
sign structures not having a tight, closed or solid surface may be erected upon
fireproof buildings to a height not exceeding seventy-five feet above the roof
level and upon nonfireproof buildings to a height not exceeding fifty feet
above the roof level, but the portions of such structure covered and exposed to
wind pressure shall not exceed thirty-five percent of the area thereof. All
such signs shall be thoroughly secured to the building upon which they are
installed, erected or constructed, by iron or metal anchors, bolts, supports,
chains, stranded cables, steel rods or braces.
      (6)   Maintenance. Every roof sign and all the supports, braces, guys and
anchors thereof shall be kept in repair and, unless made of noncorroding
material, shall be thoroughly and properly painted at least once every two
years.
   (c)   Wall Bulletins.
      (1)   Height and other specifications. No wall bulletin shall extend more
than twelve inches beyond the building line of the building to which it is
attached, except that lighting reflectors may extend not more than six feet
beyond said building line, provided that the reflectors and supports shall, at
a distance of twelve inches from said building line, be at least twenty feet
above the street or sidewalk level at the lowest point.
      (2)   Means of attaching bulletins. All wall bulletins must be safely and
adequately attached to the building wall by means of iron or metal anchors,
bolts or expansion screws.
      (3)   Blocking exits and openings. No wall bulletin shall be erected as
to cover the doors, windows or other openings of any building, or otherwise to
prevent or hinder free ingress to and egress from any window, door or fire
escape of the building.
      (4)   Edging. The bottom edges of wall bulletins shall be:
         A.   Not less than three nor more than four feet; or
         B.   At least eighteen feet above the street or sidewalk level.
   (d)   Projecting Signs.
      (1)   Construction. Every projecting sign must be constructed and braced
to withstand a horizontal wind pressure of thirty pounds for every square foot
of surface exposed. Every projecting sign shall be securely attached to the
building wall by iron or metal anchors, bolts, supports, chains, stranded
cables or steel rods.
      (2)   Extension limits. Signs projecting from the building wall may
extend to within one foot of the curb line, provided that the sign shall be not
less than ten feet above sidewalk level at its lowest point.
      (3)   Prohibited placement. No projecting shall be erected on the front,
rear or side wall of any building so as to project above the roof or cornice
wall or above the roof level where there is no cornice wall.
   (e)   Marquee and Marquee Signs.
      (1)   Limited placement. Marquee and marquee signs shall be limited to
places of public assemblage. No marquee or marquee sign shall extend beyond the
curb line, nor shall its lowest part be less than ten feet above the sidewalk
level.
      (2)   Safety factors. No permit for the construction of a marquee or
marquee sign shall be issued until expert opinion is submitted to the effect
that the proposed construction provides the necessary safety factor to carry
the weight of the marquee, together with the weight of the sign, in addition to
the probable weight of any show load.
      (3)   Attaching signs. Illuminated or nonilluminated signs may be
authorized to be attached or affixed to any authorized marquee or marquee sign.
Such signs may be attached either on the edges, sides or front, or hung beneath
a marquee or marquee sign, provided that the same are securely fixed to the
marquee or marquee sign and do not extend more than five feet above nor more
than one foot below the marquee or marquee sign.
   (f)   Other Devices. All other devices for display of outdoor advertising,
or giving commercial information, shall be constructed or maintained in strict
compliance with the general regulations set forth in Section
1490.02.
