         (ORC 1.43)
   (c)   Computation of Time.
      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
that next succeeding day which is not Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the
last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then
such act may be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a
legal holiday as defined in Ohio R.C. 1.14.
         (ORC 1.14)
      (3)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (4)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a
day named, no part of that day shall be included. If priority of legal rights
depends upon the order of events on the same day, such priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred. (ORC
1.15)
      (5)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.
   (d)   Authority. When the law requires an act to be done which may by law as
well be done by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be
construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (e)   Joint Authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to three
or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such
authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall be
otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
202.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of the Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
   (b) The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of the Codified
Ordinances does not, except as provided in subsection (c) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred with respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy with respect to any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
provision had not been repealed or amended.
   (c)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of a provision of the Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed
according to the provision as amended. (ORC 1.58)
202.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of a provision of the Codified Ordinances
applies to all re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections, or of subsections or other subdivisions of a section, such
reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any section, subsection or
other such subdivision included in such reference.
   (c)   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
202.06 CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevail.
   (d)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
202.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
           (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be propsective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
   (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
202.08 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the
offender shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise
provided.

256.12 DONATED LEAVE.
   Employees paid by warrant of the Village of Caldwell may donate sick,
personal or vacation leave to a fellow employee who is otherwise eligible to
accrue and use sick leave. The intent of the Leave Donation Program is to allow
employees to voluntarily provide assistance to their co- workers who are in
critical need of leave due to the serious illness of the employee or a member
of the employee's immediate family.
   (a)   Eligibility to Receive Donated Leave. An employee may receive donated
leave up to the number of hours the employee is scheduled to work each pay
period, if the employee:
      (1)   Has a serious illness or his or her immediate family member has a
serious illness;
      (2)   Has no accrued leave; and
      (3)   Has applied for any paid leave, worker's compensation or benefits
program for which the employee is eligible. Donated leave may be used to
satisfy the waiting period for these benefits. If needed, donated leave may be
used after the waiting period up to the amount equal to the benefit for which
the employee is pending approval. (e.g. 70% for disability leave benefits)
   (b)   Criteria for Donating Leave and Certification. Employees may donate
leave if the donating employee:
      (1)   Voluntarily elects to donate leave and does so with the
understanding that donated leave will not be returned;
      (2)   Donates a minimum of eight hours; and
      (3)   Retains a combined leave balance of at least 80 hours.
   Leave shall he donated in the same manner in which it would otherwise be
used.
   (c)   Employees who wish to donate leave shall certify:
      (1)   The name of the employee for whom the donated leave is intended;
      (2)   The type of leave and number of hours to be donated;
      (3)   They will maintain a minimum combined leave balance of at least 80
hours; and
      (4)   The leave is donated voluntarily, and he or she understands it will
not be returned.
   (d)   The leave donation shall be administered on a pay period by pay period
basis. Employees using donated leave shall be considered in active pay status
and shall accrue leave and any other benefits to which they would otherwise be
entitled. Leave accrued by an employee while using donated leave shall be used,
if necessary, in the following pay period before additional donated leave may
be received. Donated leave shall not count toward the probationary period of an
employee who receives donated leave during his or her probationary period.
Donated leave shall be considered sick leave, but shall never be converted into
a cash benefit.
   (e)   The Village shall ensure that no employees are forced to donate leave
and shall respect an employee's right of privacy. However, the Village may,
with permission of the employee who is in need of leave or a member of the
employee's immediate family, inform employees of their co-worker's critical
need for leave. The Village shall not directly solicit leave donations from
employees. The donation of leave shall occur on a strictly voluntary basis.
(Ord. 2004-06. Passed 5-10-04.)
256.13 USE OF VILLAGE PROPERTY.
   Employees of the Village who are assigned a Village vehicle for duty-to-

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
      
Chap. 290. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Caldwell has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Caldwell ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Caldwell, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08
and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed
by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not wave his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Noble County and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers
filed, together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and
such recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the
Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where
there is a right to a jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court
unless he or she demands a jury trial.
   The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by
Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not
made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to
jury trial in writing, a Mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Caldwell ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated “Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas,” the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section 434.01 of the Traffic
Code (DWI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

   Penalty - see Sections
408.01 and

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals are erected at all
intersections with such through highways, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more State routes that are through highways intersect and
no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines, on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation, that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes the stop sign under this subsection, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days
before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a continuous
length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or highway, or
portion thereof, and if they have “stop” or “yield” signs or traffic control
signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or highways.
For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway, or portion
thereof, shall be a Municipal corporation line, the physical terminus of the
street or highway, or any point on such street or highway at which vehicular
traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to traffic on
the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts, the Municipality
may, by ordinance, designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to
be a through street or highway, and thereafter the affected residence district
shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or more
through highways designated under this subsection intersect and no traffic
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation or by
local authority, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way or merge with all traffic proceeding
on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying words or symbols, and such lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and to pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green Indication.
            (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn, but vehicular traffic including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is

      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney or
agent, immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
         The person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a
qualified technician or chemist of the person's own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the request of a
police officer and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a
police officer.
      (4)   Any physician, registered nurse or qualified technician or chemist
who withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and any hospital,
first-aid station or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant

alcohol in the blood, breath or urine;
            3.   That the officer asked the person to take the designated

the arresting officer shall send a copy of the sworn report to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge for which the person was
arrested.
      (8)   Effect of report; use on appeal. The sworn report of an arresting
officer completed and sent to the State Registrar and the court under
paragraphs (f)(6)C. and (f)(7) hereof is prima-facie proof of the information
and statements that it contains and shall be admitted and considered as prima-
facie proof of the information and statements that it contains in any appeal
under paragraph (f)(13) hereof relative to any suspension of a person's

gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath, or the
person's urine contained a concentration of fourteen-hundredths of one gram or
more by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's urine at the time
of the alleged offense, the State Registrar shall enter into the State
Registrar's records the fact that the person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege was suspended by the
arresting officer under paragraph (f)(6)A. hereof and the period of the

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under paragraph (f)(6)A. hereof, for the period of time described in
Ohio R.C. 4511.191(E) or (F), is effective immediately from the time at which
the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.
Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that
resulted in the person being requested to take, or in the person taking, the
chemical test or tests under paragraph (f)(1) hereof, affects the suspension
only as described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(H)(2).
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person is arrested for operating a

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege is or is not suspended under paragraph (f)(9) or (10) hereof, the
person's initial appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be
held within five days of the person's arrest or the issuance of the citation to
the person, subject to any continuance granted by the court pursuant to
paragraph (f)(13) hereof regarding the issues specified in that paragraph.
      (13)   Appeal of suspension at initial appearance. If a person is
arrested for operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or for operating a vehicle with a
prohibited concentration of alcohol in the blood, breath or urine, and if the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended under paragraph (f)(9) or (10) hereof, the
person may appeal the suspension at the person's initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest, in the court in which the person will appear
on that charge, pursuant to this paragraph (f)(13) and Ohio R.C. 4511.191(H).
         If the person appeals the suspension at the person's initial
appearance, the appeal does not stay the operation of the suspension, subject
to Ohio R.C. 4511.191(H)(2).
         If the person appeals the suspension at the person's initial
appearance, either the person or the State Registrar may request a continuance
of the appeal. Either the person or the State Registrar shall make the request
for a continuance of the appeal at the same time as the making of the appeal.
Neither the request for nor the granting of a continuance stays the operation
of the suspension that is the subject of the appeal.
         The scope, procedures and conditions of the appeal shall be as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(H)(1) and (2).

subject to the sanctions described in Ohio R.C. 2903.04(D);
               d.   Ohio R.C. 2903.06(A)(1) or Ohio R.C. 2903.08(A)(1) or a
municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to either of those
provisions;
               e.   Ohio R.C. 2903.06(A)(2), (3) or (4), Ohio R.C. 2903.08(A)
(2) or former Ohio R.C. 2903.07, or a municipal ordinance that is substantially
similar to any of those provisions, in a case in which the jury or judge found
that the offender was under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
alcohol and a drug of abuse; or
               f.   A statute of the United States or of any other state or a
municipal ordinance of a municipal corporation located in any other state that
is substantially similar to Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or subsection (a) or
(b) hereof.
            2.   The person is arrested for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19
(A), subsection (a) hereof, or an ordinance of another municipality that is
substantially similar to subsection (a) hereof, and the person previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A),
under circumstances in which the violation was a felony, regardless of when the
prior felony violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) and the conviction or guilty
plea occurred.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and paragraphs (h)
(3) to (5) hereof, the officer making an arrest of the type described in
paragraph (h)(2)A. hereof shall seize the vehicle and its license plates
regardless of whether the vehicle is registered in the name of the person who
was operating it or in the name of another person. This section does not apply
to or affect any rented or leased vehicle that is being rented or leased for a
period of thirty days or less, except that a law enforcement agency that
employs a law enforcement officer who makes an arrest of a type that is
described in paragraph (h)(2)A. hereof and that involves a rented or leased
vehicle of this type, shall notify, within twenty-four hours after the officer
makes the arrest, the lessor or owner of the vehicle regarding the
circumstances of the arrest and the location at which the vehicle may be picked
up. At the time of the seizure of the vehicle, the law enforcement officer who
made the arrest shall give the vehicle operator written notice that the vehicle
and its license plates have been seized; that the vehicle either will be kept
by the officer's law enforcement agency or will be immobilized at least until
the operator's initial appearance on the charge of the offense for which the
arrest was made; that, at the initial appearance, the court, in certain
circumstances, may order that the vehicle and license plates be released to the
vehicle owner until the disposition of that charge; that, if the vehicle
operator is convicted of that charge, the court generally must order the
immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the
forfeiture of the vehicle; and that, if the operator is not the vehicle owner,
the operator immediately should inform the vehicle owner that the vehicle and
its license plates have been seized and that the vehicle owner may be able to
obtain their return or release at the initial appearance or thereafter.
      (3)   Notice to court and vehicle owner. The arresting officer or a law
enforcement officer of the agency that employs the arresting officer shall give
written notice of the seizure to the court that will conduct the initial
appearance of the vehicle operator. The notice shall be given when the charges
are filed against the vehicle operator. Upon receipt of the notice, the court
promptly shall determine whether the vehicle operator is the vehicle owner and
whether there are any liens recorded on the certificate of title to the
vehicle. If the court determines that the vehicle operator is not the vehicle
owner, it promptly shall send by regular mail written notice of the seizure of
the motor vehicle to the vehicle owner and to all lienholders recorded on the
certificate of title. The written notice to the vehicle owner and lienholders
shall contain all of the information required by paragraph (h)(2)B. hereof to
be in a notice to be given to the vehicle operator and also shall specify the
date, time and place of the vehicle operator's initial appearance. The notice
also shall inform the vehicle owner that if title to a motor vehicle that is
subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this section is assigned or
transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)(2) or (3) applies, the court may fine the
vehicle operator the value of the vehicle. The notice to the vehicle owner also
shall state that if the vehicle is immobilized under Ohio R.C. 4503.233(A),
seven days after the end of the period of immobilization a law enforcement
agency will send the vehicle owner a notice, informing the vehicle owner that
if the release of the vehicle is not obtained in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4503.233(D)(3), the vehicle shall be forfeited. The notice also shall inform
the vehicle owner that the vehicle owner may be charged expenses or charges
incurred under this subsection and Ohio R.C. 4503.233 for the removal and
storage of the vehicle.
         The written notice that is given to the vehicle operator or is sent or
delivered to the vehicle owner if the vehicle owner is not the vehicle operator
also shall state that if the vehicle operator pleads guilty to or is convicted
of the offense for which the vehicle operator was arrested and the court issues
an immobilization and impoundment order relative to that vehicle, Ohio R.C.
4503.233(D)(4) prohibits the vehicle from being sold during the period of
immobilization without the prior approval of the court.
      (4)   Release of vehicle and license plates to vehicle owner. At or
before the initial appearance, the vehicle owner may file a motion requesting
the court to order that the vehicle and its license plates be released to the
vehicle owner. Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2) to (5) hereof and
subject to the payment of expenses or charges incurred in the removal and
storage of the vehicle, the court, in its discretion, then may issue an order
releasing the vehicle and its license plates to the vehicle owner. Such an
order may be conditioned upon such terms as the court determines appropriate,
including the posting of a bond in an amount determined by the court. If the
vehicle operator is not the vehicle owner and if the vehicle owner is not
present at the vehicle operator's initial appearance, and if the court believes
that the vehicle owner was not provided with adequate notice of the initial
appearance, the court, in its discretion, may allow the vehicle owner to file a
motion within seven days of the initial appearance. If the court allows the
vehicle owner to file such a motion after the initial appearance, the extension
of time granted by the court does not extend the time within which the initial
appearance is to be conducted. If the court issues an order for the release of
the vehicle and its license plates, a copy of the order shall be made available
to the vehicle owner. If the vehicle owner presents a copy of the order to the
law enforcement agency that employs the law enforcement officer who arrested
the person who was operating the vehicle, the law enforcement agency promptly
shall release the vehicle and its license plates to the vehicle owner upon
payment by the vehicle owner of any expenses or charges incurred in the removal
and storage of the vehicle.
      (5)   Disposition of seized vehicles and license plates. A vehicle seized
under paragraph (h)(2)A. hereof either shall be towed to a place specified by
the law enforcement agency that employs the arresting officer, to be safely
kept by the agency at that place for the time and in the manner specified in
this subsection (h), or shall be otherwise immobilized for the time and in the
manner specified in this subsection (h). A law enforcement officer of that
agency shall remove the identification license plates of the vehicle, and they
shall be safely kept by the agency for the time and in the manner specified in
this subsection (h). No vehicle that is seized and either towed or immobilized
pursuant to paragraphs (h)(2) to (5) hereof shall be considered contraband for
purposes of Ohio R.C. 2933.41, 2933.42 or 2933.43. The vehicle shall not be
immobilized at any place other than a commercially operated private storage
lot, a place owned by a law enforcement agency or other government agency, or a
place to which one of the following applies:
         A.   The place is leased by or otherwise under the control of a law
enforcement agency or other government agency.
         B.   The place is owned by the vehicle operator, the vehicle
operator's spouse, or a parent or child of the vehicle operator.
         C.   The place is owned by a private person, and, prior to the
immobilization, the private person that owns the place, or the authorized agent
of that private person, has given express written consent for the
immobilization to be carried out at that place.
         D.   The place is a street or highway on which the vehicle is parked
in accordance with law.
      (6)   Keeping of vehicles and license plates pending initial appearance
of operator. A vehicle that is seized under paragraphs (h)(2) to (5) hereof
shall be safely kept at the place to which it is towed or otherwise moved by
the law enforcement agency that employs the arresting officer until the initial
appearance of the vehicle operator relative to the charge in question. The
license plates of the vehicle that are removed pursuant to paragraphs (h)(2) to
(5) hereof shall be safely kept by the law enforcement agency that employs the
arresting officer until the initial appearance of the vehicle operator relative
to the charge in question.
      (7)   Initial appearance; sentence; orders for immobilization of vehicle,
impoundment of license plates or forfeiture of vehicle. At the initial
appearance or not less than seven days prior to the date of final disposition,
the court shall notify the vehicle operator, if the vehicle operator is the
vehicle owner, that if title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for
criminal forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C.
4503.234 applies, the court may fine the vehicle operator the value of the
vehicle. If, at the initial appearance, the vehicle operator pleads guilty to
the violation of subsection (a) hereof, or pleads no contest to and is
convicted of the violation, the court shall impose sentence upon the vehicle
operator pursuant to subsection (j) hereof; the court, except as provided in
paragraphs (h)(6) through (8) hereof, and subject to Ohio R.C. 4503.235, shall
order the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license
plates under Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and subsection (g) hereof or subsection (j)
hereof, or the criminal forfeiture of the vehicle under Ohio R.C. 4503.234 and
subsection (g) hereof or subsection (j) hereof, whichever is applicable; and
the vehicle and its license plates shall not be returned or released to the
vehicle owner. If the vehicle operator is not the vehicle owner, and the
vehicle owner is not present at the vehicle operator's initial appearance, and
if the court believes that the vehicle owner was not provided adequate notice
of the initial appearance, the court, in its discretion, may refrain for a
period of time not exceeding seven days from ordering the immobilization of the
vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the criminal forfeiture
of the vehicle, so that the vehicle owner may appear before the court to
present evidence as to why the court should not order the immobilization of the
vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the criminal forfeiture
of the vehicle. If the court refrains from ordering the immobilization of the
vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the criminal forfeiture
of the vehicle, Ohio R.C. 4503.235 applies relative to the order of
immobilization and impoundment, or the order of forfeiture.
      (8)   Dismissal of charge; return of vehicle and license plates. If, at
any time, the charge that the vehicle operator violated subsection (a) hereof
is dismissed for any reason, the court shall order that the vehicle seized at
the time of the arrest and its license plates immediately be released to the
vehicle owner subject to the payment of expenses or charges incurred in the
removal and storage of the vehicle.
      (9)   Retention of vehicle and license plates pendente lite; disposition
upon final adjudication of charge. If a vehicle is seized under paragraphs (h)
(2) to (5) hereof and is not returned or released to the vehicle owner pursuant
to paragraphs (h)(6) to (8) hereof, the vehicle or its license plates shall be
retained until the final disposition of the charge in question. Upon the final
disposition of that charge, the court shall do whichever of the following is
applicable:
         A.   If the vehicle operator is convicted of or pleads guilty to the
violation of subsection (a) hereof, the court shall impose sentence upon the
vehicle operator pursuant to subsection (j) hereof and, subject to Ohio R.C.
4503.235, shall order the immobilization of the vehicle the vehicle operator
was operating at the time of, or that was involved in, the offense, and the
impoundment of its license plates under Ohio R.C. 4503.233, subsection (g)
hereof or subsection (j) hereof, or the criminal forfeiture of the vehicle
under Ohio R.C. 4503.234, subsection (g) hereof or subsection (j) hereof,
whichever is applicable.
         B.   If the vehicle operator is found not guilty of the violation of
subsection (a) hereof, the court shall order that the vehicle and its license
plates immediately be released to the vehicle owner upon the payment of any
expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage.
         C.   If the charge that the vehicle operator violated subsection (a)
hereof is dismissed for any reason, the court shall order that the vehicle and
its license plates immediately be released to the vehicle owner upon the
payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage.
      (10)   Credit of period of detention of vehicle and license plates
against period of immobilization and impoundment. If a vehicle is seized under
paragraphs (h)(2) to (5) hereof, the time between the seizure of the vehicle
and either its release to the vehicle owner under paragraphs (h)(6) to (8)
hereof, or the issuance of an order of immobilization of the vehicle under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233, shall be credited against the period of immobilization ordered
by the court.
      (11)   Towing and storage charges. The vehicle owner may be charged
expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the immobilized
vehicle. The court with jurisdiction over the case, after notice to all
interested parties, including lienholders, and after an opportunity for them to
be heard, if the vehicle owner fails to appear in person, without good cause,
or if the court finds that the vehicle owner does not intend to seek release of
the vehicle at the end of the period of immobilization under Ohio R.C. 4503.233
or that the vehicle owner is not or will not be able to pay the expenses and
charges incurred in its removal and storage, may order that title to the
vehicle be transferred, in order of priority, first into the name of the person
who removed it, next into the name of a lienholder, or lastly into the name of
the owner of the place of storage.
         Any lienholder that receives title under a court order shall do so on
the condition that it pay any expenses or charges incurred in the vehicle's
removal and storage. If the person who receives title to the vehicle is the
person who removed it, the person shall receive title on the condition that it
pay any lien on the vehicle. The court shall not order that title be
transferred to any person other than the owner of the place of storage if the
person refuses to receive the title. Any person who receives title either may
keep title to the vehicle or may dispose of the vehicle in any legal manner
that the person considers appropriate, including assignment of the certificate
of title to the motor vehicle to a salvage dealer or a scrap metal processing
facility. The person shall not transfer the vehicle to the person who is the
vehicle's immediate previous owner.
         If the person assigns the motor vehicle to a salvage dealer or scrap
metal processing facility, the person shall send the assigned certificate of
title to the motor vehicle to the clerk of the court of common pleas of the
county in which the salvage dealer or scrap metal processing facility is
located. The person shall mark the face of the certificate of title with the
words “For Destruction” and shall deliver a photocopy of the certificate of
title to the salvage dealer or scrap metal processing facility for its records.
         Whenever a court issues an order under this paragraph (h)(11), the
court shall also order removal of the license plates from the vehicle and cause
them to be sent to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles if they have not already
been sent to the Registrar. Thereafter, no further proceedings shall take place
under this section or under Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         Prior to initiating a proceeding under this paragraph (h)(11), and
upon payment of the fee under Ohio R.C. 4505.14(B), any interested party may
cause a search to be made of the public records of the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles or the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas to ascertain the identity of
any lienholder of the vehicle. The initiating party shall furnish this
information to the clerk of the court with jurisdiction over the case, and the
clerk shall provide notice to the vehicle owner, the defendant, any lienholder,
and any other interested parties listed by the initiating party, at the last
known address supplied by the initiating party, by certified mail or, at the
option of the initiating party, by personal service or ordinary mail. (ORC

citation. If a person is arrested for operating a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or for
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the blood,
breath or urine, and regardless of whether the person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not
suspended under paragraph (f)(9) or (10) hereof, the person's initial
appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five

      (2)   Imposition of new suspension of license or permit upon termination
of prior suspension at initial appearance. If a person is arrested as described
in paragraph (i)(1) hereof, if the person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege has been suspended under
paragraph (f)(9) or (10) hereof, in relation to that arrest, if the person
appeals the suspension in accordance with paragraph (f)(13) hereof, and if the
judge, magistrate or mayor terminates the suspension in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(H)(2), the judge, magistrate or mayor may impose a new suspension
of the person's license, permit or nonresident operating privilege,
notwithstanding the termination of the suspension imposed under paragraph (f)
(9) or (10) hereof, if the judge, magistrate or mayor determines that the
person's continued driving will be a threat to public safety.
      (3)   Imposition of new suspension of license or permit at initial
appearance without prior suspension. If a person is arrested as described in
paragraph (i)(1) hereof, and if the person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege has not been suspended
under paragraph (f)(9) or (10) hereof, in relation to that arrest, the judge,
magistrate or mayor may impose a suspension of the person's license, permit or
nonresident operating privilege if the judge, magistrate or mayor determines
that the person's continued driving will be a threat to public safety.
      (4)   Duration of new suspension; credit of suspension period against
later judicial suspension. A suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under paragraph
(i)(2) or (3) hereof shall continue until the complaint on the charge resulting
from the arrest is adjudicated on the merits. A court that imposes a suspension
under paragraph (i)(3) hereof shall send the person's driver's license or
permit to the State Registrar. If the court possesses the driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit of a person in the category described in
paragraph (i)(3) hereof and the court does not impose a suspension under
paragraph (i)(3) hereof, the court shall return the license or permit to the
person if the license or permit has not otherwise been suspended or revoked.
         Any time during which the person serves a suspension of the person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege that is imposed pursuant to paragraph (i)(2) or (3) hereof shall be
credited against any judicial suspension of the person's license, permit or
nonresident operating privilege that is imposed pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4507.16
(B).

violates paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3) or (4) hereof shall, in addition to the

imprisonment of three consecutive days and may sentence the offender, pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2929.21, to a longer term of imprisonment. In addition, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not less than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
         The court may suspend the execution of the mandatory three consecutive
days of imprisonment that it is required to impose by this paragraph if the
court, in lieu of the suspended term of imprisonment, places the offender on
probation and requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory three
consecutive days of imprisonment that it is required to impose by this
paragraph if the court places the offender on probation for part of the three
consecutive days; requires the offender to attend, for that part of the three
consecutive days, a drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 3793.10, and sentences the offender to a term of imprisonment equal
to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the drivers' intervention program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of probation, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 3793 by the Director of Alcohol and Drug
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at a drivers'
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers' intervention program
determine that the offender should attend, and to report periodically to the
court on his or her progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of probation on the offender that it considers necessary.

incarceration, the fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be paid to the political
subdivision that paid the cost of housing the offender during that period of
confinement. The political subdivision shall use this share to pay or reimburse
incarceration or treatment costs it incurs in housing or providing drug and
alcohol treatment to persons who violate Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or this section and
to pay for ignition interlock devices and electronic house arrest equipment for
persons who violate those sections. Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) of the fine

               As an alternative to the term of imprisonment required to be
imposed by this paragraph, but subject to paragraph (j)(12) hereof, the court
may impose upon the offender a sentence consisting of both a term of
imprisonment of five consecutive days and not less than eighteen consecutive
days of electronically monitored house arrest, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2929.23
(A). The five consecutive days of imprisonment and the period of electronically
monitored house arrest shall not exceed six months. The five consecutive days
of imprisonment do not have to be served prior to or consecutively with the
period of electronically monitored house arrest.
               In addition, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of
not less than three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) and not more than one
thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500).
               In addition to any other sentence that it imposes upon the

the drivers' intervention program determine that the offender is alcohol
dependent, they shall notify the court, and the court shall order the offender
to obtain treatment through an alcohol and drug addiction program authorized by
Ohio R.C. 3793.02. The cost of the treatment shall be paid by the offender.

the consumption of alcoholic beverages. One hundred fifteen dollars ($115.00)
of the fine imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the political
subdivision that pays the cost of housing the offender during the offender's
term of incarceration. This share shall be used by the political subdivision to
pay or reimburse incarceration or treatment costs it incurs in housing or
providing drug and alcohol treatment to persons who violate Ohio R.C. 4511.19
or this section and to pay for ignition interlock devices and electronic house
arrest equipment for persons who violate such sections, and shall be paid to
the credit of the fund that pays the cost of the incarceration. Fifty dollars
($50.00) of the fine imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited into
the County or Municipal Indigent Drivers Alcohol Treatment Fund under the
control of the court that imposes the fine, as created by the County or the
Municipality pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.191(N) or paragraph (f)(19) hereof. The
balance of the fine shall be disbursed as otherwise provided by law.
               B.   Regardless of whether the vehicle the offender was
operating at the time of the offense is registered in the offender's name or in
the name of another person, the court, in addition to the penalties imposed

or permit to, any person who is a resident of this Municipality and is
convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of a statute of any other state or
a municipal ordinance of a municipal corporation located in any other state
that is substantially similar to Ohio R.C. 4511.19 and subsections (a) and (b)
hereof. Upon receipt of a report from another state, made pursuant to Ohio R.C.
4507.60, indicating that a resident of this Municipality was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to an offense described in this subsection (m), the State
Registrar shall send a notice by regular first class mail to the person, at the
person's last known address as shown in the records of the State Bureau of
Motor Vehicles, informing the person of the suspension or denial, that the
suspension or denial will take effect twenty-one days from the date of the
notice, and that if the person wishes to appeal the suspension or denial, the
person must file a notice of appeal within twenty-one days of the date of the
notice requesting a hearing on the matter. If the person requests a hearing,
the State Registrar shall hold the hearing not more than forty days after
receipt by the State Registrar of the notice of appeal. The filing of a notice
of appeal does not stay the operation of the suspension or denial that must be
imposed pursuant to this subsection (m). The scope of the hearing shall be
limited to whether the person actually was convicted of or pleaded guilty to
the offense for which the suspension or denial is to be imposed.
         The period of suspension or denial the State Registrar is required to
impose under this paragraph shall end either on the last day of any period of
suspension of the person's nonresident operating privilege imposed by the state

a report from another state, made pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4507.60, indicating
that a child who is a resident of this Municipality was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to an offense described in this subsection (m), the State Registrar
shall send a notice by regular first class mail to the child, at the child's
last known address as shown in the records of the State Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, informing the child of the suspension or denial, that the suspension
or denial will take effect twenty-one days from the date of the notice, and
that if the child wishes to appeal the suspension or denial the child must file
a notice of appeal within twenty-one days of the date of the notice requesting
a hearing on the matter. If the child requests a hearing, the State Registrar
shall hold the hearing not more than forty days after receipt by the State
Registrar of the notice of appeal. The filing of a notice of appeal does not
stay the operation of the suspension or denial that must be imposed pursuant to
this subsection (m). The scope of the hearing shall be limited to whether the
child actually was convicted of or pleaded guilty to the offense for which the
suspension or denial is to be imposed.
         The period of suspension the State Registrar is required to impose
under this paragraph shall end either on the last day of any period of
suspension of the child's nonresident operating privilege imposed by the state
or Federal court located in the other state or the date six months and twenty-
one days from the date of the notice sent by the State Registrar to the child

Municipality who is sixteen years of age or older and does not have a current,
valid Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, the notice shall
inform the child that the child will be denied issuance of a driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit for six months beginning on the date of
the notice. If the child has not attained the age of sixteen years on the date
of the notice, the notice shall inform the child that the period of denial of
six months shall commence on the date the child attains the age of sixteen
years.
      (3)   Petition for occupational driving privileges. Any person whose
license or permit has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (m)(1) or (2) hereof
may file a petition in the municipal or county court, or, in case the person is
under eighteen years of age, the juvenile court, in whose jurisdiction the
person resides, agreeing to pay the cost of the proceedings and alleging that
the suspension would seriously affect the person's ability to continue the
person's employment.
         The proceedings upon such petition shall be as set forth in Ohio R.C.
4507.169(E).

than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21 by the Ohio Director of Transportation or local
authority, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the same at a speed
not exceeding the following:
      (1)   Fifteen miles per hour on all alleys within the Municipality;
      (2)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected,
except that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by paragraph (b)(5) hereof, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by paragraph (b)(6) hereof. The end of every school zone may be marked by a
sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section or in the Manual
and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic Control Devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding
year filed with the Ohio Department of Education, in compliance with Rule 3301-
35-08 of the Ohio Administrative Code, a copy of the school's report for the

standards for nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of
this filing to the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment
of a school zone.
         C.   As used in this section, “school zone” means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway, and also includes that portion of a State highway. Upon request from
local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Ohio Director of
Transportation, the Director may extend the traditional school zone boundaries.
The distances in paragraphs (b)(2)C.1., 2. and 3. hereof shall not exceed 300
feet per approach per direction and are bounded by whichever of the following
distances or combinations thereof the Director approves as most appropriate:

lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction; or
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.

the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in paragraphs (b)
(2)A. and C. hereof.
         D.   As used in this section, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Section

traffic and other information as the Ohio Director of Transportation considers
necessary, designate a school zone on any portion of a State route lying within
the Municipality that includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going
to or leaving a school during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever
the distance, as measured in a straight line, from the school property line
nearest the crosswalk to the nearest point of the crosswalk is not more than

hereof.
   (e)   In every charge of violation of this section, the affidavit and
warrant shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven, and, in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c)
hereof, the speed which is prima-facie lawful at the time and place of such
alleged violation, as the same is set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5)

is alleged, the defendant shall be charged in a single affidavit, alleging a
single act, with a violation indicated of both paragraph (b)(1), (2), (3), (4)
or (5) hereof, or of a limit declared pursuant to subsections (h) through (j)
hereof or Ohio R.C. 4511.21 by the Ohio Director of Transportation or local
authority, and of the limitation in paragraph (d)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6)
hereof. If the Court finds a violation of paragraph (b)(1), (2), (3), (4) or
(5) hereof, or of a limit declared pursuant to subsections (h) through (j)
hereof or Ohio R.C. 4511.21, has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of

basis of a geometric and traffic characteristic study, that any speed limit set
forth in subsections (b) through (d) hereof is greater than is reasonable or
safe under the conditions found to exist at any portion of a street or highway
under the jurisdiction of the Director, the Director shall determine and
declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit, which shall be effective
when appropriate signs giving notice of it are erected at the location.
   (i)    (1)   Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) hereof, whenever Council
determines, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation, that

highway under its jurisdiction, is greater than is reasonable and safe under
the conditions found to exist at such location, Council may, by resolution,
request the Director to determine and declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie
speed limit. Upon receipt of such request, the Director may determine and
declare a reasonable and safe prima- facie speed limit at such location, and if
the Director does so, then such declared speed limit shall become effective
only when appropriate signs giving notice thereof are erected at such location
by the Municipality. The Director may withdraw the declaration of a prima-facie
speed limit whenever in the Director's opinion the altered prima-facie speed
becomes unreasonable. Upon such withdrawal, the declared prima-facie speed
shall become ineffective and the signs relating thereto shall be immediately
removed by the Municipality.
      (2)   Council may determine, on the basis of a geometric and traffic
characteristic study, that the speed limit of sixty-five miles per hour on a
portion of a freeway under its jurisdiction that was established through the
operation of Ohio R.C. 4511.21(L)(3) is greater than is reasonable or safe
under the conditions found to exist at that portion of the freeway. If Council
makes such a determination, Council by resolution may request the Director to
determine and declare a reasonable and safe speed limit of not less than fifty-
five miles per hour for that portion of the freeway. If the Director takes such
action, the declared speed limit becomes effective only when appropriate signs
giving notice of it are erected at such location by the Municipality.
   (j)   Council may authorize by ordinance higher prima-facie speeds than
those stated in this section upon through highways, or upon highways or
portions thereof where there are no intersections, or between widely spaced
intersections, provided that signs are erected giving notice of the authorized
speed, but Council shall not modify or alter the basic rule set forth in
subsection (a) hereof or in any event authorize by ordinance a speed in excess
of fifty miles per hour.
   Alteration of prima-facie limits on State routes by Council shall not be
effective until the alteration has been approved by the Director. The Director
may withdraw approval of any altered prima-facie speed limits whenever in the
Director's opinion any altered prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and upon
such withdrawal, the altered prima-facie speed shall become ineffective and the
signs relating thereto shall be immediately removed by the Municipality.

456.01 PARKING VIOLATIONS AS CIVIL INFRACTIONS.
   All parking infractions that are a violation under City Code Chapter 452 and
that occur within the Village limits of Caldwell shall be civil infractions
handled pursuant to and be governed by this chapter and R.C. Chapter 4521, when
applicable. The provisions of this chapter and all actions taken pursuant to
this chapter are civil and remedial in nature and not designed to punish the
offender and are not criminal offenses. No violation shall be considered a
misdemeanor of any class, and no person shall be arrested for a violation of a
parking violation.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 8-11-14.)
456.02 PARKING TICKETS.
   A parking ticket shall be the summons and complaint for purposes of issuing
parking ticket citations. Each parking ticket issued shall contain the
following information:
   (a)   That the person upon whom it is served must answer in relation to the
parking infraction charged in the ticket;
   (b)   The allowable answers that may be made and that the person will be
afforded a hearing if he or she denies committing the parking infraction;
   (c)   That any answer must be made to the Caldwell Village Clerk, the
address for the Village Clerk, and the time within which an answer is to be
made;
   (d)   The penalties that may result from failure to timely answer and the
fine that arises from the parking infraction; and
   (e)   A warning that failure to timely answer or to appear at a requested
hearing will be considered an admission of the parking infraction.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 8-11-14.)
456.03 PROCEDURES RELATIVE TO PARKING TICKETS.
   (a)   The officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking infraction shall
complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction charged, recording
the license plate number, type, and make or model of the vehicle, and
indicating the date, time, and place of the parking infraction charged. The
officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains. If the operator
of the vehicle is present, the officer also shall record on the ticket the name
of the operator in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the
offender, and then shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator.
If the operator of the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the
word "owner" in the space provided on the ticket upon the owner of the vehicle
by affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Constructive
service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by affixation as
provided in this division has the same force and effect, and potentially
subjects both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
results in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine and the same
penalties for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested,
as if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator
of the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (b)   The original of the parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the Village and of the law enforcement agency whose officer issued
it, and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (c)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance
with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator
in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement.
   (d)   When a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is served
pursuant to this section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and the
owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine or penalty arising out
of the parking infraction.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 8-11-14.)
456.04 ANSWER TO CHARGES.
   (a)   A person who is served with a parking ticket charging the commission
of a parking infraction may answer the charge by personal appearance at the
Village of Caldwell Police Department during normal business hours or by mail.
The answer shall be made within ten days of the issuance of the parking ticket
(the mailing must be postmarked within ten days of the issuance of the ticket)
and shall be:
      (1)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction by
payment of the fine or;
      (2)   A denial that the infraction occurred and a request for a hearing.
A denial must be written on the back of the ticket when a denial is entered.
Otherwise, the person need only pay the fine to the Clerk.
   (b)   When a person denies that he or she has committed a parking violation,
he or she shall be granted a hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by the
Mayor, or his or her designee. The person shall be served a written notice
stating the location, date, and time of the said hearing.
   (c)   Any person found guilty of a parking violation after hearing shall
have the right to appeal to the Noble County Court within ten days of the date
of the decision. Said appeal shall be in writing with a copy served on the
Village Clerk and the original filed with the Noble County Court.
   (d)   A person who admits that he or she has committed a parking infraction
shall pay the fine to the Clerk to which the answer is made.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 8-11-14.)
456.05 FAILURE TO ANSWER; PROCEDURES.
   (a)   When a person is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction and the person fails to
answer the charge within the time specified by the local authority, the Village
shall issue a notice of infraction and send such notification of infraction as
follows:
      (1)   If the person who fails to answer was the operator of the vehicle
involved in the parking infraction at the time of the commission of the parking
infraction and was personally served with the parking ticket, a notification of
the infraction shall be sent to that person, and additionally if such person is
not the owner of the vehicle, as determined from the records of the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles, a notification of infraction also shall be sent to the owner at
his most recent address appearing in such records;
      (2)   If the person was constructively served with the parking ticket, a
notification of infraction shall be sent to the owner at his or her most recent
address appearing in the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
      (3)   All citations that are unanswered or citations that have been
answered but the fine has not been paid may be referred by the Village and may
be filed with the Noble County Court for prosecution.
   (b)   A notification of the infraction shall be sent within twelve months
after the expiration of the time specified in Section
456.03 for the marking of an answer, shall be sent by first class mail, and
shall contain all of the following:
      (1)   An identification of the parking infraction with which the person
was charged and the time and date of the parking infraction, which
identification may be a copy of the parking ticket charging the parking
infraction that was personally or constructively served upon the person;
      (2)   An identification of the amount of the fine, penalties, and costs
arising out of the parking infraction that are due;
      (3)   A warning that the person must answer the parking infraction
charged in the ticket within thirty days or a default civil judgment in the
amount of the fine, penalties, and costs due may be entered against the person;
      (4)   A description of the allowable answers that may be made and
notification that the person will be afforded a hearing before the Mayor or his
or her designee if he or she denies in his or her answer that he or she
committed the parking infraction;
      (5)   An identification of the manners in which and the entity to which
an answer may be made;
      (6)   A warning that if the person fails to appear at a requested
hearing, a default civil judgment in the amount of the fine, penalties, and
costs due may be entered against the person;
      (7)   A warning that the registration of the vehicle involved in the
parking infraction, if the vehicle is registered in this state, may not be
renewed or transferred if a civil judgment or a default civil judgment is
entered against the person until the judgment is paid or until it is otherwise
finally disposed of in a manner specified in this chapter.
   (c)   A person who receives a notification of infraction pursuant to this
section may answer the parking infraction with which he or she is charged that
is identified in the notification of infraction in any of the manners provided
in Section
456.03. An answer under this section shall be made within ten days after the
date on which the notification of the infraction was mailed. The answer shall
be governed by the provisions of Section
456.03 for answers relative to parking infractions charged in a parking ticket.
   (d)   If a person who is issued a notification of infraction fails to timely
answer, as provided in division (c) of this section, the failure to answer
shall be considered an admission that the person committed the parking
infraction.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 8-11-14.)
456.06 PROCEEDS AGAINST REGISTRATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE.
   In addition to any other penalty otherwise provided by law, if three or more
judgments or default judgments have been entered against a person and the
person has not paid the judgments or default judgments within ten days of the
date of entry of the third judgment, the Caldwell Village Clerk may give notice
of that fact to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. The notice, if given, shall be
given not earlier than sixteen days nor later than three years after the date
of entry of the third judgment, and shall be in a form and manner, and contain
such information, as the Registrar of Motor Vehicles prescribes. The provisions
of R.C. § 4521.10 shall govern the vehicular registration issuance.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 8-11-14.)
456.07 FINES, PENALTIES AND COSTS.
   (a)   The Village Clerk shall adopt a fine schedule for a violation of civil
infractions and prescribe an additional penalty or penalties for failure to

any act expressly forbidden by law with respect to the public servant's office.
   (f)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of
dereliction of duty, a misdemeanor of the second degree, and shall be subject
to the penalty provided in Section
698.02.
   (g)   As used in this section, “public servant” includes an officer or

authority, shall knowingly deprive or conspire or attempt to deprive, any
person of a constitutional or statutory right or a right created by ordinance,
resolution or regulation.

rights, a misdemeanor of the first degree, and shall be subject to the penalty
provided in Section

   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense under this General
Offenses Code, shall engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or
result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in

actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.

offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance

abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed

of the next lesser degree than the offense attempted. In the case of an attempt
to commit an offense that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a
misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. An
attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an
offense under this section. The penalty shall be as provided in Section
698.02.

624.01 of this General Offenses Code. (ORC 2923.02)

      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01 (Conspiracy);
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
    (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
606.21.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
or her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity of a witness may affect his or her credibility and make his
or her testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with
great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

this section or in terms of the principal offense. (ORC 2923.03)

is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the purpose of
providing scientific services to law enforcement agencies and signed by the
person performing the analysis, stating that the substance which is the basis
of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings
as to the content, weight and identity of the substance and that it contains
any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima-facie evidence of the content, identity and weight or the
existence and number of unit dosages of the substance.
   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by the
signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that he or she
is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing the
analysis is a part of his or her regular duties, and giving an outline of his

636.17(c) of this General Offenses Code, or Ohio R.C. 2919.27, or with a
violation of any other municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to such
sections, or with contempt of court, which charge is based on an alleged
violation of a protection order issued under this section, did not commit the
violation or was not in contempt of court.
      (4)   A.   Except when the complaint involves a person who is a family or
household member as defined in Section
636.17(a) of this General Offenses Code, upon the filing of a complaint that
alleges a violation specified in paragraph (b)(1) hereof, the court, upon its
own motion, may issue a protection order as a pretrial condition of release of
the alleged offender if it finds that the safety and protection of the
complainant or the alleged victim may be impaired by the continued presence of
the alleged offender.
         B.   If the court issues a protection order under this section as an
ex parte order, it shall conduct, as soon as possible, after the issuance of
the order but not later than the next day the court is in session after its
issuance, a hearing to determine whether the order should remain in effect, be
modified or be revoked. The hearing shall be conducted under the standards set
forth in paragraph (b)(3) hereof.
         C.   If a municipal court or a county court issues a protection order
under this section and if, subsequent to the issuance of the order, the alleged
offender who is the subject of the order is bound over to the Court of Common
Pleas for prosecution of a felony arising out of the same activities as those
that were the basis of the complaint upon which the order is based,
notwithstanding the fact that the order was issued by a municipal court or
county court, the order shall remain in effect, as though it were an order of
the Court of Common Pleas, while the charges against the alleged offender are
pending in the Court of Common Pleas, for the period of time described in
paragraph (b)(5)B. hereof, and the Court of Common Pleas has exclusive
jurisdiction to modify the order issued by the municipal court or county court.
This paragraph applies when the alleged offender is bound over to the Court of
Common Pleas as a result of the person waiving a preliminary hearing on the
felony charge, as a result of the municipal court or county court having
determined at a preliminary hearing that there is probable cause to believe
that the felony has been committed and that the alleged offender committed it,
as a result of the alleged offender having been indicted for the felony, or in
any other manner.
      (5)   A protection order that is issued as a pretrial condition of
release under this section:
         A.   Is in addition to, but shall not be construed as a part of, any
bail set under Rule 46 of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure;
         B.   Is effective only until the disposition by the court that issued
the order or, in the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(4)C. hereof, by
the Court of Common Pleas to which the alleged offender is bound over for
prosecution of the criminal proceeding arising out of the complaint upon which
the order is based or until the issuance under Ohio R.C. 2903.214 of a
protection order arising out of the same activities as those that were the
basis of the complaint filed under this section;
         C.   Shall not be construed as a finding that the alleged offender
committed the alleged offense, and shall not be introduced as evidence of the
commission of the offense at the trial of the alleged offender on the complaint
upon which the order is based.
      (6)   A person who meets the criteria for bail under Rule 46 of the Ohio
Rules of Criminal Procedure and who, if required to do so pursuant to that
Rule, executes or posts bond or deposits cash or securities as bail, shall not
be held in custody pending a hearing before the court on a motion requesting a
protection order under this section.
      (7)   A copy of a protection order that is issued under this section
shall be issued by the court to the complainant, to the alleged victim, to the
person who requested the order, to the defendant and to all law enforcement
agencies that have jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court shall direct
that a copy of the order be delivered to the defendant on the same day that the
order is entered. If a municipal court or a county court issues a protection
order under this section and if, subsequent to the issuance of the order, the
defendant who is the subject of the order is bound over to the Court of Common
Pleas for prosecution as described in paragraph (b)(4)C. hereof, the municipal
court or county court shall direct that a copy of the order be delivered to the
Court of Common Pleas to which the defendant is bound over.
      (8)   All law enforcement agencies shall establish and maintain an index
for the protection orders delivered to the agencies pursuant to paragraph (b)
(7) hereof. With respect to each order delivered, each agency shall note, on
the index, the date and time of the agency's receipt of the order.
      (9)   Regardless of whether the petitioner has registered the protection
order in the county in which the officer's agency has jurisdiction, any officer
of a law enforcement agency shall enforce a protection order issued pursuant to
this section in accordance with the provisions of the order.
      (10)   Upon a violation of a protection order issued pursuant to this
section, the court may issue another protection order under this section, as a
pretrial condition of release, that modifies the terms of the order that was
violated.
      (11)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no court
shall charge a fee for the filing of a motion pursuant to this section.

   (f)   In addition to any term of imprisonment, fine or other sentence,
penalty or sanction it imposes upon the offender pursuant to subsection (e)
hereof, or pursuant to any other provision of law, for a violation of

in the manner described in subsection (h) hereof, to perform not more than 200
hours of supervised community service work under the authority of any agency,
political subdivision or charitable organization of the type described in Ohio

   (g)   In addition to any term of imprisonment, fine or other sentence,
penalty or sanction imposed upon the offender pursuant to subsection (e)
hereof, or pursuant to any other provision of law, for a violation of
subsection (c) hereof, if, as part of the same trial or proceeding, the
offender is also convicted of or pleads guilty to a separate charge of

to perform supervised community service work under the authority of an agency,
subdivision or charitable organization, the requirement shall be part of the
community control sanction or sentence of the offender, and the court shall
impose the community service in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of this subsection. The court may require an offender whom it requires to
perform supervised community service work as part of the offender's community
control sanction or sentence to pay the court a reasonable fee to cover the
costs of the offender's participation in the work, including, but not limited

requires the offender to perform supervised community service work as part of
the offender's community control sanction or sentence, the court shall do so in
accordance with the following limitations and criteria:
      (1)   The court shall require that the community service work be
performed after completion of the term of imprisonment imposed upon the
offender for the violation of subsection (c) hereof, if applicable.
      (2)   The supervised community service work shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 2951.02(F)(1)(a) to (c).

offender in performing the work.
      (4)   The court shall inform the offender in writing that if the offender
does not adequately perform, as determined by the court, all of the required
community service work, the court may order that the offender be committed to a
jail or workhouse for a period of time that does not exceed the term of
imprisonment that the court could have imposed upon the offender for the
violation of subsection (c) hereof, reduced by the total amount of time that
the offender actually was imprisoned under the sentence or term that was
imposed upon the offender for that violation and by the total amount of time
that the offender was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for
which the offender was convicted and sentenced as described in Ohio R.C.
2949.08 and 2967.191, and that, if the court orders that the offender be so
committed, the court is authorized, but not required, to grant the offender
credit upon the period of the commitment for the community service work that
the offender adequately performed.
   (i)   If a court, pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) and subsection (h) hereof,
orders an offender to perform community service work as part of the offender's
community control sanction or sentence, and if the offender does not adequately
perform all of the required community service work, as determined by the court,
the court may order that the offender be committed to a jail or workhouse for a
period of time that does not exceed the term of imprisonment that the court
could have imposed upon the offender for the violation of subsection (c)
hereof, reduced by the total amount of time that the offender actually was
imprisoned under the sentence or term that was imposed upon the offender for
that violation and by the total amount of time that the offender was confined
for any reason arising out of the offense for which the offender was convicted
and sentenced as described in Ohio R.C. 2949.08 and 2967.191. The court may
order that a person committed pursuant to subsection (h) hereof or this
subsection shall receive hour- for-hour credit upon the period of the
commitment for the community service work that the offender adequately
performed. No commitment pursuant to subsection (h) hereof or this subsection
shall exceed the period of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing court
could have imposed upon the offender for the violation of subsection (c)
hereof, reduced by the total amount of time that the offender actually was
imprisoned under that sentence or term and by the total amount of time that the
offender was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for which the
offender was convicted and sentenced as described in Ohio R.C. 2949.08 and
2967.191.
   (j)   Paragraph (f)(1) and subsections (h) and (i) hereof do not limit or
affect the authority of the court to suspend the sentence imposed upon a
misdemeanor offender and place the offender on probation or otherwise suspend
the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.51 and 2951.02, to require the
misdemeanor offender, as a condition of the offender's probation or of
otherwise suspending the offender's sentence, to perform supervised community
service work in accordance with Ohio R.C. 2951.02(F), or to place a felony
offender under a community control sanction.
   (k)   (1)   If a court suspends an offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under paragraph
(f)(2) hereof, the period of the suspension shall be consecutive to, and
commence after, the period of suspension or revocation of the offender's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege that is imposed under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506, 4507, 4509 or 4511, or

that violation of subsection (c) hereof.

convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of one of the

to the named defendant, pursuant to its authority to issue such an order under

            I understand that I must appear before the court, at a time set by
the court within twenty-four hours after the filing of this motion, for a
hearing on the motion, or that, if I am unable to appear because of
hospitalization or a medical condition resulting from the offense alleged in
the complaint, a person who can provide information about my need for a
temporary protection order must appear before the court in lieu of my appearing
in court. I understand that any temporary protection order granted pursuant to
this motion is a pretrial condition of release and is effective only until the
disposition of the criminal proceeding arising out of the attached complaint,

of the person's hospitalization or medical condition resulting from the offense
alleged in the complaint, another person who is able to provide the court with
the information it requests may appear in lieu of the person who requested the
order. If the court finds that the safety and protection of the complainant,
alleged victim or any other family or household member of the alleged offender
may be impaired by the continued presence of the alleged offender, the court
may issue a temporary protection order, as a pretrial condition of release,
that contains terms designed to ensure the safety and protection of the
complainant, alleged victim or the family or household member, including a
requirement that the alleged offender refrain from entering the residence,
school, business or place of employment of the complainant, alleged victim or

   (5)   If the court issues a temporary protection order that includes a
requirement that the alleged offender refrain from entering the residence,
school, business or place of employment of the complainant, alleged victim or

entry into one of those places otherwise upon the consent of the complainant,
alleged victim or family or household member.
   (6)   Paragraph (b)(5) hereof does not limit any discretion of a court to
determine that an alleged offender charged with a violation of Ohio R.C.
2919.27, this subsection (b) hereof, or another municipal ordinance
substantially equivalent to that section, or with contempt of court, which
charge is based on an alleged violation of a temporary protection order issued
under this section, did not commit the violation or was not in contempt of
court.
   (7)   A.   Upon the filing of a complaint that alleges a violation of
subsection (a) hereof, or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.11, 2903.12, 2903.13,

636.02,
636.045 or
642.125 of this General Offenses Code, that involves a person who was a family
or household member at the time of the violation, the court, upon its own
motion, may issue a temporary protection order as a pretrial condition of
release if it finds that the safety and protection of the complainant, alleged
victim or other family or household member of the alleged offender may be
impaired by the continued presence of the alleged offender.
      B.   If the court issues a temporary protection order under this
subsection as an ex parte order, it shall conduct, as soon as possible after
the issuance of the order, a hearing in the presence of the alleged offender
not later than the next day on which the court is scheduled to conduct business
after the day on which the alleged offender was arrested, or at the time of the
appearance of the alleged offender pursuant to summons, to determine whether
the order should remain in effect, be modified or be revoked. The hearing shall
be conducted under the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(4) hereof.
      C.   An order issued under this paragraph shall contain only those terms
authorized in orders issued under paragraph (b)(4) hereof.
      D.   If a municipal court or a county court issues a temporary protection
order under this section and if, subsequent to the issuance of the order, the
alleged offender who is the subject of the order is bound over to the Court of
Common Pleas for prosecution of a felony arising out of the same activities as
those that were the basis of the complaint upon which the order is based,
notwithstanding the fact that the order was issued by a municipal court or
county court, the order shall remain in effect, as though it were an order of
the Court of Common Pleas, while the charges against the alleged offender are
pending in the Court of Common Pleas, for the period of time described in
paragraph (b)(8)B. hereof, and the Court of Common Pleas has exclusive
jurisdiction to modify the order issued by the municipal court or county court.
This paragraph applies when the alleged offender is bound over to the Court of
Common Pleas as a result of the person waiving a preliminary hearing on the
felony charge, as a result of the municipal court or county court having
determined at a preliminary hearing that there is probable cause to believe
that the felony has been committed and that the alleged offender committed it,
as a result of the alleged offender having been indicted for the felony, or in
any other manner.

agreement, arising out of the same activities as those that were the basis of
the complaint upon which the order is based, under Ohio R.C. 3113.31;
      C.   Shall not be construed as a finding that the alleged offender
committed the alleged offense, and shall not be introduced as evidence of the
commission of the offense at the trial of the alleged offender on the complaint
upon which the order is based.
   (9)   A person who meets the criteria for bail under Rule 46 of the Ohio
Rules of Criminal Procedure and who, if required to do so pursuant to that
Rule, executes or posts bond or deposits cash or securities as bail, shall not
be held in custody pending a hearing before the court on a motion requesting a
temporary protection order.
   (10)   The following regulations shall govern temporary protection orders:
      A.   A copy of any temporary protection order that is issued under this
section shall be issued by the court to the complainant, to the alleged victim,
to the person who requested the order, to the defendant, and to all law
enforcement agencies that have jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court
shall direct that a copy of the order be delivered to the defendant on the same
day that the order is entered. If a municipal court or a county court issues a
temporary protection order under this section, and if, subsequent to the
issuance of the order, the defendant who is the subject of the order is bound
over to the Court of Common Pleas for prosecution as described in paragraph (b)
(7)D. hereof, the municipal court or county court shall direct that a copy of
the order be delivered to the Court of Common Pleas to which the defendant is
bound over.
      B.   All law enforcement agencies shall establish and maintain an index
for the temporary protection orders delivered to the agencies pursuant to
paragraph (b)(10)A. hereof. With respect to each order delivered, each agency

temporary protection order under this subsection may provide notice of the
issuance of the temporary protection order to the judicial and law enforcement
officials in any county other than the county in which the order is issued by
registering that order in the other county in accordance with Ohio R.C. 3113.31
(N) and filing a copy of the registered protection order with a law enforcement
agency in the other county in accordance with that division.
        D.   Any officer of a law enforcement agency shall enforce a temporary
protection order issued by any court in this State in accordance with the
provisions of the order, including removing the defendant from the premises,
regardless of whether the order is registered in the county in which the
officer's agency has jurisdiction as authorized by paragraph (b)(10)C. hereof.
      (11)   Upon a violation of a temporary protection order, the court may
issue another temporary protection order, as a pretrial condition of release,
that modifies the terms of the order that was violated.
      (12)   As used in this paragraph, “defendant” means a person who is
alleged in a complaint to have committed a violation of the type described in

hereof, the officer responsible for public safety within the Municipality shall
designate, for purposes of subsection (d) hereof, the minimum number of
entrances required to be opened, maintained and staffed at each live
entertainment performance so as to permit crowd control and reduce congestion
at the entrances. The designation shall be based on such factors as the size
and nature of the crowd expected to attend the live entertainment performance,
the length of time prior to the live entertainment performance that crowds are
expected to congregate at the entrances and the amount of security provided at
the restricted entertainment area.
    (j)   Notwithstanding subsection (i) hereof, a State university law
enforcement officer appointed pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3345.04 and 3345.21 shall
designate the number of entrances required to be opened, maintained and staffed
in the case of a live entertainment performance that is held at a restricted

entertainment performance.

national directors, trustees or officers authorized, requested, commanded or
tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee or officer of
the organization who authorized, requested, commanded or tolerated the hazing.
If the hazing involves students in a primary, secondary or post-secondary
school, university, college or any other educational institution, an action may
also be brought against any administrator, employee or faculty member of the
school, university, college or other educational institution who knew or
reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable
attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college or other
educational institution. If an administrator, employee or faculty member is
found liable in a civil action for hazing, then notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2743, the school, university, college or other educational institution
that employed the administrator, employee or faculty member may also be held
liable.
   The negligence or consent of the plaintiff or any assumption of the risk by
the plaintiff is not a defense to an action brought pursuant to this section.
In an action against a school, university, college or other educational
institution, it is an affirmative defense that the school, university, college
or other institution was actively enforcing a policy against hazing at the time
the cause of action arose.

under paragraph (e)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair market

given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.

agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of

value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.

transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a

involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Section

risk that the offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting
the public from the risk, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the
history, character and condition of the offender and the offender's need for
correctional or rehabilitative treatment, any statement made by the victim
under Ohio R.C. 2930.12 to 2930.17, if the offense is a misdemeanor specified
in Ohio R.C. 2930.01(A), and the ability and resources of the offender and the
nature of the burden that payment of a fine will impose on the offender.
   (b)   The following do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered in favor of imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor:
      (1)   The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender;
      (2)   Regardless of whether or not the offender knew the age of the
victim, the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of age or older or
permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.
      (3)   The offense is a violation of Section
636.17 or Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a violation of Section
636.02 or Ohio R.C. 2903.13 involving a person who was a family or household
member at the time of the violation, the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children.
   If the offense is a violation of Section
636.17 or Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a violation of Section
636.02 or Ohio R.C. 2903.13 involving a person who was a family or household
member at the time of the violation and the court decides to impose a term of
imprisonment upon the offender, the factor listed in paragraph (b)(3) hereof
shall be considered in favor of imposing a longer term of imprisonment on the
offender.
    (c)   The criteria listed in Ohio R.C. 2929.12(C) and (E), that mitigate
the seriousness of the offense and that indicate that the offender is unlikely
to commit future crimes, do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered against imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (d)   The criteria listed in subsection (b) hereof and referred to in
subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed to limit the matters that may be
considered in determining whether to impose imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (e)   The court shall not impose a fine in addition to imprisonment for
misdemeanor, unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or
the correction of the offender, or the offense has proximately resulted in
physical harm to the person or property of another, or the offense was
committed for hire or for purpose of gain.
   (f)   The court shall not impose a fine or fines that, in the aggregate and
to the extent not suspended by the court, exceed the amount that the offender
is or will be able to pay by the method and within the time allowed without
undue hardship to the offender or the offender's dependents, or will prevent
the offender from making restitution or reparation to the victim of the
offender's offense.
   (g)   At the time of sentencing or as soon as possible after sentencing, the
court shall notify the victim of the offense of the victim's right to file an
application for an award of reparations pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2743.51 through
2743.72.
   (h)   As used in this section, “repeat offender” and “dangerous offender”
have the same meanings as in Section
698.01.

   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be
pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section defining the
offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2929.31)

a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04,
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender, and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively.
   When consecutive sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for
one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this section, the term
to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the
offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term
imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.
   (a)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when imprisonment is
imposed for a misdemeanor, the court may do any of the following:
      (1)   Suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2951.02;
      (2)   Suspend the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02 upon any terms
that the court considers appropriate;
      (3)   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, or on weekends, or both, or at any other
time or times that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's
occupation or care for the offender's family; or
      (4)   Require the offender to serve a portion of the offender's sentence,
which may be served in intermittent confinement, and suspend the balance of the
sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02 upon any terms that the court considers
appropriate or suspend the balance of the sentence and place the offender on
probation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02.
   (b)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when a term of
imprisonment is imposed for a violation of Section
636.17(a) or (c) involving a protection order issued or consent agreement
approved pursuant to Section
636.17(b) or Ohio R.C. 3113.31, and when the court has reason to believe, based
on an evaluation performed pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2919.271 or on the advice of a
chemical dependency professional, that the offender is a drug dependent person,
is in danger of becoming a drug dependent person, is an alcoholic, or is
suffering from acute alcohol intoxication, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.33, the
court may require the offender to serve a portion of the offender's sentence
and suspend the balance of the sentence and place the offender on probation
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02, with one of the conditions of probation being
that the offender enter into an appropriate treatment program or facility and
comply with the treatment prescribed at the program or facility. The court
shall order a person to enter a particular program or facility under this
subsection only if the court has received evidence that the program or facility
has space available and that the treatment provided by the program or facility
is appropriate. For purposes of this subsection, an appropriate treatment
program or facility includes a program licensed by the Ohio Director of Alcohol
and Drug Addiction Services pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.11, a program certified
by the Ohio Director of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3793.06, a public or private hospital, the Veterans Administration or
other agencies of the Federal Government, or private care or treatment rendered
by a physician or a psychologist licensed in the State, a licensed independent
social worker, a licensed professional clinical counselor or a certified
chemical dependency counselor. For purposes of this subsection, the fact that
an offender is a repeat offender, as defined in Section
698.01, shall not conclusively bar the offender from conditional probation
under this subsection if the previous offenses for which the offender was
imprisoned involved violations of Section
636.17(a) or (c) involving a protection order issued or consent agreement
approved pursuant to Section
636.17(b) or Ohio R.C. 3113.31, or equivalent violations of substantially
equivalent municipal ordinances, or violations of either of those sections had
they been in effect at the time of the violations.
   (c)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when a fine is imposed
for a misdemeanor, the court may do either of the following:
      (1)   Suspend all or any portion of the fine, upon any conditions that
the court imposes in the interests of justice and the correction and
rehabilitation of the offender; or
      (2)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the fine in installments,
or by any other method and in any time and on any terms that the court
considers just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment shall not
exceed two years. (ORC 2929.51)

offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of
this General Offenses Code that is substantially similar to a provision of the
Ohio Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to suspend or revoke a
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a violation of
that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties it is authorized by
law to impose upon the offender, may suspend the offender's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit for the period of time the court
determines appropriate, or may revoke the license or permit, but in no case
shall the period of suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of
this General Offenses Code exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or
required to be imposed for the violation of the provision of the Ohio Revised
Code to which the provision of this General Offenses Code is substantially
similar. (ORC 4507.1611)

taxable income of every person residing in and/or earning and/or receiving
income in Caldwell.
   Individuals.
   (a)   For residents of Caldwell, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
882.02(c)(16)).
   (b)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions,
and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (c)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "municipal
taxable income" as defined in Section
882.02(c)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer

receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   1.   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to Caldwell with respect to
any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            2.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to Caldwell each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         D.   "Refundable credit" means the amount of Caldwell income tax that
was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (2)   If, in addition to Caldwell, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to Caldwell
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in Caldwell
for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (e)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in Caldwell
for all or part of the taxable year.

the individual's residency;
         G.   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
         H.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with Caldwell.
For the purposes of this division, an individual has one contact period with
Caldwell if the individual is away overnight from the individual's abode
located outside of Caldwell and while away overnight from that abode spends at
least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in
Caldwell.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
   Businesses.
   (f)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in Caldwell, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
Caldwell or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone
company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C. Chapter
5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (f)(2) and (g) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of Caldwell shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in Caldwell for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Caldwell during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
               As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Caldwell to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
882.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Caldwell to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Caldwell, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
Caldwell may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion
of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving
one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
882.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
882.12(a).
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (f)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, and except
as provided in division (g) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall

purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in Caldwell if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within Caldwell from a
stock of goods located within Caldwell.
            2.   The property is delivered within Caldwell from a location
outside Caldwell, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within Caldwell and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within Caldwell to
purchasers outside Caldwell, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Caldwell to the extent that such services are performed in Caldwell.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of

         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Caldwell shall be sitused to Caldwell.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Caldwell based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Caldwell.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Caldwell's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Caldwell or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Caldwell. Caldwell shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to Caldwell, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in Caldwell
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of Caldwell shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for Caldwell. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under Caldwell's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (f)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)   [Left intentionally blank.]
      (9)   [Intentionally left blank.]
   (g)   (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is

            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is

         D.   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (g)(1)D.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;

or owner under division (g)(1)D.1. or 2. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (f) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
            A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
            The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
            After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies
to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
            Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (f)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (g)(2) of this section:
         A.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)A. of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)B. of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)C. of this section, and
notwithstanding division (f)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (f)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
882.04.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10- 9-17; Ord. 2024-04. Passed 3-11-24.)
882.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   Withholding Provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Caldwell shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Caldwell. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
882.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
882.03, of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct
and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer,
agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the
qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Caldwell the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Caldwell in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand three
hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes deducted
and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of Caldwell in
any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred dollars
($200.00).
         Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made so that
the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after
the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         C.   [Intentionally left blank.]
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Caldwell. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Caldwell as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Caldwell income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Caldwell the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Caldwell income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Caldwell until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Caldwell during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Caldwell income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this section, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
   Occasional Entrant - Withholding.
   (c)   (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of an
employer.
         B.   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
         If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee
spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for
or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
         For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (c)
(2)B. of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.
         D.   "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs services in
a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.
         E.   "Professional entertainer" means a person who performs services
in the professional performing arts for wages or other remuneration on a per-
event basis.
         F.   "Public figure" means a person of prominence who performs
services at discrete events, such as speeches, public appearances, or similar
events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
         G.   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
      (2)   A.   Subject to divisions (c)(3), (c)(5), (c)(6), and (c)(7) of
this section, an employer is not required to withhold Caldwell income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in Caldwell if the employee performed such services in Caldwell on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in Caldwell.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in Caldwell. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in
Caldwell at which the employer provides or provided services that can
reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than
20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the
employer to last more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the
time the services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of Caldwell and has requested that
the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in
Section
882.04.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in
Caldwell only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in Caldwell than in any other municipal corporation on
that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent
in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (c)
(2)B.3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Caldwell exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to Caldwell for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in Caldwell.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Caldwell under
division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for Caldwell for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in Caldwell.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Caldwell and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
882.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Caldwell, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside
the corporate boundaries of Caldwell.
      To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
882.04.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   An annual Caldwell income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
882.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due Caldwell.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for Caldwell income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives municipal taxable income taxable to Caldwell, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by Caldwell, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (e)   Caldwell shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and
Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
            A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Caldwell to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of R.C. § 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Caldwell. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Caldwell. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Caldwell's income tax
return. The extended due date of Caldwell's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of Caldwell's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Caldwell's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Caldwell income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date Caldwell
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of Caldwell's
income tax return. The extended due date of Caldwell's income tax return shall
be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Caldwell, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (g)(2), (g)(3), or (g)(4) of this section, the
tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
            If a tax administrator violates division (g)(5) of this section,
the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
            Division (g)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (g)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (g)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (g)(2)B. of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   Caldwell shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect
to net profits if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Caldwell for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with Caldwell an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section.
   (i)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
882.04(b)(1)A. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for Caldwell by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section 882.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by Caldwell,
unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to Caldwell and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by Caldwell to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Caldwell, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Caldwell
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of Caldwell's
income tax ordinance, resolution, and/or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Caldwell's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Caldwell for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by Caldwell during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to Caldwell before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by Caldwell in accordance with this
chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (p)(2)A. of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (p)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (r)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Caldwell's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Caldwell income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to Caldwell. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Caldwell income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated
Caldwell income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the
taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to
file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Caldwell income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
882.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's'' for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Caldwell income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
882.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Caldwell income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Caldwell. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Caldwell. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Caldwell;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Caldwell income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Caldwell income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Caldwell income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Caldwell in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.

882.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Caldwell who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not

715.691 or a joint economic development district created under R.C. § 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on
income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

882.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for Caldwell's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to Caldwell for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for Caldwell from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to Caldwell in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
882.05(g) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Caldwell, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the 15th day of the twelfth month of the taxable
year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with Section
882.05.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
882.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with Caldwell under Section
882.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Caldwell but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
882.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by Caldwell:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (c)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
882.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
882.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with Caldwell, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Caldwell as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Caldwell is subject to recovery by Caldwell. If
Caldwell's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Caldwell shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Caldwell claims is
due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid
to the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If Caldwell's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Caldwell's tax rate. However, if Caldwell's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Caldwell, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Caldwell changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Caldwell. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only.
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
882.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by Caldwell. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
882.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Caldwell's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Caldwell return showing income subject to
Caldwell income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Caldwell income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
      1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever
is later; or
      2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral period, if
any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
882.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
882.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Caldwell does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
882.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
882.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover Caldwell income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.13 AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C.
5703.056. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Caldwell official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
      "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
      Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
      If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)(1)A. of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Caldwell
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Caldwell that arises pursuant to Caldwell's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of Caldwell:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)
882.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Caldwell as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit Caldwell from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 10-9-17.)

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized

not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by Caldwell or for the withholding of such tax.

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter

the request was directed pursuant to Section
882.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section

identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under Section
882.19(c) within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
882.18.

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
882.99 for a violation of Section
882.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

Tree Plan, which shall specify the species of trees to be planted on each of
the streets or other public sites within the Village. From and after the
effective date of the Master Street Tree Plan or any amendment thereto, all
planting shall conform thereto. The Commission shall consider all existing and
future utilities (overhead and underground) and environmental factors when
recommending a specific species.
   (b)   (1)   No person shall plant, remove, or cut above ground any tree on
any treelawn, any tree on the land of another, or any tree on Village property,
for the purpose of construction or any other reason without first contacting

or cut a tree, the property owner shall bear said cost of removal or cutting,
including the cost of any stump removal.
      (2)   The Tree Commission may request that a new tree be planted at the
cost of the property owner or the old tree replaced at the cost of the property
owner. The property owner would also assume proper care, watering and
maintenance. The Tree Commission may require that a new tree be planted at the
cost of the property owner or the old tree replaced at the cost of the property

shall maintain, plant, or permit to remain on any private or public premises at
the intersection of two or more streets or alleys within the Village, any
hedge, tree, shrub, or other growth which may obstruct the view of the operator
of any motor vehicle approaching such intersection to the extent that such
operator is unable to observe other vehicles or pedestrians approaching or
crossing such intersection. Any such hedge, tree, shrub, or growth, if declared
to be a public nuisance, may be corrected by the Village.
      (5)   The Village shall have the right to order the removal of any trees,
plants, or shrubs within the right-of-way of all streets, alleys, avenues,
lanes, squares and public grounds, upon agreement with the Tree Commission, as
may be necessary to ensure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry
and beauty of such grounds. To protect the public safety can include when a
tree is in an unsafe condition, dangerous condition, or the tree is infected
with any injurious disease, insect or other pest and constitutes a hazard to
life and/or property. The property owner shall bear the cost of said removal
and shall complete said removal within 15 days after receiving notice of the
request for removal. In the event of failure of the property owner to comply
with such provisions, the Village shall have the authority to remove such
trees, plants, or shrubs and charge the cost of removal to the owner's property
tax notice. The Village shall give five days notice, by certified mail, to the

of such trimming or removal. Notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the
amount of cost incurred, and in the event the same is not paid within 30 days
after the mailing of such notice, then such amount shall be certified to the
County Auditor for collection of the same as other taxes and assessments are
collected. In the event this amount is not paid within 30 days after the
mailing and must be certified to the County Auditor, an additional charge of
ten dollars ($10.00) shall be assessed for the purpose of defraying the cost of
such certification.
   (c)   Unless specifically authorized by the Tree Commission, no person shall
intentionally damage, cut, or nail any advertising, signage, poster, or other
contrivance to any tree.
   (d)   Any new street developed in a subdivision by a private developer and
dedicated to the Village shall have a street tree plan approved by the
Committee.
   (e)   No person shall deposit, place, store, or maintain any stone, brick,
sand, fill dirt, concrete, or other materials which may impede the free passage
of water, air and/or nutrients to the roots of any public tree.
   (f)   The Tree Commission shall not be responsible for any damage caused to
sidewalks by tree roots. No property owner or person will cut or injure tree
roots in any way if replacing a sidewalk, without first contacting the Tree
Commission and obtaining their express permission.
   (g)   No person shall hinder, prevent, delay or interfere with the Tree
Commission while engaged in carrying out the execution or enforcement of this
chapter, provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as an
attempt to prohibit the pursuit of any remedy, legal or protection of property
rights by the owner of any property within the municipality.
   (h)   Village Council shall have the right to review the conduct, acts, and
decisions of the Tree Commission. Any person aggrieved or affected by any
ruling or order of the Tree Commission may appeal such ruling or order to

days of the issuance of such order or ruling, with the Village Clerk. The
notice of appeal shall state the date of the ruling or order appealed from and
shall attach a copy of such ruling or order to the notice of appeal. Council
shall hear and decide said appeal within 30 days after it is filed with the
Clerk.
   (i)   Should any section, clause or provision of this chapter be declared by
the courts to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the chapter
as a whole, other than the part so declared to be invalid.
   (j)   Any person, firm or corporation violating or failing to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
Any person, firm or corporation who violates or fails to comply as a second
offense shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Each day
of continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (k)   It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm or
company to top any street tree, park tree or other tree on public property.
“Topping” is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than
three inches in diameter within the trees’ crown to such a degree so as to
remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by
storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other
obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempted
from this chapter at the determination of the Tree Commission.

branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the Superintendent.
Where the public sewer is greater than twelve inches in diameter, and no
properly located “Y” branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the
public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream
direction at an angle of about forty-five degrees. A forty-five degree ell may
be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend
past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at
the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the
invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the
connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special
fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the
Superintendent.

1044.01 RATES.
   (a)   A rate for the Noble County Sewer District will be established to set
the sewer charge levied against the district for sewage brought to the Village
for treatment. As this service provided to the County does not require
maintenance of the line or lift stations by the Village, the rate will be the
same as the Inside the Corporation rate rather than the Outside the Corporation
rate. Effective with the September 1, 2021 billing for customers, water
companies and sewer districts, for supplying wastewater treatment services by
the wastewater treatment plant of the Village of Caldwell to consumers in the
Village and surrounding areas, the following rates shall be charged:
RATE PER MONTH INSIDE CORPORATION
   $3.33 service charge plus $8.03 per 1,000 gallons
RATE PER MONTH OUTSIDE CORPORATION
   $3.67 service charge plus $9.36 per 1,000 gallons
RATE PER MONTH COMPANY METERS
   $3.67 service charge plus $9.36 per 1,000 gallons
RATE PER MONTH NOBLE COUNTY SEWER DISTRICT
   $3.33 service charge plus $8.03 per 1,000 gallons
 
   (b)   The rates to be charged to future large industrial or commercial
users, whether within or without the Village, may be established by special
schedules or contracts to be determined by Council on the advice of the Board
of Trustees of Public Affairs, but in no event shall the covenant with the
holders of revenue bonds to maintain sufficient rates and charges be breached
by said contract rates.
(Ord. 89-8. Passed 11-9-89.)
   (c)   Effective January 1, 2024, all Village of Caldwell base rates for
sewer services shall increase two percent from their currently established
rate.
   (d)   All Village of Caldwell base rates for sewer services shall increase
an additional two percent on January 1 every calendar hereafter unless
otherwise altered by the Village of Caldwell by future legislative action.
   (e)   The Village Administrator and Clerk/Treasurer are hereby authorized
and directed to take any actions necessary to implement these increases.

1044.02 BILLING.
   (a)   The sewer charges levied at the rates established pursuant to Section
1044.01 shall take effect immediately. Said monthly rates shall be paid in
monthly installments. Said rates shall constitute a contract for the benefit of
the holders of sewerage system mortgage revenue bonds and shall be based and
computed upon the consumption of water according to the full meter reading by
each user, living unit or other unit of collection. Each dwelling or living
unit shall be considered a separate user. Said sewer charges shall be payable
at the office of the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs and shall be billed to
and paid by the users contemporaneously with the water bills. The payment for
the water bill will not be accepted without the payment of the sewer bill. Said
sewer charges shall be billed, together with the Village water charges, on the
first day of each month. All bills for sewer service shall become due by the
fifteenth of each month, except when the fifteenth falls on a Saturday or a
Sunday, or a holiday, in which case such bills shall then be due at the close
of business on the following day.
   (b)   A ten percent penalty shall be added to each bill after the due date.
This will be noted on each billing statement and will be collected by the Clerk
of the Water Department at the time of payment.
   (c)   The foregoing charges are minimum charges, not maximum charges, and
the Village reserves the right and is obligated to increase the same at any
time the revenues of the system prove insufficient to pay the operating and
maintenance expenses and debt service charges.
(Ord. 89-8. Passed 11-9-89; Ord. 2000-4. Passed 4-10-00.)
1044.03 DELINQUENT PAYMENTS.
   All accounts will be considered delinquent if not paid by the twenty-fifth
of each month. Unpaid accounts shall then be served with a turn-off notice and
shall then be turned off before the first of the following month. A twenty
dollar ($20.00) turn-on fee plus the account balance shall be paid, in full,
before service is restored. Any sewer bill which has been delinquent for more
than ninety days shall be certified to the County Auditor, shall become a lien
against the property served and shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as general taxes, as provided by State law.
(Ord. 78-12. Passed 9-5-78; Ord. 2000-4. Passed 4-10-00.)

ordinances of the Municipality or the laws of the State, shall have the same
force and effect as an ordinance of Council.
(Ord. 78-12. Passed 9-5-78.)
1044.06 CHARGES TO PARTIAL USERS.
   For any user served by the sewerage system directly or indirectly which is
not a user of water supplied by the Municipality, or is only a partial user
thereof, the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs shall determine the sewer
charges therefor, based upon the Board's judgment of the amount of water
discharged into the sewerage system, or the owner or other interested party, at
his or her expense, may install and maintain a meter acceptable to the Board of
Trustees of Public Affairs for the purpose of determining such sewer charge
established by Section
1044.01.
(Ord. 78-12. Passed 9-5-78.)
1044.07 CONNECTION FEES.
   (a)   The charges for connecting to the sewage lines within the Municipality

1044.09 REDUCTION OF BILLS IN THE EVENT OF WATER LEAKS.
   (a)   Leak Adjustment. If a residential customer experiences a leak or other
situation in higher than normal water consumption, and the customer can
establish that the water did not enter the sanitary sewer system, the customer
may petition the Village Administrator in writing and at his/her discretion,
adjust the sewer billing to the customers average usage. No allowance will be
made for water consumption. The customer retains responsibility for awareness
of the condition of his/her plumbing system, and this adjustment will only be
for one month's billing in any two-year time period. The types of leaks that
would be eligible for an adjustment may include service line leaks or leaks
inside walls. This adjustment does not apply to other types of leaks such as

1410.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION VILLAGE OF CALDWELL.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land, use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of the Village of Caldwell, State of Ohio, does ordain these flood
damage reduction regulations.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood- prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazard, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazard in other
areas.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Caldwell as identified in Section
1410.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:

these regulations.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

reasonable for regulatory purposes, and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Caldwell, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the

Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zone.” Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood
depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depth of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation (FPE).” The base flood elevation plus two
feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register.
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State, of Ohio, in accordance
with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine
flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood,
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric feature. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure, this definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. The insurance is designed to
provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating
costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial firm effective date of the Village of
Caldwell Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 4, 1987, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.

corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An “agency” is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
General Assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General's department or
any court.
    (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle-which is: (1) built on a single
chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection; (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light-duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.

professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.” Also known as “areas of special flood
hazard,” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. “Special flood hazard areas” may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided, the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.” A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas

   (ii)   “Substantial damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully complaint with these regulations.

(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.22 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA- identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1410.33 through
1410.38, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.23 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance claims.

1410.32 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD-CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses in minimized.
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation. Applicants must adhere to 120-foot setback from the
river bank.
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant.
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1410.21(a);
         B.   An elevation of alternatives which would not result in increased
base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are not
feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Caldwell and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1410.32(a)(2)A. and C. through E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bank-full
stage.” The field of determination of “bank-full stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all purposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bank-full flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bank-full, flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished, The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village, specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1410.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (d)   Compensatory Storage Required for Fill. Fill within the area of
special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
The volume of the loss of flood water storage due to filling in the special
flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage
by excavation or other compensatory measures in or adjacent to the development
site.
(Ord. 2005-05. Passed 12-12-05.)
1410.33 APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.

1410.36 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application tor a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal Regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought, shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
formation: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee by schedule adopted by Council.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearings. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold
a public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the dale of the hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and properly due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense; nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damage.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. Upon consideration of the above
factors and the purposes of these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of these regulations.
   (e)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in divisions (c)(1) to (c)(11) of
this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
