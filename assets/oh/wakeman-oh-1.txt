codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
 
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
 
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF WAKEMAN,
OHIO:
 
   SECTION 1. That the ordinances of the Village of Wakeman, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Wakeman, Ohio, 2008.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Fiscal Officer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Wakeman, Ohio.
 
   SECTION 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to August 11, 2008, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordnance except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued on incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment
or prosecution therefor.
For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall continue in full force
notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

ordinances existing prior to August 11, 2008, shall be deemed to amend, replace
or affect the analogous or comparable section of the Codified Ordinances as
reflected in the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as otherwise
indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.
   SECTION 4. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and to avoid
practical and legal entanglements.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

Officer and return to an elected office of Village Clerk-Treasurer by passing
an ordinance or resolution by a two-thirds vote.

employee shall be entitled to an initial combined pool of Sick/Personal Leave
credit of three workdays. In addition, each full-time employee shall earn Sick/
Personal Leave at the rate of one workday for each month of continuous service,
i.e., twelve workdays per year. In applying this rule, the employee shall be
credited with eight duty hours for each day of paid leave on which he would
have worked except for such leave.
      (2)    Sick Leave. Sick Leave for full time employees of the village with
full pay because of sickness may be granted and approved by the respective
department head or the Mayor. Sick leave for department heads with full pay
because of sickness may be granted and approved by the Mayor. Upon approval, a
full-time employee may use Sick leave due to his own illness, injury, or
exposure to contagious disease which might reasonably be expected to be
communicated to other employees, or for absence due to emergency caused by
illness of or injury to members of the employee's immediate family.
      (3)    Personal Leave. Personal Leave for full time employees of the
village with full pay because of any reason the employee deems personal may be
granted and approved by the respective department head or the Mayor. Personal
leave for departments heads with full pay because of any reason the employee
deems personal may be granted and approved by the Mayor.
      (4)    Sick/Personal Leave shall be used in no less than one-hour
increments.
      (5)    In cases in which a salaried employee is absent because of illness
for less than one full workday, his department head or the Mayor may permit him
to make up the lost time at a later date without loss or adjustment of pay.
   (b)    Approval.
      (1)    Three Workdays or Less. For periods of Sick/Personal Leave of
three workdays or less, the department head or Mayor may accept the employee's
statement as to reason for the absence or may require the employee to present
satisfactory written evidence of the existence of facts entitling the employee
to Sick/Personal Leave.
      (2)    More than Three Workdays. For periods of Sick/Personal Leave in
excess of three workdays, the department head or Mayor require a written
medical certificate or other acceptable written evidence. When an employee is
absent for more than three workdays as a result of illness or injury, his
department head may require a physical examination by a doctor designated by
the Village before the employee may return to work. If the Village doctor
confirms the employee's ability to return to regular work, he shall return to
work and shall be paid for the days missed between the date he would have
returned to work but for the scheduling of an examination by a Village doctor
and the time of the Village doctor's approval of return to work. But if the
Village doctor reports that the employee is not able to return to regular work,
he shall be continued on Sick/Personal Leave, or if has been exhausted, shall
continue on leave with no pay, until the Village doctor approves of his return.
      (3)    Seven Workdays or More. When an employee is absent for a period of
seven workdays or more on account of illness or injury (regardless of whether
such illness or injury is or is not covered by Workers' Compensation or Sick/
Personal Leave), his department head or Mayor may require him to submit written
evidence of his inability to return to work and may require an examination by a
doctor designated by the Village.
      (4)    It shall be the responsibility of the employee to determine from
his doctor, as far in advance as possible, the date of which his doctor
anticipates the employee will be able to return to work, or the date which may
be scheduled for a final physical examination, by the employee's doctor, prior
to the employee's return to work, and to notify his supervisor of this
anticipated date so the Village may schedule the physical examination with a
minimum loss of time. Should the employee have prior notice of the
aforementioned anticipated date of return to work, or of final physical
examination, and fail to notify his supervisor, the payment provided in the
preceding paragraph shall not apply.
   (c)    Holidays. An employee is not deemed to be on Sick/Personal Leave on a
day which is observed as his holiday.
   (d)    Workers' Compensation.
      (1)   The Village of Wakeman has elected to provide coverage for its
employees under the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 4123, the Workers'
Compensation Act. This benefit provides for compensation and payment of medical
expenses for every employee who receives an injury which the Industrial
Commission finds compensable.
      (2)   An employee may not use accumulated Sick/Personal Leave and also
collect industrial compensation. If an employee is going to be absent because
of a compensable industrial injury for a prolonged period of time, the employee
may request a Sick/Personal Leave savings agreement if he has accumulated Sick/
Personal Leave. Such an agreement provides that an injured employee may collect
his regular earnings in the form of Sick/Personal Leave for the period of time
which he is absent as a result of a compensable industrial injury. Such
earnings will continue to be paid until the employee's accumulated Sick/
Personal Leave is exhausted. The employee in turn agrees to pay to the Village
the amount of money which he receives from the Bureau of Workers' Compensation
for the time that he is absent due to such compensable injury. On payment by
the employee to the Village of the funds which the employee receives from the
Bureau of Workers' Compensation, the employee will regain Sick/Personal Leave
credit equal to the number of times his current daily earnings can be divided
into the amount of money which he receives from the Bureau of Workers'
Compensation and pays to the Village.
      (3)    The employee shall be permitted to use accumulated Sick/Personal
Leave for the time lost due to an industrial injury when the days lost are not
determined to be compensable by the Bureau of Workers' Compensation.
Accumulated Sick/Personal Leave may also be used for any time lost by the
employee because of leaving the job for treatment.
      (4)    The Village may provide transportation for an employee who is
injured on the job to and from the doctor's office or the hospital on the day
of the injury. If the doctor is of the opinion that the injured employee is
unable to return to work on the day of the injury, the employee shall receive
pay for the full day regardless of the hours worked prior to the injury, and
the day shall not be considered as or charged to Sick/Personal Leave.
   (e)    Each department head or the Mayor shall administer Sick/Personal
Leave within his department equitably, but with diligent regard for the fact
that the Village grants such leaves only to ease hardship and not as part of
the earnings of employment to which an employee is entitled as a matter of
right as he is to vacations. Sick/Personal Leave is not to be granted except
when an employee is unable to work because of illness or an accident or in
cases of sickness or any reason the employee deems personal or bereavement due
to death in the employee's family as set forth elsewhere in this section. Each
department head or the Mayor may require his employees to present written
evidence satisfactory to him of the existence of facts entitling such employees
to Sick/Personal Leave and may deny such leave for failure to present such
evidence.
   (f)    Unused Sick/personal Leave.
      (1)    An employee of the Village may elect at the time of retirement
from active service with the Village or voluntary termination of employment
while in good standing, if at such time the employee has three or more years of
service with the Village to be paid in cash for one-fourth of his total accrued
but unused Sick/Personal Leave credit, but not in excess of forty days at the
employee's wage or salary rate in effect at the time of retirement.
      (2)    Unused Sick/Personal Leave shall be cumulative from the day of
first employment by the Village with unlimited number of days.
   (g)    Bereavement Leave. In addition to the Sick/Personal Leave pool, each
full-time employee of the Village shall be entitled to separate Bereavement
Leave due to death in the employee's family as follows:
      (1)    Employee may be granted up to five workdays Bereavement leave upon
death of father, mother, husband, wife, domestic partner, son or daughter.
      (2)    Employee may be granted up to three workdays Bereavement leave for
death of grandparents, father-in-law, mother-in-law, foster-or stepparent,
brother, sister, son in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, or
grandchildren to attend the funeral.
   
   (h)    Definition(s).
      (1)    Immediate Family. For the purpose of this section, immediate
family shall mean spouse, parent, children and domestic partner.
      (2)    Domestic Partner. For the purposes of this section, "domestic
partners" are two individuals who:
         A.   Share a regular and permanent residence; and
         B.   Have a committed personal relationship for at least six months;

common carrier fares, vehicle parking, tolls, and all other reasonable and
necessary expenses incident to the travel when accompanied by a receipt subject

section; expenses incurred and charged on credit cards must be supported by
itemized receipts. No reimbursement shall be made for alcoholic beverages,
personal long distance telephone calls, expenses of entertainment, or expenses
incurred on behalf of any other individual for any reason.
   (b)   Lodging for one person authorized to travel under this section shall
be allowed at a rate which is established as the single room rate which is

181.04  DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Method of Determination. In the taxation of income which is subject to
municipal income taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a
business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the
municipality shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net
profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted
within the boundaries of the municipality, then only such portion shall be
considered as having taxable situs in the municipality for the purposes of
municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the municipality, in the
absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
municipality during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, “real property” includes property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business for services performed in the
municipality to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the forgoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   Sales Made in Municipality. As used in subsection (a)(3) above, “sales
made in the municipality” means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Wakeman, regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within the Village of Wakeman;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Wakeman, regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside the Village of Wakeman, if the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within the Village of Wakeman, and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village of Wakeman, to purchasers outside the taxpayer is not,
through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion
of sales at the place where delivery is made.
   (c)   Total Allocation. Add together the percentages determined in
accordance with subsections (1), (2), and (3) above or such of the aforesaid
percentages as are applicable to the particular taxpayer and divide the total
so obtained by the number of percentages used in deriving such total in order
to obtain the business allocation percentage referred to above.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the municipality.
   (d)   Rentals. Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
181.02(c), (d) and (e) , only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived
(whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part. Where the gross monthly rental of any and all
real properties, regardless of number and value, aggregate in excess of two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima facie evidence
that the rental, ownership, management or operation of such properties is a
business activity of such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property
shall be subject to tax; provided that in the case of commercial property, the
owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is
based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or
profits of the lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month; provided further that in the case of farm
property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he
shares in crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net
receipts derived from the farm whether or not the gross income exceeds said two
hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) per month; and provided further that the
person who operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business
whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month.
   (e)   Operating Loss Carry-Forward.  
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to the effective date of this title as set forth in Section
181.02 above, allocable to the municipality may be applied against the portion
of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the five taxable years
immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net
operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior years.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net
profits to the municipality.
      (3)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
         (Ord. 2003-0-32. Passed 10-13-03.)

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property

title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village
from a stock of goods located within the Village.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the Village from a
location outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Village and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.
      (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (l)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
182.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(l)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
         (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the location that
the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying
reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is
recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner
under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
182.04 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 2023-O-28. Passed 12-11-23.)
182.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.   
Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
182.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.03 of this chapter, of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.00.
   Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Village as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village's income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village's
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section. (Ord. 2017-0-24. Passed 12-11-17.)

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of

section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village's income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a

more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is in the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.04.

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of Village's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six- month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the state tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of
the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
the Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income
tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the

unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
            (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the
person does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
                        (i)    The person was required to file a tax return
with the Village for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g))
within the Village.
                       (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the
Village and does not expect to be subject to the Village income tax for the
taxable year.
                  (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed
affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the
location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the Village. The affidavit
shall also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to
perform any services within the Village, make any sales in the Village,or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Village during the taxable
year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the Village for
the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to
properly comply as a taxpayer with the Village income tax ordinance and rules
and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
                  (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division
(H)(3)(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax
return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information
that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the
affidavit change.
                  (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits
the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section 4 shall be allowed to the
taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by the
Village, unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the Village and the
recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with
the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter/ordinance and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village

in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or
a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called

filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election

the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated the
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated the
Village income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section 2 (C)(1) to the
extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment
has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the Village income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 5, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass- through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 5, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter/ordinance on
the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the Village income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the Village income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this
chapter/ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the
corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more
members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless

taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is

only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.10 SECOND VILLAGE IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another Village, is allowable by the Village as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another Village but should have
been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If the
Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other Municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first Village with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
Village, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the Village's
tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in
the other Municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to
be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
182.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015–23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipal official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other [Village/City/
Village] official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit Village from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Village ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud Village or the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-O-23. Passed 10-12-15.)

      (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

182.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the

         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
   (B)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or

subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Village, but
such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor
of the Village. This member may be an employee of the Village, but may not be

other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review of the Village

member appointed by the Mayor of the Village shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

303.083 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and

registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purpose of this section, “junk motor vehicle” defined as any
motorvehicle that is not currently registered and operable, defined as being
capable of operation on a public street and meeting all safety requirements for
such operation that is left covered or uncovered in the open on private
property for more than twenty-four consecutive hours with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property, except if the person
is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under
authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12; or regulated under authority of the
Municipality.
   (b)    No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle with the
permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property on
which the junk motor vehicle is left covered or uncovered in the open for more
than twenty-four consecutive hours. Junk motor vehicles and collector vehicles,
defined as any motor vehicle or agriculture tractor or traction engine that is
of special interest, that has a fair market value of one hundred dollars or
more, whether operable or not, and that is owned, operated, collected,
preserved, restored, maintained, or used essentially as a collector's item,
leisure pursuit, or investment, but not as the owner's principal means of
transportation, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   (c)    Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may
send notice by regular mail with a certificate of mailing certified mail with
return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession of
the property to which a junk motor vehicle is left for more than twenty-four
consecutive hours, that within five days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be housed in a garage or other suitable structure or
be removed from the property. Notice may also be given by leaving a copy of the
required notice at the residence of the person having the right to the
possession of the property to which a junk motor vehicle is left for more than
twenty-four consecutive hours, that within five days of receipt of the notice,
the junk motor vehicle either shall be housed in a garage or other suitable
structure or be removed from the property. The fact that a junk motor vehicle
is so left is prima facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the
notice.
   (d)   Each subsequent period of thirty days that a junk motor vehicle
continues to be so left constitutes a separate offense.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
   (f)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of this section, the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an unclassified
misdemeanor, the offender shall be fined no less than five hundred dollars but
no more than one thousand dollars.

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:

offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.

or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFICSIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

(ORC 4511.19)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or

(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical

subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the

         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled
substance in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00);
      (2)   For an offense committed on or after January 1, 2004, a fine not
exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), community service under division
(D) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, or a financial sanction other than a fine under Ohio
R.C. 2929.28.

against the Municipality and liberally construed in favor of the accused.
   (b)   Rules of criminal procedure and sections of the Ohio Revised Code
providing for criminal procedure shall be construed so as to effect the fair,
impartial, speedy and sure administration of justice.
   (c)   Any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code or of a division of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also refer to a

501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,

unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done
            to determine the extent of economic loss, the court may order
restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing
provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the
value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If
the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the court shall hold
an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, victim’s
representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate disputes
the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of full
restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.    For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.    For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.    For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.    For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

by.

licensee, and the owner of the devices will meet and attempt to amicably
resolve the situation. If the property owner or resident, licensee, and the
owner can reach an amicable solution, the Chief of Police will direct the
licensee to comply with the solution in his notice of reconciliation.
   (g)   If the parties cannot agree upon an amicable solution to the problem,

925.02 are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the
Village or to any sewer system, tributary thereto, the Village shall have the
following powers to:
      (1)    Prohibit the discharge of such waste water.
      (2)    Require a discharger to demonstrate that implant modification will
control, reduce, or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity
with this chapter. This may include control over the quantities and rates of
discharge.
      (3)    Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics
or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and
regulations.
      (4)    Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to
pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the Village for handling and
reading excess loads imposed on treatment system.
      (5)    Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable
or necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter. All industrial wastes
discharged to the public sewers by major contributing industries shall as a
minimum meet the national pretreatment standards or best practical control
technology currently available for incompatible pollutants as published in the
latest Federal Register, unless the Village is committed, in its NPDES permit
to remove a specified percentage of the incompatible pollutant. In those
instances the applicable pretreatment standards may be correspondingly reduced
to levels determined by the engineer, Superintendent, or his duly authorized
representative or any State Regulatory agency having such authority.
   (b)   Special Condition. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern for purposes of waste water treatment.
Within 30 days of a execution of said special agreement or arrangement, any
such special agreement may be appealed to the Village Council by any industrial
concern significantly affected thereby. Before a determination on said appeal
is made, the engineer or Superintendent shall make written recommendations as
to compliance or noncompliance of said agreement or arrangement with the
requirements of this chapter.After passage of this chapter, each person whose
operation entails the discharge of industrialwastes to a public sewer shall
prepare and file with the Village a written statement setting forth the nature
of the operation contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and source of
water required for use, the proposed point of discharge of said wastes into the
waste water collection systems of the Village, subject of possible payment
therefore by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment, the estimated
amount to be so discharged and a fair statement setting forth the expected
bacterial, physical, chemical, and other known characteristics and said wastes.
Within a reasonable time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty of
the Village to make an order stating such minimum restrictions as in the
judgment of the engineer or Superintendent deem necessary to adequately guard
against unlawful uses of the Village’s waste water system. Any industrial
concern may appeal to the Village Council any determination made by the
engineer or Superintendent on the enforcement of this ordinance within 30 days
of the date said determination was effected.
   (c)    Submission of Plans. Where pretreatment of equalization of waste
water flows prior to discharge into any part of the waste water treatment
system is required, plans, specifications, other pertinent date or information,
including, installation of facilities and equipment relating to such
pretreatment or flow control facilities shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Superintendent. Such approval shall not exempt the discharge or
such facilities from compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations
or additions to such pretreatment or flow control facilities shall not be made
without due notice to and prior approval of the Superintendent.
   Grease and oil interceptors for grease, oil and inorganic materials such as
sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the
engineer or Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in
Section
925.02, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that
such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
engineer or Superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and
disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain
records for the Superintendent. Any removal and hauling of the collected
materials shall be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (d)    Pretreatment Facilities Operation. If pretreatment of control of
waste flow is required, such facilities shall be continuously maintained in
good working order and operated as effectively and efficiently as possible by
the owner or operator at his own cost and expense, subject to the requirements
of these rules and regulations. Activities shall comply with Federal Law CFR
403.
   (e)    Admission to Property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the
purposes of these rules and regulations, the Superintendent, upon the

the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this chapter or any subsequent ordinance.
   (g)    Reporting of Accidental Discharge. If, for any reason, a facility
does not comply with or will be unable to comply with any prohibition of
limitations in this chapter, the facility responsible for such discharge shall
immediately notify the Superintendent so that corrective action may be taken to
protect the treatment system. In addition, a written report addressed to the
Superintendent detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge,
the quantity and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken
to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the responsible industrial
facility within five days of the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. 2005-O-1. Passed 3-14-05.)
925.05  INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (a)   Discharge Reports.
      (1)   Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic discharge
report at such intervals as are designated by the Superintendent. The
Superintendent may require any other industrial users discharging or proposing
to discharge into the treatment system to file such periodic reports.
      (2)   The discharge report shall include, but, in the discretion of the
Superintendent, shall not be limited to, nature or process, volume, rate flows,
mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation, concentrations
of controlled pollutants or other information which relates to the generation
of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical constituents and quantity
of liquid materials stored on site even though they are not normally
discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the Superintendent may require
information in the form of self monitoring reports.
   (b)   Records and Monitoring.
      (1)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge waste
water to the waste water treatment systems shall flow, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this chapter and any applicable state or Federal pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (2)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Superintendent. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data indicating the industrial
user’s compliance with this chapter shall be prepared as requested and
submitted to the Superintendent.
      (3)   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own cost and expense
suitable control manholes or access points, and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of waste. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, times, durations, and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by
the Superintendent.
      (4)   Waste water volume determination. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial waste surcharges shall be metered water consumption of the
person except as herein provided in this paragraph.
   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of this water from sources other than a metered, public water
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer, the person
shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type approved by
the engineer or Superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of
water obtained from those other sources. Access to these meters shall be made
available to representative of the Village of any reasonable time. The accuracy
of said meters shall be verified at the discharger’s expense on a once per two
year basis at a minimum or at the request of the Superintendent, by an
independent testing company.
   The engineer or Superintendent may require the installation of devices for
measuring the volume of waste discharge if volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records. Any metering devices for
determining the volume of waste discharge to the public sewer shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person responsible for its discharge
following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the
consent of the engineer or Superintendent.
      (5)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user’s premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Superintendent may
allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or
sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (6)   Whether constructed on public or private property the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Superintendent’s
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)   Inspection, Sampling and Analysis.
      (1)   Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect to
Section
925.02 prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples to composite samples of waste water. Composite
samples may be taken over a 24 hour period, or over a longer or shorter time
span as determined necessary by the Superintendent to meet the needs of
specific circumstances.
   Sampling and monitoring industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers
shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of said wastes. The testing will be performed as often as may be
deemed necessary by the engineer or Superintendent but in no case less than two
24 hour composite samples per month. The owner shall be responsible for the
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the
composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use of
automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples. Access to
sampling locations shall be granted to the engineer or his authorized
representative or Superintendent at all tines. Every care shall be exercised in
the collection of samples to insure preservation in a state comparable to that
at the time the same was taken.
      (2)   Analysis of industrial waste water. Laboratory analysis of
industrial waste water samples shall be performed in accordance with the
current edition of “Standard Method” of the “Methods for Chemical Analysis of
Water and Waste” published by the U.S. EPA. Analysis of those pollutants not
covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the State EPA. However, alternative methods for certain analysis
of industrial waste may be used subject to mutual agreement between the
engineer or Superintendent and the person responsible for its discharge.
Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial waste shall
be made by the person responsible for the discharge, or his qualified agent as
approved by the engineer or Superintendent. The results of the analyses shall
be reported to the Village on a monthly basis on forms provided by the Village.
The Village shall make its own analyses on the waste and these determinations
shall be binding as a basis for charges, except under circumstances in the
following paragraph. Testing standards shall comply with Federal Law 40 CFR
136.
   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village results in
substantially different values, and effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own samples. The
result of the analyses on the samples collected by the Village and the industry
shall be computed using the same testing procedure as outlined in the latest
edition of “Standard Methods” and the differences negotiated.
         (Ord. 95-3. Passed 2-13-95.)
925.06 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   Rates Inside Village Corporation Limits. The service charges shall be
calculated on the volume of waste water discharged directly or indirectly into
the sewage system and shall be measured by the water used by each sewer user as
shown by the water meter readings. The sewer service charges shall be
calculated, on an annual basis, using a formula provided by the Village
Engineer, and shall include the current year final appropriations as the basis
for the formula. In the event the current year final appropriations are not
available at the time the calculation is made, the estimated current year
appropriations shall be used as the basis for the formula.
   The sewer user charge for service inside the Village corporation limits
shall consist of a minimum charge of $22.00 per month per 1000 gallons of tank
capacity discharge unit. For the first 2,000 gallons used and an OM&R
(Operation, Maintenance & Repair) variable charge of $7.00 per 1000 gallons of
water used, for amounts in excess of the 2,000 gallons.
   In addition, the minimum charge shall begin to accrue and be billed to the
customer at the time the water meter installed.
   (b)   Rates Outside Village Corporate Limits. The sewer rental charge for
service outside the Village corporation limits shall pay the rate established
and approved prior to receiving wastes and levied to equalize local capital
costs by the Village of Wakeman.
   The sewer user charge for service outside the Village corporation limits
shall consist of a minimum charge of $22.00 per month per 1000 gallons of tank
capacity discharge unit, for the first 2,000 gallons used and an OM&R variable
charge of $9.00 per 1000 gallons of water used, for amounts in excess of the
2,000 gallons.
   (c)   Where a private water supply is used, the sewer user charge may be
calculated by requiring the property owner to meter the private water supply,
such metering to be at the property owner’s expense and such measurement to be
used in the same manner as a public water meter in determining the charge. The
Village Administrator may, in lieu of such metering, apply a sewer charge of
$46.00 per month to such premises. Each residence, institution, commercial or
industrial establishment may be subject to a separate sewer user charge even
though such establishment may be served by another sewer. If any water or waste
discharge measured or metered is greater than a customer is actually
discharging directly or indirectly into the sewage system, the Village
Administrator may modify and adjust such volume in accordance with the facts
and with what justice and equity requires, but no charge less than the minimum
shall be made for any customer subject to the sewer charge.
   (d)   Annual Audit and Review. The sewer charge system will be audited
annually by the Village Administrator and Council with the charges being
adjusted upwards or downwards in order to assure that the system is and will
continue to be self-sufficient and that sufficient revenue is being generated
from each user class in the proper proportions. No free service shall be
provided in this service charge system unless mandated by Ohio law. Each user
will be notified by the Village, at least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill, of the rates for that year and that portion of the service charge
which is attributable to the user charge for operation, maintenance, and
replacement of the system. In addition, rates will be reviewed and adjusted
accordingly to compensate users of each class for any overage or underage
accumulated during the previous rate period.

1.17    WATER MAIN TESTING
Disinfection - All new waterlines shall be disinfected in accordance with
procedures outlined in AWWA C651. As previously specified, all pipe interiors
shall be cleaned before laying and shall be kept clean thereafter. Chlorination
may be accomplished by the continuous feed method or the slug method.
After a main has been completed, it shall be filled with the portable water
from the public supply while exhausting air from the other end and at
intermediate places along the main, i.e., at the fire hydrants and corporation
stops installed at the extremities of the main for this purpose. After filling,
the residual chlorine strength of the solution of clean water and chlorine in
the main shall be determined. All filling operations must be conducted under
the supervision of the Project Inspector.
 
Sterilization can be accomplished with a solution of clean water and chlorine
having a residual strength of 50ppm. The solution shall be tested at the
extremities of the main and at the intermediate points to make sure the
solution has the required strength. If the solution in the main contains less
than 50ppm chlorine, a solution of clean water and chlorine having residual
strength of 50ppm shall be pumped into the main from a cleaned and sterilized
container, while exhausting the existing solution shall remain in the main for
at least 12 hours to assure complete sterilization.
 
During the sterilizing process, the main shall be isolated from existing
adjacent mains and extreme care shall be used to prevent the pressure in the
main from rising about 20 psi. This low pressure is to prevent and possibility
of highly chlorinated water from entering adjacent water mains which are in
service. After the main has been filled with the chlorine solution, the
existing solution, until a chlorine residual of 50 ppm is obtained throughout
the main.
 
After sterilizing the main, it shall be thoroughly flushed with potable water
from the public supply until the water in the main has approximately the same
chlorine content as water in the existing mains. Bacteriological samples shall
not be taken for testing until the main has been tested for leakage.
 
When the water runs clear, shut off the main and let the water remain in the
pipe for at least three (3) days. At the end of at least three (3) days, flush
out the entire contents of the main. Care shall be taken during this operation
to completely remove the old water from the main. After this is done, shut off
the main and let water remain in the pipe for 24 hours. After 24 hours, an
employee of the Village of Wakeman will test the water for a determination of
the alkalinity and pH. In case the alkalinity and pH are not satisfactory, the
main shall be flushed again to remove the old water. After this is done, shut
off the main and let the water remain in the pipe for at least four (4) hours.
At the end of at least four (4) hours, repeat until the alkalinity and pH are
approved by the Village of Wakeman.
 
In all cases, tests for chlorine content shall be in accordance with DPD test
in APHA Standard Methods, 16th Edition, (1985).
 
The Contractor shall furnish all materials, corporation stops, labor and
equipment required to sterilize the main.
1.18    PRESSURE AND LEAKAGE TESTS
All new waterlines shall be pressure and leakage tested in accordance with
procedures outlined in AWWA C600-87. When a main has been sterilized and
flushed, a leakage test shall be applied to it The main shall remain isolated
from adjacent mains and a pressure of at least 150 pounds per square inch shall
be applied by pumping clean water containing 10 ppm chlorine from a cleaned and
sterilized container through" a 1 inch corporation stop installed in the ends
of the main, with the Contractor to provide an initial pressure of 150-160 psi.
The pressure test shall be started in an afternoon and the pressure shall be on
for 18 hours and then the pressure shall be maintained at 150 psi or more for
an additional 6 hours by pumping water from the container. A minimum test
pressure of the 6 hours period the water shall be measured and the loss by
leakage shall not exceed that as determined by the formula:
               L= S x D x (P)½
                133,200
in which the L is the allowable leakage in gallons per hour; S is the length in
feet of main line being tested; D is the nominal diameter of the pipe in
inches; and P is the average test during the leakage test in pounds per square
inch gage.
 
When Hydrants are in the test section the test shall be made against the closed
hydrant.
 
Pressure testing of each side of the intermediate valves shall be done at this
time by shutting each valve and exhausting the pressure on one side and then
applying the test pressure of 150 psi or more to the main on the opposite side
of the valve. This procedure shall be repeated for each intermediate valve.
If the main valves do not pass leakage test the leak or leaks shall be located
and repaired and the testing procedure repeated.
 
Upon completion of the leakage tests, the main shall be thoroughly flushed with
potable water from the public supply until water in the main has approximately
the same chlorine content as water in the existing main.
 
The Contractor shall furnish all materials, labor and equipment for testing.
1.19    BACTERIOLOGICAL TESTS
After a water main has been sterilized and tested for leakage, bacteriological
samples shall be collected from the extremities and intermediate points along
the main by an employee of the Village of Wakeman experienced in the taking of
water samples. Bacteriological samples shall not be taken by the Contractor.
 
If results of two consecutive sets of bacteriological tests show the water to
be safe, the main may be placed in service. If bacteriological results show the
water to be unsafe the main shall be completely sterilized and retested again.
Sterilizing of the main is the responsibility of the Contractor who shall
provide all necessary materials and labor and the main will not be placed in
service and accepted until the bacterial quality of water has been approved by
the Village of Wakeman. The Village of Wakeman will perform two sets of
bacteriological tests at no charge to the Contractor. Additional tests will be
at the expense of the Contractor.
 
After the bacteriological tests are satisfactory, a representative of the
Village of Wakeman will open all valves to place the line in service.
1.20    COMPLETION OF TEST

1107.01 GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (a)   The regulations in this chapter shall control the manner in which
streets, lots, and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land.
These design controls shall help insure convenience and safe streets, the
creation of usable lots, the provision of space for public utilities, and the
reservation of land for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and
functional neighborhoods shall be promoted minimizing the undesirable features
of unplanned haphazard growth.
   (b)   The Village Planning Commission has the responsibility for reviewing
the design of each future subdivision early in its design development. The
Commission shall insure that all of the requirements of this chapter are met.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.02 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   (a)   The Arrangement, character, and location of all arterial and collector
thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the Major Thoroughfare
Plan and Comprehensive Plan. Thoroughfares not contained in the aforementioned
plan shall conform to the recommendation of the Commission based upon the
design standards set forth in Sections
1107.03 through
1107.13, inclusive.
   (b)   In addition, no final plat of land within the are in which an existing
zoning resolution is in effect shall be approved unless it conforms with such
resolution.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.03 GENERAL LAYOUT OF STREETS.
   (a)   Cul-de-sacs and loop streets are encouraged so that through traffic on
residential streets is minimized. Similarly, to the extent practicable,
driveway access to collectors streets shall be minimized to facilitate the free
flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards.
   (b)   Residential driveway access shall not be permitted to regional, major
or secondary thoroughfares as designated on the major thoroughfare plan and the
comprehensive plan for major subdivisions.
   (c)   Half streets (i.e. streets of less than the full required right-of way
and pavement width) shall not be permitted except where such streets, when
combined with a similar street (developed previously or simultaneously) on
property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or comprises a street that meets
the right-of-way and pavement requirement.
   (d)   Street shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed
1,000 feet, unless no other practicable alternative is available. (Ord. 2000-0-
02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.04 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable
for subdivision development considering but not limited to flooding, poor
drainage, topography, soils, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal,
transportation facilities, and other such conditions which may endanger health,
life, or property and, if from investigations conducted by the public agencies
concerned it is determined that in the best interest of the public the land
should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not
approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are advanced by the
subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by the development of
the land.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.05 STREET DESIGN.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade construction, and location
of all streets shall conform to the major thoroughfare plan. All streets shall
be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical
conditions, public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of the land to
be served by such streets. The circulation pattern shall discourage thorough
traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The subdivider shall provide, within
the boundaries of the subdivision plat, the necessary right-of-way for the
widening, continuance, or alignment of such streets in conformity with the
Major Thoroughfare Plan. The Commission reserves the right to disapprove any
street plan which does not insure continuity of existing street systems.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.06 STREETS DESIGN STANDARDS FOR CUL-DE-SACS.
   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 1,000 feet measured to the
center of the radius of the turnaround unless otherwise approved by the
Commission. The terminal shall be a circular area with a minimum radius of 42
feet measured from a point on the street centerline.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.07  RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR ALL STREETS.
   The rights-of-way for thoroughfares shall be in accordance with the major
thoroughfare plan, and the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
 
Street Type               R/W width (feet)
Arterial/main street      60
Local collector street  60
Residential street        60
Special streets:           
Cul-de-sac             42 (radius)

Arterial/main collector streets 300
Residential streets             100
   (b)   A minimum tangent of at least 100 feet shall be provided between
reversed curves on all residential street; greater tangential lengths shall be
required on collector and arterial streets and other high order thoroughfares.
   (c)   The Commission may modify the aforementioned minimum standards in the
following situations:
      (1)   When a collector or residential street’s lines deflect from each
other at any point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve
with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet or
with such greater radius as the Commission may deem necessary for the
particular situation.
      (2)   For arterial streets, curves with radii adequate to insure longer
sight distances may be required by the Commission.
         (Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)

1107.10 INTERSECTION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles
as topography or other limiting factors will permit.
   (b)   No intersection or streets at angles less than eighty degrees shall be
approved unless justified by extreme topographical conditions. In such a case,
special provisions as deemed necessary by the Commission shall be made in
designing the intersection to afford a satisfactory sighting of approaching
vehicles from each intersecting street.
   (c)   Residential street intersections shall be rounded with a thirty foot
radius measured at the back of curbs, if such intersections occur at right
angles. Under the same condition and measured similarly, all other
intersections shall be founded with a radius deemed appropriate by the
Commission. If an intersection at an angle less than thirty degrees in
unavoidable, the radius of curvature shall be such as to allow vehicles,
especially trucks and buses, to make right turns and proceed in the proper lane
without crossing the centerline of a two land thoroughfare.
   (d)   Street jogs at intersections with centerline offsets shall be avoided.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.11  SPECIAL STREET TYPES.
   The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
   (a)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets shall be permitted only as a segment of a continuing street plan
subject to extension into undeveloped acreage. Temporary dead-end street shall
extend to the boundary of such undeveloped acreage and shall be provided with
an interim turnaround satisfactory to the Commission in design. The Commission
shall reserve the right to limit the length of such a dead-end street based on
principles of proper planning, and the Commission may require a street along
the boundary between a proposed subdivision and the undeveloped acreage to
provide for future development.
   (b)   The dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. If a parcel
to be subdivided exists adjacent to a dedicated or platted and recorded half-
width street or alley, the other half-width of such street or alley falling
within the proposed subdivision shall be platted, providing that in the opinion
of the Commission such right-of-way is necessary for the proper development of
the area.
   (c)   Easement or reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except where deemed necessary by the Commission and where their
control is definitely placed with the County.
   (d)   In subdividing land along existing streets or roads and within a
proposed subdivision, provisions for the dedication of land for one or more
access streets to undeveloped land not fronting on an existing street or road
shall be incorporated. Said access streets shall be spaced not less than 800
feet nor more than 1,400 feet apart.
   (e)   Alleys shall not be approved in subdivisions except where justified by
extreme conditions.
   (f)   In subdividing land along regional, major or secondary thoroughfares,
as designated on the major thoroughfare plan, access should be limited by
incorporating one of the following into design of the subdivision:
      (Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.12  STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISION.
   Streets in commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be so planned as to
minimize conflict between vehicular and pedestrian movement. Such streets shall
connect with arterial streets so as not to generate excess traffic on
residential streets. The Commission may require marginal access streets in such
subdivisions to provide maximum safety and convenience.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.13  STREET VACATION.
   The Commission shall not recommend the vacation of any street dedicated to
and accepted by the public if such vacation will adversely affect the proper
functioning of the existing street system or any future street plans prepared
by, or approved by Commission.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.14 NAME OF STREETS.
   (a)   Name of streets shall not duplicate nor by confusingly similar to the
name of any other street or business in the Village. New streets which are
extensions of, or in alignment with existing streets shall bear the name of the
existing streets.
   (b)   All new streets shall be named in the following manner, subject to the
approval of the Commission

size and character required by this chapter and any applicable zoning
resolution, to provide for adequate opportunities of topography.
   (c)   Irregularly-shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs and loop
streets, and those containing interior park playgrounds may be approved by the
Commission, if properly designed and located.
   (d)   Where blocks are more than 900 feet in length, a crosswalk easement
not less than ten feet in width at or near the halfway point of the block may
be required.

general and specific concerns of the comprehensive plan and standards
established by the consulting engineer. Design shall be based on
environmentally sound site planning and engineering techniques.
   (b)   The best available technology shall be used to minimize off-site storm
water runoff, increase on-site infiltration, encourage natural filtration
function, simulate natural drainage systems, and minimize off site discharge of
pollutants to ground and surface water. Best available technology may include
measures such as retention basins, recharge trenches, porous paving and piping,
contour terraces and swales.
   (c)   The subdivider or developer shall provide the necessary means to
assure complete drainage in and adjacent to his property.
   (d)   When necessary, outlet ditches of closed sewers of an approved type
and size shall be required as part of the construction. If same is across
private property, rights-of-way or easements must be obtained by the subdivider
or developer for the construction and future maintenance. These rights-of-way
or easements shall be shown on the construction plans. Two copies of the above
easement shall be furnished to the Village Council.
   (e)   Upon request by the village planning commission, the subdivider or
developer will submit a topographical plan of storm drainage improvement, with
all areas shown that are tributary to the improvement.
   (f)   The preferred runoff patter shall be towards the street. The design of
streets and grading shall be such that runoff from roofs driveways and other
impervious surfaces will be collected in ditches or gutters in short funs 300
feet to 400 feet in length. The runoff shall than be diverted from the surface
into storm sewers or a natural watercourse. Street shall be located away from
watercourses unless storm sewers are to be installed.
   (g)   The subdivider shall guard against the creation or continuation of
swampy areas or stagnant pools. The Commission may require fill, swale, or
channel improvements in order to forestall such problems.
   (h)   Adequate measures for the protection of open and closed drainage
channels shall be provided. Maintenance easements of up to 75 feet from the top
of the bank on open channels, and up to 50 feet from the centerline of the
conduit for closed channels, shall be required by the consulting engineer.
   (i)   Open watercourses through the platted subdivision shall be cleaned.
The bottom shall be dipped of sediment and a uniform width constructed. The
side slopes shall be cleaned of brush an sloped to no steeper than 2:1 and
seeded.
   (j)   The channel downstream of the subdivision shall be improved adequately
by the developer to convey the storm runoff from the subdivision and across the
adjacent property owner so that damages from flooding are minimized. Property
lines shall be so designed as to follow drainage easements, except that such
easements may cross lots larger that one acre.
   (k)   No water course shall be altered in such a way as to change the amount
of direction of flow; no fill, building, or structures shall be situated in
natural water courses unless provision is made for the flow of water in a
manner satisfactory to the consulting engineer.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.19 PUBLIC SITES, OPEN SPACES AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   (a)   Where a park, playground, school, public access to water frontage, or
other public uses, which are contained within the comprehensive plan, are
located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, the Commission shall
request the dedication of such area within the subdivision or that provision be
made for the acquisition of such area by the proper agency within a period of
two years or other mutually accepted period.
   (b)   The Commission in conjunction with the Village Council may require
land to the amount of three percent (3%) of the land included in the plan of
the subdivision be conveyed to the Village for park purposes. In lieu of the
conveyance for park purposes, the Commission may in conjunction with the
Village require the subdivider to pay one hundred dollars ($100.00) per lot
created by the subdivision to be used for improvements to park land in the
Village. Upon the sale of the first lot within the subdivision, the subdivider
shall pay the Village five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the first five lots.
The above shall be repeated for each group of five lots or part thereof. If
less than five lots are to be developed, the amount to be paid shall be one
hundred dollars ($100.00) per lot for the total number of lots less than five.
   (c)   Where a large scale subdivision or planned unit development is
proposed, the Commission may require the consideration be given to sites for
parks, playgrounds, and other such areas for common use and that provisions be
made for such reservation or acquisition by the proper agency.
   (d)   The Commission may reserve the right to deny approval to a subdivision
if such a subdivision disregards the preservation of natural features which add
value to a residential development and the community, such as wooded areas,
water courses, beaches, areas of natural or historical significance and similar
irreplaceable assets as described in the comprehensive plan.
(Ord. 2000-0-02. Passed 1-24-00.)
1107.20 SOIL EROSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   In the development of a subdivision, the developer shall not cause or
allow earth-disturbing activities on a development area, except to comply by
minimizing or preventing soil erosion that can impair a public or private
surface ditch, subsurface drainage, stream, river or lake; nor shall excessive
amounts of sediment be deposited onto an adjoining property. Adequate controls
of sail erosion and sedimentation, through the use of best management practices
through both temporary and permanent measures, shall be used during all phases
of clearing, grading, and construction to conserve soil resources and to insure
no significant change in water quality.
   (b)   When a proposed development area consists of five or more acres and
earth-disturbing activities are proposed for the whole area or any part
thereof, the owner of record shall develop and submit for review a soil erosion
and sedimentation control plan. Such a plan shall contain sufficient
information, drawings and notes to describe how soil erosion and off-site
sedimentation will be kept to a minimum, both during and after construction.
   (c)   When a proposed development area involves less than five acres, it is
not necessary to submit a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan; however,
the responsible person must comply with the above standards of subsection (a)
hereof. Upon request, submittal of specific soil erosion and sedimentation
prevention measures to be or being implemented may be required to determine
compliance.
   (d)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be certified by a
professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio before submitted to the
Commission for review and approval.

including all parking area entrances and exits, and parking spaces. Parking

warrant, further limit the number of driveways into and out of a development to
maintain better traffic flow on the public street, require additional
buffering, or yard requirements, to maintain a better separation of pedestrian
and traffic movement, and may require greater building setbacks to achieve more
desirable and safer pedestrian and traffic movement. As a condition of
approval, the Planning Commission may, as circumstances warrant, require a bond
or letter of credit to guarantee completion of the improvements as shown on the

be granted until all improvements shown on a site plan are made. (Ord. 2000-0-

1127.02(b) for additional yard and buffering requirements.
      (3)   Minimum side yard depth 10 feet, see Section
1127.02(b) for additional yard and buffering requirements.
      (4)   Height regulations. No building shall exceed 35 feet in height
except for the accessory structures including but not limited to radio towers,
antennas, flag poles and chimneys.
   (e)   Industrial Performance Standards.
      (1)   Intent. It is the intent of these regulations to prevent land or
buildings from being used or occupied in any manner so as to create any
dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive,
radioactive or other hazardous condition, noise or vibration, smoke, dust, odor
or other form of air pollution; electrical or other disturbance; glare or heat,
liquid or solid refuse or wastes; conditions conducive to the breeding of
rodents or insects; or other substance, condition or elements (all referred to
herein as “Dangerous or Objectionable Elements”) in a manner or amount as to
adversely affect the surrounding area. All uses shall operate in conformance
with the limitations set forth in each division below.
      (2)   Vibration. No vibration shall be produced which is transmitted
through the ground and discernible without the aid of instruments at any point
beyond the lot line; nor shall any vibration produced exceed 0.002g peak
measured at or beyond the lot line using either seismic or electronic vibration
measuring equipment.
      (3)   Noise. (Per the State Health Department and the following)
         A.   All noise shall be muffled so as not to be objectionable due to
intermittence, beat frequency or shrillness. In no event, shall the sound-
pressure level of noise radiated continuously from a facility at nighttime
exceed at the lot line the values given in Table I (set out hereafter) in any
octave band of frequency. However, where the lot lines adjoin or lie within 25
feet of the    boundary of a residential district the sound- pressure levels of
noise radiated at nighttime shall not exceed at the lot line the values given
in Table II (set out hereafter) in any octave band of frequency. The sound-
pressure level shall be measured with a Sound Level Meter and an Octave Band
Analyzer that conforms to specifications published by the American Standards
Association (American Standards Sound Level Meters of Noise and other Sounds,
Z24.3-1944, American Standards Association, Inc., New York, N.Y. and American
Standards specification for an Octave Band Filter Set for the Analysis of Noise
and other Sounds, Z24.10-1953, American Standards, Inc., New York, N.Y. shall

      (4)   Air pollution. (Per State EPA requirements and the following):
         A.   Visible emissions. There shall not be discharged into the
atmosphere from any source any air pollutant in excess of the darkness
limitations listed below. This shall include emissions of air pollutant of such
opacity as to obscure an observer’s view to a degree equal to or greater than
do the visible emissions described below. Visible emissions of any kind at
ground level past the lot line of the property on which the source of the
emission is located are prohibited. No. 1 on the Ringelmann Chart at all times,
except upon demonstration that the emission contains less than one tenth pound
of particulate matter per thousand pounds of dry gases, adjusted to twelve
percent (12%) carbon dioxide or fifty percent (50%) excess air.
         B.   Materials handling. No person shall cause or permit any materials
to be handled, transported, or stored in a manner which allows or may allow
particulate matter to become airborne.
         C.   Particulate matter. There shall not be discharged into the
atmosphere any particulate matter in excess of the quantities shown below;
            1.   From refuse burning equipment, per 1,000 pounds of dry gases,
adjusted to twelve percent (12%) co2 or fifty percent (50%) excess air, 65/100
pound for capacities of 200 pounds per hour or less than 30/100 pound for
capacities of over 200 pounds per hour. In any one period this shall not exceed
250 pounds. Refuse shall not be burned in fuel- burning equipment.
            2.   From fuel-burning equipment, 6/10 pound per million BTU input
for installations using less than 10,000,000 BTU per hour total input. For
installations using more than 10,000,000 BTU per hour total input, the
allowable particulate emission, in pounds per million BTU, is determined by
multiplying 8.58 times the input, in BTU per hour, raised to the minus 0.165
power (E = 8.58 1-165).
         D.   Threshold value. There shall not be discharged into the
atmosphere any contaminant for which threshold limit values are listed for
working atmosphere by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial
Hygienists in such quantity that the concentration of the contaminant at ground
level at any point beyond the boundary of the property shall at any time exceed
the threshold limit.
      (5)   Odors. Any condition or operation which results in the creation of
odors of such intensity and character as to be detrimental to the health and
welfare of the public or which interferes unreasonably with the comfort of the
public shall be removed, stopped or so modified as to remove the odor.
      (6)   Fire and explosion. All activities and all storage of flammable and
explosive materials at any point shall be provided with adequate safety and
fire fighting devices in accordance with the Fire Prevention Codes.
      (7)   Radioactive materials. The handling of radioactive materials, the
discharge of such materials into the air and water, and disposal of radioactive
wastes, shall be in conformance with the regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) and the State of Ohio.
      (8)   Glare and heat. There shall be no direct or sky-reflected glare
visible at the lot lines nor glare from lights or high temperature processes
such as welding or combustion.
      (9)   Non-radioactive liquid or solid wastes. There shall be no discharge
at any point into any public or private sewage disposal system or stream, or
into the ground, of any liquid or solid materials except in accordance with the
regulations of the Village of Wakeman, Huron County and the State of Ohio.
   (f)   Prohibition of Outside Storage.
      (1)   All uses of land except as herein provided shall take place within
a wholly enclosed structure, except that this shall not be construed to include
the parking of motorized vehicles.
      (2)   An area of the lot may be used for the purpose of storing
manufactured products and materials awaiting processing provided such area is
completely enclosed by a solid fence with no apertures of a height equal to the
height of the highest point of stored materials or products.
         (Ord. 2000-0-03. Passed 3-13-00.)
1131.07  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT(PUD) DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) is to
achieve, to the greatest possible degree, land development which is responsive
to the natural and environmental assets and liabilities of a given site. The
PUD should be a well-integrated development in terms of major design elements
such as roads, drainage systems, utilities, and open space. The PUD also allows
greater design flexibility so that natural features may be protected and
development concentrated in an innovative and efficient manner.
   (b)   General Requirements. A PUD may be located in any area of the village
where the applicant can demonstrate that a proposed development would meet the
purpose of this section. The tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD
must be owned, leased, or controlled by one person or single entity, and must
be at least ten continuous acres in size.
   (c)   Permitted and Conditional Uses. A developer may propose to include any
mixture of land uses which are listed as being permitted or conditionally
permitted in any zoning district, with the following limitations: The proposed
location of commercial uses shall not have an adverse impact upon adjacent
property or the public health, safety, and morals. Not more than thirty-five
percent (35%) of the gross acres in a proposed development may be devoted to
commercial uses. Further, not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross
acres in a proposed development may be devoted to dwellings which are not
detached single-family dwellings.
   (d)   Development Standards. The following standards represent broad
parameters under which all PUD developments must be designed:
      (1)   Central water and sewer facilities. All developments approved as a
PUD must have central water facilities approved by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency or be served by public water and sewer facilities.
      (2)   Clustering residential development and density. Clustering
residential development is encouraged to provide required common open space.
Overall, the area devoted to residential land uses shall have a maximum overall
density of three dwelling units per acre of land (net acres, excluding roads).
This overall density may however, be clustered in particular areas of the
development to a level of up to ten dwelling units per net acre in any given
area, provided however, that no less than forty percent (40%) of the site is
devoted to useful and desirable common open space established to provide
recreational opportunities and to preserve unique environmental features on the
site.
      (3)   Maximum impervious surface. For all areas proposed for residential
uses in the development the amount of impervious surface proposed must not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total developed residential area. For all
areas proposed for commercial uses in the development, the amount of impervious
surface proposed must not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the total
commercial area. Impervious surfaces include but are not limited to, parking
areas, loading areas, and rooftops.
      (4)   Development layout and design. Specific residential density as well
as the development intensity of non-residential uses and the development design
and layout shall be based on the applicant’s ability to provide sufficient
evidence to the Planning Commission and the Village Council that the overall
development demonstrates excellence in design by properly considering:
significant natural and historic features, topography, natural drainage
patterns, roadway access and circulation, surrounding land uses, the
enhancement of the general welfare of the public, and aesthetically desirable
land development. Attractive landscape buffers shall be provided between
incompatible land use and activities.
      (5)   Front, side and rear setback standards for perimeter lots. All lots
which are located along the perimeter of the PUD shall have minimum front, side
and rear setbacks equal to those which would normally be specified in the
applicable conventional zoning district for the particular land use.
      (6)   Common Space. A minimum of forty percent (40%) of the gross acres
developed in the PUD shall be reserved for common open space for the residents
of the area. This required amount of common space shall be established as open
space forever and provisions shall be established for maintenance and care. The
legal articles relating to any organization of property owners in the
development charged with such open space maintenance is subject to review and
approval by the village. The Village Planning Commission and/or Village Council
may require as a condition of final approval, any evidence deemed necessary to
document that the required common space will remain in its stated condition
forever (including such legal documents as deed restrictions, conservation
easements etc.)
      (7)   Front, side, and rear setback standards for interior lots. Within
the PUD, the standards for setbacks shall be fully described in the proposed
preliminary and final development plan submitted in accordance with the
requirements of this section.
      (8)   Off-street parking and loading facilities. For all land uses
located within the PUD, the parking and loading standards contained in Section
1131.10 shall be applied.
   (e)   General Pud Approval Procedure. The applicant for a PUD must submit
both a preliminary plan and a final development plan. Property must also be
rezoned to PUD and the decision to approve a final development plan and to
rezone a property PUD are done concurrently. The final development plan,
together with all conditions, stipulations, and requirements become the zoning
requirements for that particular property. All development restrictions
described in the final development plan and supporting documents become the
official zoning requirements of the subject property.
   (f)   Preliminary Development Plan Submission. The applicant shall submit
ten copies of a proposed preliminary plan to the Zoning Inspector along with
the required application fee. The proposed preliminary development plan shall
include the following:
      (1)   Background information.
         A.   Name, address and phone number of the applicant;
         B.   Name and address of the registered surveyor, engineer and/or
landscape architect who prepared the plan;

         G.   A description of proposed ownership and maintenance of open
space;
         H.   A description of the expected timing of the development;
         I.   A list of property owners within 500 feet of the proposed
development;
      (2)   Plan drawing.
         A.   A vicinity map;
         B.    A table showing the gross acreage devoted to various uses;
         C.    Location, type and density of development types;
         D.    Conceptual drainage plan;
         E.    Location of open spaces;
         F.    Buffers between incompatible land uses;
         G.    Proposed street layout;
         H.   Existing buildings, and any existing potential underground
storage tanks; and
         I.   Overlay maps showing topography in two foot increments (derived
from field survey or aerial photography), and soil types.
      (3)   Additional information and fees. The Village Planning Commission
may require additional information such as maps, data, or reports including
environmental impact studies. The applicant shall be responsible for all
reasonable expenses incurred by the village in reviewing the preliminary and
final development plans or any modifications thereof. Such expenses are in
addition to the application fees established by Village Council and may include
professional service fees such as legal fees and the fees for the services of
other professionals such as geologists, landscape architects, planners,
engineers, environmental scientists, or architects, incurred in connection with
reviewing the plans and prepared reports.
   (g)   Preliminary Plan Review. Within 30 days following the submission of
the required information, a public hearing shall be scheduled on the proposed
plan. Notice of this hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation at least 15 days prior to such hearing. Notice of this hearing
shall also be sent to all property owners within 500 feet of the proposed
development.
   (h)   Preliminary Development Plan Review as a Subdivision. Concurrently,
with the PUD review procedure described herein, all PUD developments must also
be reviewed as a subdivision pursuant to Sections
1105.02 to
1105.08. Where possible, reviews and hearings will be held concurrently in
order to facilitate timely action on proposed developments. Whenever the
requirements of this section conflict with requirements contained in the
Subdivision Regulations, the stricter of the two shall apply.
   (i)   Criteria for Approval of a Preliminary Development Plan. Within 20
days following the public hearing referenced in subsection (h) hereof, the
Village Planning Commission shall act to approve, disapprove or conditionally
approve the preliminary plan in accordance with the following criteria.
      (1)   That the proposed development is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the Wakeman Village Council, a copy of which is available for
inspection at the Fiscal Officer’s office;
      (2)   That the benefits, improved arrangement, and the design of the
proposed development justify the deviation from standard development
requirements included in the Zoning Code;
      (3)   That the uses requested in the proposal are compatible with
surrounding land uses;
      (4)   That there are adequate public services (e.g. utilities, fire
protection, emergency service, etc.) available to serve the proposed
development;
      (5)   That the proposed development will not create overcrowding or
traffic hazards on existing roads or intersections;
      (6)   That the arrangement of land uses on the site properly consider
topography, significant natural features, natural drainage patterns, views, and
roadway access;
      (7)   That the clustering of development sites are shown to preserve any
natural or historic features and provide usable common open space;
      (8)   That the proposed road circulation system is integrated and
coordinated to include a hierarchical interconnection of interior roads as well
as adequate outer-connection of interior collector streets with off-site road
systems;
      (9)   That there are adequate buffers between incompatible land uses;
      (10)   That the Village Planning Commission is satisfied that the
developer possesses the requisite financial resources to begin the project
within the required one year and complete the project within three years or
within the phasing schedule.
   (j)   Effect of Approval of the Preliminary Development Plan. The Planning
Commission approval of a preliminary plan will be considered an approval of the
preliminary development plan in principle only. Approval of the preliminary
plan does not, therefore, approve any development on the site nor shall it be
construed to absolutely endorse a precise location of uses, configuration of
parcels, or engineering feasibility. Approval of the preliminary development
plan is necessary however, before the applicant may submit a final development
plan to the Planning Commission and Village Council for approval and rezoning
to PUD.
   (k)   Final Plan. The applicant shall submit ten copies of the proposed
final plan to the Village Zoning Inspector along with the required application
fee. The final plan shall include the following:
      (1)   All of the written information required for the preliminary plan
application (see subsection (f) hereof) revised as necessary and;
         A.   The specific description of permitted, conditionally permitted
and accessory uses to be allowed in each area of the development;
         B.   A copy of proposed deed restrictions;
      (2)   In addition to the information provided on the preliminary plan,
the final plan shall be drawn to scale (1” to 100’) and include:
         A.   A survey of the proposed development site, showing dimensions and
bearings of the property lines; area in acres; topography; and existing
features of the development site, including major wooded areas, streets,
easements, utility lines, and land uses;
         B.   The location and dimensions of all lots, setbacks, and building
envelopes, as well as those of any primary and secondary leaching field
envelopes;
         C.   Engineering drawings and plans of sewer and water facilities as
well as street and drainage systems;
         D.   Landscaping plan for all buffers and other common areas;
         E.   Architectural guidelines to apply throughout the development;
         F.   The proposed names of all interior streets proposed for the
development; and
         G.   Layout and dimensions of all parking and loading areas along with
an indication of what they are to be built to serve.
   (l)   Final Plan and Rezoning Approval Procedure Process. The decision to
rezone land to PUD and to approve the final plan are technically separate
decisions. However, in order to provide for the efficient and timely processing
of both the rezoning request and the request for final plan approval, all PUD
final plan submittals are deemed to be an application for amendment to the
Zoning Code in accordance with Sections
1137.01 through
1137.10. All procedures (Planning Commission review, public hearing, and final
action by Council), therein shall be followed in considering an application for
a rezoning of the land in question to PUD. Upon approval of such application to
rezone the property in question to PUD, the zoning districts map of the village
shall be amended to designate the project area as “PUD”. Thereafter, with the
concurrent approval of the rezoning and final plan pursuant to the criteria
stated in division M below, all development restrictions and conditions
described in the final plan shall become official requirements of the PUD.
   (m)   Criteria of Approval – Final Plan. The Planning Commission and the
Village Council shall review the proposed final plan in accordance with the
following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed development is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the Wakeman Village Council;
      (2)   That the proposed development advances the general health and
safety of the Village;
      (3)   That the Planning Commission and Village Council are satisfied that
the developer possesses the requisite financial resources to begin the project
within the required one year and complete the project within three years or
within the phasing schedule;
      (4)   That the interior road system, proposed parking and any off-site
improvements are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic generated
by and within proposed development;
      (5)   That any exception from standard district requirements can be
warranted by design and other amenities incorporated in the final development
plan, in accordance with these PUD requirements;
      (6)   That the area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned
in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
and
      (7)   That the existing and proposed utilities, including water and sewer
service, and drainage plan will be adequate for the population densities and
non- residential uses proposed in the PUD.

1131.08 MANUFACTURED HOME.
   (a)   Purpose. The provisions of this section provide for the location and
regulation of manufactured home parks in order to foster their development and
maintenance as an integral and stable part of the community.
   (b)   Establishment Procedures. There is hereby created a Manufactured Home
Park District as a Special Zoning District. Manufactured home parks shall be
located only in the Manufactured Home Park District (MHP) and shall be
developed according to the standards and regulations stated herein. The
procedure to amend the official zoning map to establish the MHP District shall
be that procedure for amendments as set forth in Section
1129.01.
   (c)   Permitted Uses. In the MHP Zoning District, the following uses are
permitted:
      (1)   Mobile Home Parks;
      (2)   Mobile Homes;
      (3)   Parks, playgrounds and other recreational facilities for use by
mobile home park residents and their guests; and
      (4)   Accessory structures such as storage sheds.
   (d)   Area Regulations. 
      (1)   Minimum area. Minimum site size for manufactured home parks shall
be ten acres.
      (2)   Maximum density. Maximum density shall be seven units per acre.
      (3)   Minimum setback. A minimum setback of 50 feet from all property
shall be required for all buildings and structures.
      (4)   Minimum open space between units. A minimum open space of 20 feet
shall be maintained between each manufactured home unit in a MHP District. A
minimum open space of 20 feet shall also be maintained on all sides of each
unit.
   (e)   Approval Procedures. Manufactured home parks shall be located only in
the Manufactured Home Park District (MHP) and shall be developed according to
the standards and regulations stated herein.
   (f)   General Standards for Manufactured Home Parks. The Planning Commission
shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed
manufactured home park development in terms of the following standards and
shall find adequate evidence that such development meets these standards:
      (1)   The proposed park will be served adequately by essential public
facilities and services such as streets, drainage, refuse disposal, schools,
police and fire protection, or that the persons or agencies proposing the
establishment of the park shall be able to provide any such services
adequately;
      (2)   The vehicular approaches to the proposed park property shall be so
designed as not to create traffic interference or congestion on surrounding
public streets or roads;
      (3)   The establishment of the proposed park will not result in the
damage, destruction, or loss of any natural, scenic, or historic features of
the Village; and
      (4)   The establishment of the proposed park shall not be detrimental to
the value of surrounding properties or the character of the neighborhood or
adjacent neighborhoods.
   (g)   Manufactured Home Park Requirements. All manufactured home parks shall

promulgated by the Ohio Public Health Council in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3733.
(Ord. 2000-0-03. Passed 3-13-00.)
1131.09  NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the
continuations of uses and structures that do no conform to this existing Zoning
Code, but were lawfully existing at the time of enactment of this chapter.
   (b)   Nonconforming Uses. The lawful use of any building or land existing at
the effective date of Ordinance 2000-0-03 may be continued although such use
does not conform with the provisions of this Zoning Code, provided the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   Alterations. A nonconforming building or structure may not be
altered, improved or reconstructed, enlarges or extended, except as outlined in
subsection (c) below.
      (2)   Nonconforming to nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may be
changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed nonconforming
use is in less conflict with the character and use of the district than the
existing nonconforming use as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Construction approved prior to ordinance. Nothing in this chapter
shall prohibit the completion of construction and use of nonconforming building
for which a zoning certificate has been issued prior to the effective date of
Ordinance 2000-0-03, provided that construction is commenced within 90 days
after the issuance of such certificate; that construction is carried on
diligently and without interruption for a continuous period in excess of 30
days; and that the entire building shall have been completed within one year
after the issuance of said zoning certificate.
      (4)   Displacement. No nonconforming use shall be extended to displace a
conforming use.
      (5)   Discontinuance or abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use has
been discontinued for a period of two years or more, such discontinuance shall
be conclusive evidence of an intention to abandon legally the nonconforming
use. At the end of that two-year period of abandonment the nonconforming use
shall not be re-established, and any further use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of the Zoning Code.
      (6)   Unsafe structures. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of a building or
structure declared unsafe by a proper authority provided such work is not to an
extent exceeding in aggregate cost fifty percent (50%) of the replacement value
of the building or structure, unless the building or structure is changed to a
conforming use.
      (7)   Annual review of nonconforming uses. Each year, the Zoning
Inspector shall make an inspection of known nonconforming uses, and shall beep
records describing the activities taking place on the property, as well as the
conditions of the structure.
   
   (c)   Nonconforming Structures. A structure which was lawfully constructed
before the effective date of Ordinance 2000-0-03, and which is nonconforming
with respect to height, or setbacks from any lot lines, may be continued,
provided however, that if such structure is to be altered, expanded, enlarged
or otherwise structurally modified, such alteration, or enlargement shall not
increase the amount of nonconformity with this Zoning Code. For example, a
building which has a side yard of five feet in a Zoning District which requires
a ten-foot side yard, may not be enlarged upon so that the side of the building
abutting such non-conforming side yard is increased in length, unless any new
additions are built in conformity with the greater side yard requirement.
Nonconformity to area regulations shall be determined by the standards for the
appropriate district. Supplementary regulations (Section
1127.02) shall not apply to structures under this section.
   (d)   Nonconforming Lots. Whenever a parcel of land exists which is
nonconforming as to required lot size, then such lot may be built upon
individually. However, where an individual, group of individuals, corporations,
or other organizations own two or more lots abutting each other in such a way
as to permit compliance with lot size requirements of this chapter, then such

property owner, all improvements to the land cannot be made as shown on the
plans submitted for a zoning permit, such as parking lot landscaping, parking
lot paving, sidewalk construction, park improvements, tree planting or other
such improvements, an occupancy permit may still be issued provided a
completion of bond, letter of credit, or other form of security is posted with
the Village to guarantee the completion of such improvements. All such
guarantees shall be reviewed by the legal counsel for the Village, and
estimated cost for completion of the involved improvements shall be estimated
by a third party and approved by the Mayor. Any costs associated with

   (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear requests for variances to allow
deviation from the strict application of the dimensional requirements within a

authority to hear and decide upon requests for variances from measurable
development requirements such as yard dimensions, height limitations, lot
sizes, number of parking spaces required, etc. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
only grant such variances when it finds that a practical difficulty exists
using the following factors:
Specifically, the standards the Board of Zoning Appeals, will apply to an
application for an area variance, i.e., seeking relief from the strict letter
of area, height, setback and other similar requirements contained in the Zoning
Ordinance, to determine whether there are practical difficulties as follows:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)    Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (i.e. water, sewer, refuse disposal, etc.);
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with the
knowledge of the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner’s predicament can feasiblely be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance. (See Duncan
v. Middlefield [1986], 23 Ohio St. 3d 83)
         (Ord. 2000-0-03. Passed 3-13-00.)

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, and as
identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be liberally
construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official finds
that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved by
the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code shall
be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1309.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)    Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village of Wakeman, State of Ohio does ordain as
follows:
   (b)    Findings of Fact. The flood hazard areas of Village of Wakeman are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)    Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)    Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)    Meet community participation requirements of the national flood
insurance program.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.  In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. (Ord. 2010-0-26. Passed 12-13-10.)
1309.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus three (3) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Wakeman's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
the basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Wakeman
Flood Insurance Rate Map, effective January 19, 2011, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard," it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on
a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2010-0-26. Passed 12-13-10.)
1309.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of Wakeman
as identified herein, including any additional areas of special flood hazard
annexed by the Village of Wakeman.
   (b)    Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) #390288, effective January 19,
2011 and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report effective January 19, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include: n/a.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Wakeman as required by Section
 1309.05(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village of Wakeman Municipal Building, 59 Hyde
Street, Wakeman, Ohio.
   (c)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning or
building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations
shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the land subject
to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (d)    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (e)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Wakeman, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (f)    Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or
invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a
whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be
unconstitutional or invalid.

   (j)    Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village of Wakeman's flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1309.03 accurately represents flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1309.05(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j) above, prepared in a format required
for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and
submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one
foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
above.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Wakeman, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Wakeman have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Wakeman's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
of Wakeman's boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the Village of Wakeman suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Wakeman has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)    Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1309.06, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)    Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

and the bottom of all such openings being no higher than one foot above grade.
The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards set forth herein.
In AO Zones, new construction and substantial improvement shall have adequate
drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away
from the structure.
   (e)    Nonresidential Structures.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall meet the requirements of

1309.05(d)(1)-(3) and (5)-(7).
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to or above the level of the flood
protection elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall meet all of the following standards:
         A.   Be dry floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the
flood protection elevation;
         B.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and,
         C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect,

subsection (e)(2)A. and B. herein.
      (3)   In Zone AO areas with no elevations specified, the structure shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the
highest adjacent natural grade.
   (f)    Accessory Structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures containing no more than 600
square feet. Such structures must meet the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
      (6)   They shall meet the opening requirements of Section

1309.05(e).
   (h)    Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)    Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1309.04(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Wakeman and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1.0) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1309.05(j)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Wakeman specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1309.04(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2010-0-26. Passed 12-13-10.)
1309.06 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)    Appeals Board Established. The Council shall appoint an Appeals Board
consisting of the members of the Board of Zoning Appeals. The members shall
serve five year terms after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by
appointment by the Mayor with the advise and consent of the Council. Each
member shall serve until his/her successor is appointed.
   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board. Meetings
of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the call of
the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All meetings of the
Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board may deliberate
in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in accordance with
law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote
of each member upon each question and shall keep records of all official
actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the office of
the Village.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) of this
section.
   (c)    Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 14 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)    Variances. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Council.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing or posted at the 5 posting places in the Village designated by
Council for the publication of ordinances and resolutions.
      (3)   Public Hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)    Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
herein have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)    Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)    Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Huron County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2010-0-26. Passed 12-
13-10.)
1309.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Compliance Required. 
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1309.04(j).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection ( c) herein.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) herein.
   (b)    Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)    Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the State of Ohio. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the Village of Wakeman from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. The Village of Wakeman shall prosecute any
violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.
The issuance of a citation for a violation of this chapter shall not preclude
the Village of Wakeman from seeking injunctive relief and any other remedy it
may have available to it in the Huron County Court of Common Pleas or other
court of competent jurisdiction.

or punishment under any ordinance of the Village or law of the State of Ohio.
(Ord. 1998-0-23. Passed 11-9-98.)
1313.04 EXTERIOR MAINTENANCE.
   (a)    Scope. This chapter is strictly limited to the establishment of
minimum standards for the maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior
functioning units of all commercial and residential structures, buildings and
uses within the Village, including yard areas immediately contiguous thereto.
No provisions of this chapter shall, in any way, directly or indirectly, be
interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the right of, any owner or resident
to inhabit real property owned or leased by them in such manner and form as
they may determine appropriate, consistent with other applicable provisions of
law. This chapter is directed to obvious visual problems which may occasion
incipient blighting conditions within the Village. All matters of the interior
use, occupancy or habitation of any structure or building within the Village
are specifically excluded from the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)    Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health,
safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance,
appearance and exterior condition of all premises and uses throughout the
Village; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and residents
of the same as to both separate and correlative responsibilities and duties; to
authorize and establish procedures for the exterior inspection of such premises
and uses; to fix penalties for the violations of this section; and to provide
for the repair, demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use. This chapter is hereby declared to be remedial and essential
for the public interest, and it is intended that this chapter is construed and
interpreted to effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
   (c)    Applicability. Every building, occupancy or use shall comply with the
provisions of this chapter, whether or not such building or use shall have been
constructed, altered or repaired before or after the enactment of this chapter,
and without regard to any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for
the use or occupancy of the building premises, for the construction or repair
of the building or use, or for the installation or repair of equipment or
facilities prior to the effective date of this section. This section
establishes minimum standards for the initial and continued occupancy and use
of all such structures and does not replace or modify standards otherwise
established for the construction, repair, alteration or use of the building.
   (d)    Maintenance of Exterior of Premises. The exterior of the premises and
the exterior of all structures thereon shall be kept free of all nuisances,
unsanitary conditions and hazards to the safety of occupants, pedestrians and
other persons utilizing the premises, and any of the foregoing shall be
promptly removed and abated by the owner or operator. It shall be the duty of
the owner or operator to keep the premises free of hazards, which include, but
are not limited to, the following:
      (1)    Refuse. An accumulation of brush, broken glass, stumps and roots
that present a safety hazard, as well as garbage, trash and debris which
present an unsanitary and/or safety hazard.
      (2)    Natural Growth. Dead trees and limbs or other natural growth which
by reason of rotting or deteriorating conditions or storm damage, constitutes a
hazard to persons in the vicinity thereof.
      (3)    Overhangings and awnings. Loose and overhanging objects, which, by
reason of location above ground level, constitute a danger of falling on
persons in the vicinity thereof.
      (4)    Sources of infestation. The permitting of any premises to become
infested with vermin or rodents is hereby declared to be a nuisance and
unlawful. No owner, occupant or person in charge or control of any premises
shall cause or knowingly permit such premises to become or remain infested with
vermin or rodents.
      (5)    Foundation walls. Exterior foundation walls shall be free from
holes, defects and damage.
      (6)   Chimneys and all flue and vent attachments thereto. Chimneys and
all flue and vent attachments thereto shall be maintained structurally sound,
free from defects and such as to capably perform at times the functions for
which they were designed and to withstand any wind forces to which they may be
subjected.
      (7)    Gutters and downspouts. Rusted, broken, or damaged gutters and
downspouts shall be promptly repaired, replaced, or removed.
      (8)    Sidewalks. All sidewalks shall be kept in repair. Any grade
separation greater than one inch (1 in.) on the surface of a sidewalk caused by
cracks or settling shall be promptly replaced or repaired. Sidewalks, where
surfaces are eroded or pitted to such an extent to cause a safety hazard to
pedestrians, shall be repaired or replaced.
      (9)    Compost Piles. See Section
521.15 herein.
      (10)    Above ground pools. Above ground pools shall be drained and/or
covered or taken down when not in use during the off-season or for any other
extended period of time so as not to create a breeding ground for mosquitoes or
other nuisance.
   (e)    Appearance of Exterior of Premises and Structures. The exterior of
the premises, the exterior of structures, the exterior or dwelling structures,
and the condition of accessory structures shall be maintained by each owner or

   (a)    Inspection. All buildings, premises, and uses within the Village are
subject to exterior inspections from time to time by the zoning inspector or
other person designated by the Mayor hereinafter referred to as "enforcement
official."
   (b)   (1)   Notice. Where a violation of any provision of this chapter is
found to exist, the zoning inspector or enforcement official shall cause a
written notice of such violation to be served upon the person responsible for
the correction thereof. The notice shall specify the violation committed.
Within fourteen (14) days of the date of service of notice, a reasonable period
of time to correct or abate the violation shall be established, not to exceed
six months. Such reasonable period of time for the correction and abatement of
the violations shall be pursuant to a repair schedule submitted in writing by
the violator and approved by the zoning inspector or enforcement official. In
the event that weather is a major consideration in correcting or abating the
violation, the zoning inspector or enforcement official may extend the time set
out herein to not more than sixty (60) days immediately following the
occurrence of appropriate weather conditions.
      (2)    Notice shall be served by certified mail to the owner of the
property appearing on the current record of the county auditor and to the last
known address of the tenant to be served, if any. If the last known address of
the tenant cannot be ascertained, the notice shall be posted on the outside
front entrance of the structure in alleged violation.
      (3)    In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of
notice, and failure to comply, shall constitute a Final Order as to
administrative proceedings.
   (c)    (1)    Appeal. Within twenty-one (21) days of the date of service of
notice, any person affected by the notice may request a hearing thereof before
the Board of Zoning Appeals by filing a written request with the zoning
inspector or enforcement official. The zoning inspector or enforcement official
shall forward such request to the Board within three (3) days of receipt. The
Chairperson of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall set the matter
down for hearing within thirty (30) days, allowing at least five (5) days
notice to the party and the zoning inspector or enforcement official. The Board
of Zoning Appeals may sustain, modify or dismiss, in whole or in part any
action required to correct or abate the violation set forth in the notice and
shall issue an order incorporating its determinations, and such order shall be
a Final Order as to these administrative proceedings.
      (2)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider only the following in
determining appropriate action to be taken, to wit:
         A.    That any modification of the original order of the zoning
inspector or enforcement official shall not, in any material way, alter the
standards of this chapter and shall not affect detrimentally the health or
safety of occupants, or the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or
owners of adjacent premises or of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.    That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and
unnecessary hardship on the owner, manager or resident, by reason of compelling
an expenditure for repair of the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to the health, safety or welfare of the
community that might be derived therefrom.
      (3)    No license or permit or other certification of compliance with
this chapter shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other
local ordinance applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any
provision herein relieve any owner, manager or resident from complying with any
such other provision, nor any official of the Village from enforcing any such
other provision.
         (Ord. 2009-O-7. Passed 5-11-09.)
1313.06 UNOCCUPIED OR INOPERATIVE STRUCTURES AND UNOCCUPIED LOTS.

structure is located, as well as unoccupied lots, shalt be maintained in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Any such lot shall be provided
with grass or other appropriate ground cover or landscaping material so as to
assure absorption of rainfall and prevent erosion and rapid runoff of surface
water. The owner shall cut and maintain all grass or other ground cover and
remove all rubbish and weeds from the premises. The parking of motor vehicles
upon said premises shall be prohibited.
   (b)   If any structure or lot shall become unoccupied or inoperative and not
maintained according to provisions of this chapter for a period of more than
one hundred eighty (180) days, it shall be presumed to be a nuisance affecting
or endangering surrounding property values and to be detrimental to the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, property or general welfare of the
community and shall be abated.
   (c)   Whenever the Zoning Inspector shall find any structure to be
unoccupied and an inoperative nuisance as defined in subsection (b) above,
notice shall be given in the same manner as service of summons in civil cases
or by certified mail addressed to the owner of record of the premises at his
last known address or to the address to which tax bills are sent, or by a
combination of the foregoing methods, to abate such unoccupied or inoperative
nuisance condition within thirty days either by placing the structure in
operation in accordance with this section, adapting and using the structure for
another use permitted in the Zoning District or by razing the structure in
accordance with Chapter
1319, removing all debris, any signs, goods, supplies and equipment, and
filling depressions to the grade level of the lot, provided, however, that if
the structure is in use at the time notice is given and remaining in operation
for ninety consecutive days, the provisions of this section shall not apply.
   (d)   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the
notice to abate such unoccupied and inoperative nuisance, the Zoning Inspector
shall advise the Solicitor of all the facts and the Solicitor shall proceed to
exercise on behalf of the Village any remedy which shall then be available to
it to secure an abatement of such unoccupied or inoperative nuisance,
including, but not limited to, any remedy that pertains to the abatement of a
public nuisance, and to recover any damages or enforce any penalties which may
be recovered or imposed at the instance of the Village, including all damages
reasonable under Ohio R.C. 715.26 and 715.261. (Ord. 2013-0-13. Passed 8-12-

   (a)    Whenever the person responsible under Section
1313.04 with the maintenance of a structure or premises, or Section
1313.06 relative to unoccupied or inoperative structures and unoccupied lots,
or fails to comply with any Final Order as provided in this chapter, the Law
Director may file an action seeking injunctive relief or other remedies
provided by law. The pursuit of one remedy does not preclude the Law Director
from pursuing any and all other remedies available at law.
   (b)    Whoever violates any provision of this chapter, or fails to comply
with any Final Order as provided herein shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
minor misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day on
which a violation occurs or continues.
   (c)    Whoever violates any provision of this chapter, or fails to comply
with any Final Order as provided herein, on more than one subject matter in any
two (2) year period separate and distinct from a conviction upon a prior

within two (2) years shall be deemed committed each day on which a violation or
noncompliance occurs or continues.
