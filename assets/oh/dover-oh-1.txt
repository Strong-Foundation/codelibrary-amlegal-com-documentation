EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or

      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

   (a)    This section shall be liberally construed to require public officials
to take official action and to conduct all deliberations upon official business
only in open meetings, unless the subject matter is specifically excepted by
law.
   (b)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Public body" means any board, commission, committee, or similar
decision-making body of the City.
      (2)    "Meeting" means any prearranged discussion of the public business
of the public body by a majority of its members.
      (3)    "Regulated individual" means:
         A.    Any student in a state or local public educational institution;
         B.    Any person who is, voluntarily or involuntarily, an inmate,
patient, or resident of a state or local institution because of criminal
behavior, mental illness or retardation, disease, disability, age, or other
condition requiring custodial care.
   (c)    All meetings of any public body are declared to be public meetings
open to the public at all times.
   The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such Public Body shall be
promptly recorded and open to public inspection. The minutes need only reflect
the general subject matter of discussions in executive sessions authorized
under division (e) of this section.
   (d)    Every public body shall by rule, establish a reasonable method
whereby any person may determine the time and place of all regularly scheduled
meetings and the time, place, and purpose of all special meetings. A public
body shall not hold a special meeting unless it gives at least twenty-four
hours advance notice to the news media that have requested notification, except
in the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action, in the event
of an emergency, the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the
news media that have requested notification immediately of the time, place and
purpose of the meeting.
   The rule shall provide that any person may, upon request and payment of a
reasonable fee, obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings at which
any specific type of public business is to be discussed. Provisions for advance
notification may include, but are not limited to, mailing the agenda of
meetings to all subscribers on a mailing list or mailing notices in self-
addressed stamped envelopes provided by the person.
   (e)    The members of a public body may hold an executive session only at a
regular meeting for the sole purpose of the consideration of any of the
following matters:
      (1)    Unless the public employee, official, licensee, or regulated
individual requests a public hearing, to consider the appointment, employment,
dismissal, discipline, promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public
employee or official, or the investigation of charges or complaints against a
public employee, official, licensee, or regulated individual, except as
otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for
the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of
his official duties or for his removal from office.
      (2)    To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member shall use this division as a subterfuge for providing
covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of
public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public property has
received covert information from a member that has not been disclosed to the
general public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers and sellers to
prepare and submit offers.
      If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey,
lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any. public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance

the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
   (f)    A resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid unless
adopted in an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule or formal
action adopted in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting
not open to the public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose
specifically authorized in division (e) of this Section and conducted at an
executive session held in compliance with this section.
   Upon proof of a violation or threatened violation of this section in an
action brought by any person, the Court of Common Pleas shall issue an
injunction to compel the members of the public body to comply with its
provisions.
   A member who knowingly violates an injunction issued pursuant to this
division may be removed from office by an action brought in the Court of Common
Pleas for that purpose by the Prosecuting Attorney or the Attorney General.

establishes as its goal the employment of qualified members of all minorities,
as defined by the Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance,
throughout all areas of City employment.
   (b)   Equal Opportunity Clause in City Contracts. All contracts which are
funded exclusively by the City of Dover during any particular year shall
contain an equal employment opportunity clause which shall read as follows:
      (1)   The contractor shall not discriminate against any employee or
applicant for employment because of race, religion, color, sex or national
origin. The contractor shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants
are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard
to their race, religion, color, sex or national origin. As used herein, the
word "treated" includes but shall not be limited to recruitment by any means;
compensation direct or fringe benefits, or any other type of compensation;
selection for apprentice, promotion, demotion, transfer, lay off and
termination. The contractor agrees and shall post in a conspicuous place
notices of this policy of nondiscrimination.
      (2)   The contractor shall state in all solicitation or advertisements
for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor that all qualified
applicants shall receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
religion, color, sex or national origin.
      (3)   The contractor shall give notice of this equal opportunity to all
labor unions or representatives of workers with which he is doing business and
shall cause the posting of a notice of equal opportunity in a conspicuous
place.
      (4)   The contractor shall take such action with respect to any
subcontractor as the City may direct as a means of enforcing the provisions of
subsections (b)(1) through (12) hereof, including penalties and sanctions for
noncompliance; provided, however, that in the event the contractor becomes
involved in or is threatened with litigation as a result of such direction by
the City, the City shall enter into such litigation as is necessary to protect
the interests of the City and effectuate the City's equal employment
opportunity program.
      (5)   The contractor shall cause his subcontractors, if any, to follow
the same procedures following by him as provided herein.
      (6)   The contractor shall furnish all information and reports showing
compliance with this chapter and shall permit access to his books, records and
accounts by the Safety-Service Director to show compliance with this program.
      (7)   The contractor shall include the provisions of subsections (b)(1)
through (12) hereof in every subcontract or purchase order, so that such
provisions shall be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.
      (8)   Refusal by the contractor or subcontractor to comply with any
portion of this program as herein stated and described shall subject the
offending party to any or all of the following penalties:
         A.   Withholding of all future payments under the involved public
contract to the contractor in violation until it is determined that the
contractor or subcontractor is in compliance with the provisions of the
contract.
         B.   Refusal of all future bids for any public contract with the City
or any of its departments or divisions until such time as the contractor or
subcontractor demonstrates that he has established and shall carry out the
policies of the program as herein outlined;
         C.   Cancellation of the public contract and declaration of forfeiture
of the performance bond;
         D.   In cases in which there is substantial or material violation or
the threat of substantial or material violation of the compliance procedure or
as may be provided for by contract, appropriate proceedings may be brought to
enforce those provisions, including the enjoining, within applicable laws, of
contractors, subcontractors or other organizations, individuals or groups who
prevent directly, indirectly or seek to prevent directly or indirectly,
compliance with the policy as herein outlined.
      (9)   All notices to prospective bidders shall include the condition that
bidders shall be required to comply with the City's contract compliance program
regarding equal employment opportunity and each bidder shall file as part of
the bid documents such contract employment reports as may be directed by the
Safety-Service Director to show that the contractor is carrying out this
program.
      (10)   Upon review of the bids, the Safety-Service Director shall
determine whether or not the successful bidder has complied with this program.
      (11)   The reports required herein shall be submitted at the beginning

Affirmative Action Program:
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM
      The City of Dover wishes to promulgate an Affirmative Action Program for
the improvements of conditions for all people living within the City. Insofar
as it is able to enforce such a program, the City will use all efforts of
conciliation and recommendation to assist all of its residents in obtaining the
goals of equal opportunity. The City of Dover proclaims that action must be
taken to insure all people the right to that pursuit of happiness regardless of
their race or national origin over which they have no control or their
fundamental beliefs which should not be an impediment to their economic
abilities.
      The achievement of equal employment opportunities goals have been
suggested by Federal and State governmental units. The City of Dover therefore
wishes to express its program. It is the policy of this City in its own
employment and in its contractual agreements that all people shall have an
equal employment opportunity.
      It is the intent of the City to review this program from time to time to
see what, if any, changes are necessary.

   155.03 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE REGARDING HARASSMENT.

(Res. 29-94. Passed 11-21-94.)
   155.04 WAGES FOR CONTRACTUAL WORK SEPARATE FROM USUAL DUTIES.
   The City Auditor is authorized to pay employees of the City of Dover who are
performing work outside of their usual and customary job duties in the same
amount as contractors who perform this work who are not otherwise employees of
the City. From the amount so paid, the Auditor shall deduct all lawful or
required deductions required or customary for City employees and shall include
these sums paid and deductions made as part of the W-2's issued to the
employees.
(Ord. 35-10. Passed 6-21-10.)
   155.05 DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   (a)   In HB 523, Ohio adopted a comprehensive medical marijuana statutory
scheme to regulate the use, dispensing and employee use of medical marijuana.
The legislature in the statutory scheme allows cities in Ohio Revised Code
(ORC) Section 3796.28 to prohibit the use of medical marijuana by employees or
prospective employees of the City. That section provides:
Sec. 3796.28.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter does any of the following:
      (1)   Requires an employer to permit or accommodate an employee’s use,
possession, or distribution of medical marijuana;
      (2)   Prohibits an employer from refusing to hire, discharging,
disciplining, or otherwise taking an adverse employment action against a person
with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment
because of that person’s use, possession, or distribution of medical marijuana;
      (3)   Prohibits an employer from establishing and enforcing a drug
testing policy, drug-free workplace policy, or zero-tolerance drug policy;
      (4)   Interferes with any federal restrictions on employment, including
the regulations adopted by the United States Department of Transportation in
Sub. H.B. No. 523 131st G.A. 36 Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as
amended;
      (5)   Permits a person to commence a cause of action against an employer
for refusing to hire, discharging, disciplining, discriminating, retaliating,
or otherwise taking an adverse employment action against a person with respect
to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment related to
medical marijuana adopted by the administrator under Chapter 4123 of the
Revised Code.
   (B)   A person who is discharged from employment because of that person’s
use of medical marijuana shall be considered to have been discharged for just
cause for purposes of division (D) of Section 4141.29 of the Revised Code if
the person’s use of medical marijuana was in violation of an employer’s drug-
free workplace policy, zero-tolerance policy, or other formal program or policy
regulating the use of medical marijuana;
      (6)   Affects the authority of the administrator of workers’ compensation
to grant rebates or discounts on premium rates to employers that participate in
a drug-free workplace program established in accordance with rules.
   (b)   Pursuant to ORC Section 3796.28 (as enacted and amended in the
future), Dover reiterates its drug free workplace policy, adopts as if fully
rewritten hereinafter the provisions of ORC Section 3796.28, and specifically
allows and permits the City and administration to apply, enforce and continue
with its drug free workplace policies and use prohibitions and to enforce the
provisions as allowed by ORC Section 3796.28.
   (c)   ORC Section 3796.29 allows a municipality to prohibit marijuana
dispensaries with the City.
Said section specifically provides:
Sec. 3796.29. The legislative authority of a municipal corporation may adopt an
ordinance, or a board of township trustees may adopt a resolution, to prohibit,
or limit the number of, cultivators, processors, or retail dispensaries
licensed under this chapter within the municipal corporation or within the
unincorporated territory of the township, respectively. This section does not
authorize the legislative authority of a municipal corporation or a board of
township trustees to adopt an ordinance or resolution limiting research related
to marijuana conducted at a state university, academic medical center, or
private research and development organization as part of a research protocol
approved by an institutional review board of equivalent entity.
   (d)   Dover adopts the permissible provisions of ORC Section 3796.29 and
prohibits cultivators, processors, and retail dispensaries licensed under ORC
Chapter 3796 within the City of Dover.
   ORC Section 3796.04(G)(4) allows municipalities to prohibit marijuana use in
public places. Dover specifically prohibits marijuana use in public places.

been given notice of any actions brought against any City employee or officer,

her authority as such. Notice shall be provided the Law Director within ten
days after receipt of any action by such elected official, municipal employee,

persons qualifying for the privileges granted herein, the Law Director will not
be required to represent or otherwise participate on behalf of either party.

(Ord. 23-02. Passed 5-6-02.)
   169.06 REFUSAL TO CONSIDER.
   The Administration and the Liability Claims Review Board shall have the
discretion to refuse to consider any claim, if it is determined in its
discretion, that such claim should be processed and adjusted by the City’s
liability insurance carrier. Failure of the Administration or the Liability
Claims Review Board to act upon a claim made against the City of Dover shall
not be deemed an admission of liability; nor shall said failure to act be used
as evidence in any claim or suit brought against the City and/or its employees,
agents, or representatives.
(Ord. 23-02. Passed 5-6-02.)
   169.07 PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.

   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed in such a manner so as to
conflict with the City of Dover’s Liability Insurance Policies; and in so far
as this chapter conflicts therewith, any such conflicting provision of this
chapter shall be stricken.
(Ord. 23-02. Passed 5-6-02.)

170.01   Background.
170.02   Purpose.
170.03   Scope.
170.04   Policy.
170.05   Additional identity theft prevention program.
170.06   Responding to red flags.

170.08   Program administration.
   170.01 BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the Municipality, its employees and customers from data loss and
identity theft is of significant concern to the Municipality and can be reduced
only through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor.
(Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
   170.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The Municipality adopts this sensitive information policy to help
protect employees, customers, contractors and the Municipality from damages
related to the loss or misuse of sensitive information.
   (b)   This policy will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the Municipality in compliance with state and federal law
regarding identity theft protection.
   (c)   This policy enables the Municipality to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the
Municipality from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the
Municipality:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
(Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
   170.03 SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the Municipality,
including all personnel affiliated with third parties.
(Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
   170.04 POLICY.
   (a)   Sensitive Information Policy.
      (1)   Definition of sensitive information. Sensitive information includes
the following items whether stored in electronic or printed format:
         A.   Credit card information including any of the following:
            1.   Credit card number (in part or whole);
            2.   Credit card expiration date;
            3.    Cardholder name;
            4.    Cardholder address.
         B.   Tax identification numbers, including:
            1.    Social Security number;
            2.    Business identification number;
            3.    Employer identification numbers.
         C.   Payroll information including, among other information:
            1.    Paychecks;
            2.    Pay stubs.
         D.   Cafeteria plan check requests and associated paperwork.

not limited to:
            1.    Doctor names and claims;
            2.    Insurance claims;
            3.    Prescriptions;
            4.    Any related personal medical information.
         F.   Other personal information belonging to any customer, employee or
contractor, examples of which include:
            1.    Date of birth;
            2.    Address;
            3.    Phone numbers;
            4.    Maiden name;
            5.    Names;
            6.    Customer number.
         G.   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment
in securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public Records Act and the
Municipality's open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the
sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he/she should contact their
supervisor.
      (2)   Hard copy distribution. Each employee performing work for the
Municipality and each contractor performing services for the Municipality and
handling information for the Municipality that is the subject of this policy
will comply with the following policies:
         A.   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use or the room will be locked.
         B.   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
         C.   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
         D.   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common
shared work areas will be erased, removed, or shredded when not in use.
         E.   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded,
they will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical shredding device. Shred bins are labeled "Confidential paper
shredding and recycling." Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in
accordance with the Village's records retention policy.
      (3)   Electronic distribution. Each employee and contractor performing
work for the Municipality that deals with the records that are the subject of
this policy will comply with the following policies:
         A.   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using
approved municipal e-mail. Sensitive information may be encrypted when sent in
an electronic format to entities outside the City.
         B.   Any sensitive information sent externally may be encrypted and
may be password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a
statement such as this should be included in the e-mail:
            "This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary
information and is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally
addressed. Any use by others is strictly prohibited."
         C.   The oversight committee will review the possibility of encryption
and e-mail security.
(Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
   170.05 ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   (a)   Covered Accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. This program covers
every new and existing customer account that meets the following criteria:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there are a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the Municipality from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
 
   (b)   Red Flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.
         A.   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         B.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         C.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         D.   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in §334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act.
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         A.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         B.   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         C.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         D.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
 
   (c)   Suspicious Documents.
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the Municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
 
   (d)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information.
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the Municipality. For
example:
         A.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
         B.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or
         C.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
Municipality. For example, the address on an application is the same as the
address provided on a fraudulent application
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the Municipality. For example:
         A.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
         B.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
      (4)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
      (5)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar
to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of
other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the Municipality.
      (8)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
 
   (e)   Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered
Account.
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the Municipality receives a request for new, additional, or
replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the
account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
         A.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
         B.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
      (6)   The Municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements.
      (7)   The Municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or
transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.
      (8)   The Municipality receives notice from customers, victims of
identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding
possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the
Municipality.
      (9)   The Municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
   170.06 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
Municipality from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the employee's/contractor's supervisor for determination.
      (2)   The supervisor will complete additional authentication to determine
whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
 
   (b)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the Municipality; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer, that fraud has been attempted.
         (Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
   170.07 PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (a)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be re-evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program
are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
 
   (b)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
 
   (c)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
 
   (d)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the Municipality and its
customers.
(Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
   170.08 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Involvement of Management.
      (1)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the Mayor
and Auditor in their respective departments, the Utility Billing Department
Manager and to the oversight committee.
      (3)   Oversight of the Dover Identity Theft policy is delegated to the
Oversight Committee and the Dover Utility Office Manager. The committee shall
be appointed by the Mayor and shall include the Utility Billing Office Manager,
the Auditor, the Treasurer, the Director of Telecommunications and such other
persons as the Mayor determines are necessary to the effective use and
implementation of the policy.
 
   (b)   Staff Training.
      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may encounter
accounts or personally identifiable information that may constitute a risk to
the Municipality or its customers.
      (2)   The Mayor and Auditor are responsible for ensuring identity theft
training for all requisite employees and contractors.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
 
   (c)   Oversight of Service Provider Arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the Municipality to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.
         (Ord. 27-09. Passed 5-18-09.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
            Chap.
171.    Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex ref. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such

Code;
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
         D.   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
subsections (b)(1)A., B. and C. hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as
are applicable to the particular taxpayer and dividing the total so obtained by

result cannot be obtained under the formula provided for herein, the Tax
Administrator, upon application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to
substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect a fair and proper
apportionment.
 
   (c)   As used in subsection (b) hereof, “sales made in a municipal

      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within such
municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within such
municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place within
such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal corporation

rentals (to the extent above specified) on all properties located in Dover, and
on all properties located outside Dover, the net amount of which is not subject
to City income tax in said other community. In the case of residents of Dover,
if the net income of properties located outside Dover is subject to City income
tax in another community, then said net income will not be subject to City
income tax in Dover. Non-residents of Dover shall be subject to taxation upon
net income from rentals on all properties located in Dover.
 
   (e)   Net Operating Loss (NOL). The Municipality does not allow a net
operating loss carryback or carryforward.
 
   (f)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   A consolidated return may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for Federal income tax purposes pursuant
to section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. A consolidated return must
include all companies that are so affiliated.
(Ord. 36-05. Passed 9-19-05.)
      (2)   Each member of an affiliated group of corporations that files a
consolidated income tax return with the Municipality shall separately determine
its net profits in accordance with subsection (b) hereof. Each member of such
affiliated group of corporations shall separately determine its business
apportionment percentage in accordance with subsection (c) hereof. Each member
of such affiliated group of corporations shall separately apportion its own net
profits to the Municipality based on its own business apportionment percentage.
The separately computed and apportioned net profits of each member of such
affiliated group of corporations shall then be combined to determine the
consolidated income tax liability of such affiliated group of corporations. If
the foregoing method of computing and/or apportioning the net profits of an
affiliated group of corporations subject to the Municipality's income tax does
not produce an equitable result, the City Auditor may substitute another method
of computation and/or apportionment to produce an equitable result, and an
affiliated group of corporations subject to the Municipality's income tax may,
if the approval of the City Auditor is obtained, substitute another method of
computation and/or apportionment to produce an equitable result.

whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on or before April

other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of
such fiscal year or period. The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to
provide by regulation that the return of an employer or employers, showing the
amount of Municipal tax deducted by said employer or employers from the
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of an employee, and paid by
him or them to the Tax Administrator may be accepted as the return required of
any employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this Tax Code, is such
qualifying wage, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income.
 
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
city return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income
and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
 
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator; or on
a generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the Municipality’s prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
 
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)      The amount of the tax imposed by this Tax Code on such earnings

Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
 
   (e)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
Municipal Income Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
Municipal Income Tax Return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal tax return does
not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by Section
181.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Tax Administrator shall be granted upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
 
   (f)   Payments with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due.
However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
181.14 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
181.14 of this Tax Code, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code may
have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at
his election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
 
   (g)      Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
181.03. The Tax Administrator shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
(Ord. 36-05. Passed 9-19-05.)
      (3)   An amended return that lowers the amount of tax liability owed to
the City of Dover or that requests a refund of tax claimed to be overpaid must
be filed within three years of the date that the original return was required
to be filed without extensions.
(Ord. 5-07. Passed 3-5-07.)
 
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after
notification by the Tax Administrator, or his authorized representative, to
file the items required by this paragraph.
(Ord. 36-05. Passed 9-19-05.)
 
   181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside,
the tax at the rate provided in Section
181.03 hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations
prescribed by the Tax Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the
payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such
taxes have in fact been withheld.
 
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
 
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
 
   (d)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than $1,000 per month, payments may be
made quarterly on or before the last day of the month following the end of each
quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments whenever
the Tax Administrator has reason to believe that the conditions for granting

   To provide funds for municipal purposes, there shall be and is hereby levied
a tax at one and one-half percent (1 and 1/2%) on qualifying wages, commissions
and other compensation, and on other net profits and taxable income as
specifically authorized and as stated in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code
and specifically Ohio R.C. 718.01, 718.011, and 718.012 as hereinafter
provided. The primary location where an employee is domiciled for tax purposes
is Dover where the individual for all or part of a taxable year was domiciled
in the municipal corporation on the last day of the immediately preceding
taxable year or if the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the
individual is domiciled in the municipal corporation for all or part of the
taxable year. The determination of the Tax Administrator on the question of the
domicile of an individual or employee, if not contrary to a specific dictate of
ORC Section 718.012, is presumptively valid and enforceable, and cannot be
overturned, except pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard of Ohio law.
The employee shall be considered domiciled in Dover for tax imposition purposes
where the employee works out of a yard or facility that the employer maintains
in Dover. Such yard or facility is the primary location where the individual is
employed.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)

measured by municipal taxable income. The Municipality shall tax income at a
uniform rate. The tax is levied on Municipal Taxable Income, as defined herein.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)

   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 45-15, effective

   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.

masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a

under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other

Revenue Code;

an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)   Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the extent

the computation of federal taxable income;

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable

   The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that
is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.

the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.
      (I)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

Section

a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the

the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the

qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
183.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to

   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   “Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
183.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
183.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
183.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
183.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
183.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
183.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal

resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
183.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
183.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
183.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
183.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality

on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

183.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

   Taxes shall be paid as provide by Chapter 718 of the ORC, and specifically
as defined and as provided in section ORC section 718.01. Except as otherwise
provided in ORC chapter 718, and specifically under ORC section 718.01 and
718.04(D), a credit shall be allowed of the tax paid to another municipality in
the state of Ohio, up to the rate charged by the City of Dover, presently under
Dover Codified Ordinance Chapter
181, and on the effective date of this chapter, at 1 ½%. The determination of
domicile shall be as stated in Dover Codified Ordinances Section
183.042 and ORC section 718.212. If there is determined to be a conflict
between ORC chapter 718, sections 718.01, 718.212, or 718.042 and this chapter,
ORC chapter 718, section 718.01, 718.212, and 718.042 shall prevail. If it is
required that Dover allow a tax credit, it shall only be for the amount
required by law up to 1 ½%. (Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
183.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
183.096 of this
Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
183.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
183.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
   
   183.091   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident and
resident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
183.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident or resident individual
taxpayer's sole income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net

end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
183.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
183.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
183.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
183.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
183.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
183.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
183.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of section
183.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual

the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
183.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten

   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including

documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)

taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
183.10 of this Chapter.

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,

to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine

through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 45-15. Passed
12-7-15.)
   183.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail

include the person's social security number, federal employer identification

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
183.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
183.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
183.15 of this Chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue

corporations.

section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective

after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who

(Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Ohio Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   183.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
183.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section 183.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any
court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed,
so that the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment
is less than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
183.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall also
report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed in
the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall

183 is deemed amended to conform to the requirements of Ohio R.C. 718.27, and
718.80 to 718.95 for tax years commencing after December 31, 2017. If specific

Revised Code statutory requirements, or as recommended to demonstrate needed
compliance with the required amended sections and if the state statutory
sections 718.27, and 718.80 to 718.95 are found to be constitutional, and
binding on municipalities, Council will provide specific changes needed to
conform Dover ordinances to those sections and those amendments. Those
amendments will be deemed to be effective on the date established by the courts
of the State of Ohio.
 
   (b)   Council hereby expressly finds and determines that it does not concede
the legality of H.B. 49's municipal income tax provisions; Section 803.100 of
H.B. 49; Section 718.04(A) of the Ohio Revised Code; or any other law that is
the subject of the action pending in Case Number 2017 CV 10258 in the Franklin
Council of Common Pleas, and that the City of Dover reserves its rights to
continue is participation in and prosecution of said litigation, and any other
litigation challenging the State’s authority to dictate municipal tax
collection and administration, and that adoption of this section shall not
prejudice the claims of the City.
(Ord. 10-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
   183.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter. (Ord. 45-15. Passed 12-7-
15.)

Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within

presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the

         A.    The time, place, size or conduct of the block party would
unreasonably interfere with the public convenience and safe use of the streets
and highways.
         B.    The block party would require the diversion of so great a number
of police officers to properly police the area of such party so as to deny
normal police protection to the Municipality.
         C.    The block party would unreasonably interfere with the movement
of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or ambulance service to other areas
of the Municipality.
         D.    The block party would unreasonably interfere with a parade,
procession or assemblage for which a permit has been issued.
         E.    The information contained in the application is found to be
false, misleading or incomplete in any material detail.
         F.    An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper
conduct of the block party.
      (4)    The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe
reasonable conditions, including the hours, the location, and the streets,
highways or portions thereof which may be used or occupied. The Mayor is hereby
authorized to adopt policies and procedures applicable to the issuance of any
such permit. Upon the adoption thereof, such policies and procedures shall be
maintained in the office of the Mayor, and available for public inspection.
   (b)    Any persons conducting or participating in a block party pursuant to
a permit issued in accordance with the within section, shall abide by the
provisions of Part Five (General Offenses
Code) of the Dover Codified Ordinances, and the issuance of any such permit
shall not be a defense to a charge of having violated said provisions.
   (c)    For purposes of the within section, the term, "block party" shall be
defined as a neighborhood social gathering of two or more individuals during
which the said individuals seek to block off and/or occupy a portion of the
public right of way for purposes of conducting such
gathering.
   (d)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   (e)    During periods of public health emergencies (including pandemics)
declared by the governor or the State of Ohio, or the Ohio Department of
Health, a local public health emergency declared by the Tuscarawas County
Department of Health under authorities granted under the Ohio Constitution and
statutes enacted in conformance thereto, and orders issued pursuant to those
constitutional and statutory authorities, those orders are deemed incorporated
into any permit issued pursuant to this ordinance. Recommendations issued by
these authorities will also be deemed part of the guidance issued under this
section but are not directly within the ambit of the permit so issued unless
specifically referenced in an attachment to the permit. As noted in subsections
above, and when deemed necessary for the health and safety of the citizens of
Dover, health and safety limitations may be incorporated into permits under
issued under this section of the Dover Codified Ordinances.

   313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
   313.031 RIGHT TURNS ON RED PROHIBITED.

   313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the

(ORC 4511.19)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
a combination of them or while the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in
subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
(ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

4510.02.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

plea of guilty, waiver of court appearance and acknowledgement of conviction of
the alleged offense and may be accepted in full satisfaction of the prescribed
penalty for such alleged violation. Payment of the prescribed fine need not be

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly
indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined
in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of
culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.15 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

imposed by law with respect to the public servant’s office, or recklessly do
any act expressly forbidden by law with respect to the public servant’s office.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of dereliction of duty, a
misdemeanor of the second degree.
   (g)   As used in this section, “public servant” includes an officer or

   501.23 INTERFERING WITH CIVIL RIGHTS.
   (a)    No public servant, under color of the public servant’s office,
employment, or authority, shall knowingly deprive, or conspire or attempt to
deprive any person of a constitutional or statutory right.

rights, a misdemeanor of the first degree. (ORC 2921.45)
   501.24 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.

abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was

misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.

offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.

voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:

conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;

pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
    (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:

First degree                                  $5,000.00

anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the

serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
537.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
537.05,
537.06, or
537.08,
537.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
537.15 or
537.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
537.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
537.05 or
537.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
537.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
537.05,
537.06 or
537.08, Section
537.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
537.15 or
537.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
537.05 or
537.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   545.011 OHIO R.C. 9.68 COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   The individual right to keep and bear arms, being a fundamental
individual right that predates the United States Constitution and Ohio
Constitution, and being a constitutionally protected right in every part of
Ohio, the general assembly finds the need to provide uniform laws throughout
the state regulating the ownership, possession, purchase, other acquisition,
transport, storage, carrying, sale, other transfer, manufacture, taxation,
keeping, and reporting of loss or theft of firearms, their components, and
their ammunition. The general assembly also finds and declares that it is
proper for law-abiding people to protect themselves, their families, and others
from intruders and attackers without fear of prosecution or civil action for
acting in defense of themselves or others. Except as specifically provided by
the United States Constitution, Ohio Constitution, state law, or federal law, a
person, without further license, permission, restriction, delay, or process,
including by any ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice, or other
action or any threat of citation, prosecution, or other legal process, may own,
possess, purchase, acquire, transport, store, carry, sell, transfer,
manufacture, or keep any firearm, part of a firearm, its components, and its
ammunition. Any such further license, permission, restriction, delay, or
process interferes with the fundamental individual right described in this
division and unduly inhibits law-abiding people from protecting themselves,
their families, and others from intruders and attackers and from other
legitimate uses of constitutionally protected firearms, including hunting and
sporting activities, and the state by this section preempts, supersedes, and
declares null and void any such further license, permission, restriction,
delay, or process.
   (b)   A person, group, or entity adversely affected by any manner of
ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice, or other action enacted or
enforced by a political subdivision in conflict with division (a) of this
section may bring a civil action against the political subdivision seeking
damages from the political subdivision, declaratory relief, injunctive relief,
or a combination of those remedies. Any damages awarded shall be awarded
against, and paid by, the political subdivision. In addition to any actual
damages awarded against the political subdivision and other relief provided
with respect to such an action, the court shall award reasonable expenses to
any person, group, or entity that brings the action, to be paid by the
political subdivision, if either of the following applies:
      (1)    The person, group, or entity prevails in a challenge to the
ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice, or action as being in
conflict with division (a) of this section.
      (2)    The ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice, or action
or the manner of its enforcement is repealed or rescinded after the civil
action was filed but prior to a final court determination of the action.
   (c)    As used in this section:
      (1)    The possession, transporting, or carrying of firearms, their
components, or their ammunition include, but are not limited to, the
possession, transporting, or carrying, openly or concealed on a person's person
or concealed ready at hand, of firearms, their components, or their ammunition.
      (2)    "Firearm" has the same meaning as in section 2923.11 of the
Revised Code.
      (3)    "Reasonable expenses" include, but are not limited to, reasonable
attorney's fees, court costs, expert witness fees, and compensation for loss of
income.
   (d)    This section does not apply to either of the following:
      (1)    A zoning ordinance that regulates or prohibits the commercial sale
of firearms, firearm components, or ammunition for firearms in areas zoned for
residential or agricultural uses;
      (2)    A zoning ordinance that specifies the hours of operation or the
geographic areas where the commercial sale of firearms, firearm components, or
ammunition for firearms may occur, provided that the zoning ordinance is
consistent with zoning ordinances for other retail establishments in the same
geographic area and does not result in a de facto prohibition of the commercial
sale of firearms, firearm components, or ammunition for firearms in areas zoned
for commercial, retail, or industrial uses.
   (e)   All ordinances of the city in conflict with this section shall be
amended to comport with Section
545.011. All ordinances in conflict with this section effective December 28,
2019 shall not be enforced except in compliance with Section
545.011. To avoid conflict with Section
545.011 and Ohio R.C. Section 9.68, it is directed and recommended that police
officers, City officers, City boards, and commissions comply with this section
(where there is a conflict with this section and Ohio R.C. 9.68), and any
application, amendment, ruling, action, citation, or other action taken by a
board, commission, police officer, and City officer shall comply with this
section. All ordinances in opposition to Section
545.011 are amended to comply with Ohio R.C. 9.68. The use, possession,
discharge, etc., shall be in compliance with this section. Until full
clarification of this section and Ohio R.C. Section 9.68 is rendered by the
courts, police officers shall cite under the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) as amended
for firearms, arms, weapons, guns, and any components thereof, that are in
compliance with Ohio R.C. 9.68. Zoning ordinances of Dover shall also be
enforced only in compliance with this section and Ohio R.C. Section 9.68.

carrying or possession of a handgun, is an active duty member of the armed
forces of the United States and is carrying a valid military identification

justify a prudent person in going armed.
      (2)   The weapon was carried or kept ready at hand by the actor for

satisfactory to the Mayor after a recommendation from the Shade Tree
Commission, that the applicant is qualified and has the experience and training
to engage in tree trimming, tree removal and tree surgery work for hire; that
the applicant agrees to comply with the specifications for tree trimming, tree
removal and tree surgery work for hire; and provided that before any license
shall be issued, each applicant shall first file evidence of possession of
liability insurance in the minimum amounts of three hundred thousand dollars
($300,000) for bodily injury or death and one hundred thousand dollars

underground water line, sewer line, transmission line or other utility.
   (g)    It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm or
City department to top any tree, park tree or other tree on public property.
Topping is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than

electric, water and sewer utilities unless and until any other entity desiring
to provide such service obtains a franchise or like permit from the City of
Dover setting forth the terms and conditions under which it may operate or
serve consumers within the City of Dover. Service from facilities existing as

the option of such residents having such arrangements and connections, unless
the City of Dover obtains such authorization or approval as may be required
under the laws of the State of Ohio to cause such existing arrangements and
connections to be terminated and utility service provided by the City of Dover
or other franchised providers to be substituted for service provided under such
other arrangements and connections.
(Ord. 45-98. Passed 7-6-98.)
   920.05 SCOPE.

authority of the City of Dover under the laws and Constitution of Ohio,
including the right to sell utility products and services outside its corporate
limits. (Ord. 45-98. Passed 7-6-98.)
   920.06 IMPLEMENTATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   The Law Director is hereby authorized and directed to initiate, in
consultation with the Mayor, such applications and other proceedings before the
courts and administrative agencies of the State of Ohio as may be necessary and
appropriate to obtain any and all orders or other relief required to effectuate
the purposes of this chapter.

due amount shown on the bill will be accepted for one full day following the
net due date at the City Utilities Office, Third Street, Dover, for payments
that are mailed by the net due date, payments made at local banks which are
stamped “PAID” by the due date, and in person at the counter.
   (b)   At the same time that penalties are applied, overdue notices are sent
allowing seven business days for payment of the current due amount plus
penalties. This notice includes, but is not limited to, a date after which
service may be terminated if payment is not made, the customer’s name, account
number and the amount that must be paid to avert termination of service (no
less than the current amount plus penalties).
   (c)   Terminations of service for nonpayment of utility bills shall be
carried out on the Monday or Tuesday morning following elapse of the time
allowed to pay at least the current amount plus penalties.
   (d)    On the day that water or electric service is to be discontinued for
nonpayment, water division and/or electric field division personnel will
terminate utility service to the residence/account and leave written notice in
the form of a brightly-colored card or door hanger that water or electric
service has been discontinued for nonpayment. This card/door hanger shall
include the telephone number of the City Utility Billing Office, and the hours
during which the Utility Billing Office is open for business. The card/door
hanger shall be left in a conspicuous location.

organizations or firms retained to manage a customer's affairs will avert
immediate disconnection.

recovered or having the possibility of not being recovered shall be equally
divided between the City and those land owners who would benefit from the
construction of the sanitary sewer main.
   (b)    The above shall be modified for the following situation: Whenever the
requested sanitary sewer construction serves lots or lands only on one side of
the street, the applicable front footage fee for that situation shall be thirty
dollars ($30.00) per front footage.
   (c)    The fifteen dollar ($15.00) and thirty dollar ($30.00) front footage
costs are estimates of all the costs to install a sanitary sewer main including
manholes, fittings, pavement or right of way repair, engineering, inspection,
legal fees or any other costs directly related to the installation. These costs
shall be used for making the original determination of individual and City
construction costs. After the sanitary sewer main has been installed, a final
cost determination shall be made based upon the actual installation costs.
Individual construction charges and the portion to be paid by the City will
then be adjusted either upward or downward according to the final costs.
   (d)    Upon request of the landowner pursuant to this section, the Director
of Public Service shall determine the estimated cost pursuant to this section,
and shall in writing notify the landowner of the landowner's estimated portion
of the construction cost. Within fifteen days after such notification the
landowner shall deposit with the City a sum equal to the estimated cost. Such
sum shall be deposited in the appropriate construction fund and the landowner
shall be credited with the receipt thereof. Upon completion, the landowner's
portion of the cost shall be paid from the fund. If the actual cost of
construction is less than the estimated cost the Service Director shall cause
the balance of the deposit to be returned to the landowner. If the actual cost
is greater than the estimated cost then the landowner shall remit the entire
balance due before he shall be permitted to connect to the system.

shall be used for making the original determination of individual and City
construction costs. After the water main has been installed, a final cost
determination shall be made based upon the actual installation costs.

sum shall be deposited in the appropriate construction fund and the landowner
shall be credited with the receipt thereof. Upon completion, the landowner’s
portion of the cost shall be paid from the fund. If the actual cost of
construction is less than the estimated cost the Service Director shall cause

satisfactory to him in order to measure the sewage. The Director shall charge
the same rate as that charged for City water service.
   (c)    In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Director of
Public Service, with respect to any premises, that a portion of the water from
any source consumed on the premises does not and cannot enter the system, then
in each such case, the owner or interested party may, at his expense, install
and maintain separate metering devices to the extent necessary to demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Service the portion of the water
consumed on the premises which is discharged into the system, which portion
shall constitute the basis for computing the sewer charge for the premises
under Sections
927.15 to
927.17. (Ord. 3-86. Passed 3-17-86.)
   927.19 CHARGES PAYABLE MONTHLY; PENALTY CHARGE.

   (b)    In respect to premises not served by the City water works system, the
charges shall be billed and payable monthly, unless otherwise determined by the
Director of Public Service. Any premises making connection with the system
shall be charged a per diem rate amount, based upon the monthly minimum charge,
from the time the connection is made or the discharge into the system is begun
until the commencement of the next following billing period applicable to the
premises, except that should the measured service exceed the minimum charge the
measured rate shall be charged. In case of failure to pay any bill for sewer
charges when due, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of such charges shall be added
to the bill. (Ord. 2-90. Passed 2-5-90.)
   927.20 CHARGES MADE A LIEN.
   (a)    Each sewer charge levied pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a
lien upon the premises charged therewith, and if the same is not paid within
thirty days after it is due and payable, it shall be certified to the County
Auditor, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate, with the interest and
penalties allowed by law, and be collected as other Municipal taxes are
collected.
   (b)    The City shall also have the right, in the event of nonpayment, to
discontinue service to the premises of water supplied by the City water works
system until the unpaid sewer charges have been fully paid. (Ord. 3-86. Passed

   927.30 LIMITED ACCESS TO DISCHARGE RESIDENTIAL TREATED WASTEWATER INTO THE
STORM SEWER WATERS.
   (a)   Dover City Council modifies its wastewater regulations and ordinances
to allow in only very limited circumstances wastewater into the storm water
collection system of the City of Dover, if and only if the landowner has been
permitted by the Tuscarawas County Health Department to discharge final
tertiary treated and disinfected wastewater under EPA NPDES standards. This
section will create a limited residential discharge exception only under these
specified circumstances and if the discharge does not invalidate or cause a
violation of a City of Dover EPA NPDES permit for wastewater or storm water.
This exception to the ordinances of the City of Dover shall be allowed only
under these strict conditions:
      (1)   The effluent from the treatment system must meet the Ohio EPA NPDES
Permit standards for tertiary treatment and disinfection at all times.
      (2)   The treatment system shall have a basin or tank from which a sample
of the final treatment can be obtained.
      (3)   Employees of the Dover Wastewater Department shall have access to
the system at all times for maintenance inspection of the equipment and
effluent sampling. A failure to allow access upon any request shall cause
notice to be issued that the discharge shall be terminated thirty days from the
denial of access and immediately if it determined that the discharge is causing
an immediate threat to public health or safety.
      (4)   Upon notification by the City of Dover that the treatment system is
not functioning properly or discharging an unsuitable effluent that does not
meet said tertiary or disinfection standards, the owner must repair or replace
the treatment system within a period of ten days. Failure of the owner to not
restore the system shall deny the owner access to the City's storm sewer
system.
      (5)   A shut-off valve shall be installed in the treatment system's
discharge line prior to entering the storm sewer for the purpose of stopping
unacceptable discharge flows from the treatment system.
      (6)   In addition to any damages or costs of cleanup, the owner of the
treatment system and landowner shall be liable for any damage or cleanup to the
Dover storm water system, Dry Hollow Creek, and drainage or storm waters, storm
water sewers, or downstream waters caused by the failure of the treatment
system or discharges into these waters or systems.
      (7)   In addition to the costs referenced in subsection (a)(6) hereof,
the owner of the treatment system and landowner shall be subject to a civil
fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for the first thirty days and two
hundred dollars ($200.00) a day for the next thirty days, and three hundred
dollars ($300.00) a day thereafter for not complying with the requirements of
this ordinance, its health department permit, the EPA NPDES permit issued to
the landowner/owner or the City of Dover.
      (8)   At any such future time that the Ohio EPA determines that the City
of Dover has a combined storm sewer and sanitary wastewater system, and must
obtain a permit for it, the owner shall remove the discharge line from Dover's
storm water system.
      (9)   Also, at any future time when Dover constructs a sanitary sewer
line on Park View Drive, the owner shall cease discharge in the storm water
system and connect to the sanitary sewer line. If any other permits are allowed
by the Tuscarawas County Department of Health for a tertiary and fully
disinfected discharge into Dover's storm sewers, the same requirements will
also apply. The landowner/owner shall be required to connect to the City of
Dover's wastewater system if a wastewater sewer connection by extension becomes
available or if the connection violates an EPA NPDES permit for wastewater or
storm water issued to the City of Dover.
      (10)   For the privilege of using the City storm sewer system for
discharging treated sanitary sewer flows, the Owner shall be invoiced for this
service based upon its City water usage, and at the rate that all Dover
residents pay for sanitary sewer services.
      (11)   The manufacturer's user information for the system shall be
retained on file with the City of Dover service department and wastewater
system and the operation of the system as permitted by the Tuscarawas County
Health Department is incorporated into and becomes part of the limited
privilege to connect to Dover's system(s) to identify the limitations of the
system for Walker and future owners.
         (Ord. 11-21. Passed 3-1-21.)
   927.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    Civil Penalty. Any user who is found to have violated an order of
Council or who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter and the
orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, may be fined. At least
a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine is mandatory under this section. Each day
during which the violation occurs shall constitute a separate offense.
   (b)    Costs of Damage. Any user violating any of the provisions of this
chapter, or who has a discharge which causes a deposit, obstruction, damage or
other impairment to the City's wastewater disposal system shall become liable
for any expense, loss or damage caused by the violation or discharge. The
Director of Public Service may add to the user's charges and fees, the costs
assessed for any cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation
or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
   (c)   Falsifying Information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representation, or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to
this chapter or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

   928.18 SURCHARGES.
   All persons discharging sewage or industrial wastes exceeding strengths of
normal sewage but acceptable for discharge into the WWTP shall be subject to a
monthly surcharge determined on the basis of the following parameters:
    (a)    "Normal sewage" means sewage with a daily average of not more than
300 parts per million of suspended solids, and not more than 250 parts per
million of BOD, and not more than 20 parts per million of phosphate, and not
more than 15 parts per million of ammonia.
    (b)    The surcharge per person shall be determined as follows: The
excessive pounds of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids,
phosphates, ammonia, and oil and grease will be computed by multiplying the
person's sewage flow volume in million gallons per day by the constant 8.345
and then multiplying this product by the difference between the person's
concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids,
phosphates, ammonia, and oil and grease and the normal concentrations provided
in Chapter
927 in parts per million by weight. The surcharge for each constituent will
then be determined by multiplying the excess pounds of each constituent by the
appropriate rate of surcharge provided in Chapter
927. This product will then be multiplied by the number of days in the billing
period to determine the surcharge.
   (c)    Any surcharge assessed for excess pollutants shall be in addition to
normal charges and shall not relieve the discharger of liability for
inhibition, pass through or damage caused by such discharge.
      (Ord. 34-95. Passed 6-19-95.)
   928.19 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the City finds that any discharger has violated any provision of
this chapter, its industrial discharge permit, or an order of the City or court
of competent jurisdiction the Service Director shall serve written notice
stating the nature of the alleged violation. No later than ten (10) days after
the receipt date of this notice, the discharger shall respond in writing with
an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of the
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation.
(Ord. 34-95. Passed 6-19-95.)
   928.20 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   Where any violation of this chapter is not corrected by timely compliance,
the Service Director may order any discharger, to show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the
discharger by personal service, or certified mail, return receipt requested,
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City or its
designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to
be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the discharger to show
cause before the City or its designee why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten
(10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or
authorized representative of a discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall
be considered by the City which shall then enter appropriate orders with
respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger. The orders may be
in the form of a compliance order or cease and desist order.
(Ord. 34-95. Passed 6-19-95.)
   928.21 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Service Director finds that an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate this chapter, its industrial discharge permit, or an order
of the City or court of competent jurisdiction, he may issue an order to the
industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been
installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other
requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology,
additional self-monitoring, and management practices.

and the industrial discharge permit of a discharger when it appears to the City
that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens an imminent or
substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to
the environment, or interferes with the operation of the WWTP. Any discharger
notified of the suspension of the City's wastewater treatment service or the
discharger's industrial discharge permit, shall immediately cease all
discharge. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary,

TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
    (c)    Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum
or longer term average) that the Service Director determines has caused, alone

   Any discharger violating any provision of this chapter, their industrial
discharge permit, or any order of the City or court of competent jurisdiction
which results in damage or impairment of the City's wastewater treatment system
or which results in excessive costs of treatment shall be liable to the City
for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violating discharge. The City
shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred as a result of the discharge.

violation occurs, shall be considered a separate violation.
    (b)    In determining the amount of an administrative fine, the City shall

violations or compliance, economic advantage accrued by the violator due to the
violation, and actions taken by the violator to comply with this chapter.
    (c)    Any administrative fines assessed by the City may be added to the
person's sewer service charge, and the City shall have such collection remedies
as provided to collect other service charges.

   961.01 SERVICE FEE, COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS, AND COLLECTION OF INSURANCE.
   (a)   (1)   Basic Life Support (BLS). The Director of Public Safety is
hereby authorized to charge a fee for residents of the City of Dover of six
hundred dollars ($600.00) to each recipient of basic life support (BLS)
services. Basic life support (BLS) is transportation by ground ambulance
vehicle and the provision of medically necessary supplies and services,
including basic life support services as defined by the State of Ohio. The
ambulance must have an individual who is qualified in the State of Ohio as an
emergency medical technician-basic (EMT-Basic).
      (2)   Advanced Life Support, Level 1 (ALS1). The Director of Public
Safety is hereby authorized to charge a fee for residents of the City of Dover
of eight hundred dollars ($800.00) to each recipient of Advanced Life Support,
Level 1 Services (ALS1). Advanced Life Support-1 Services (ALS1) is the
transportation by ground ambulance vehicle and the provision of medically
necessary supplies and services including the provision of ALS assessment and
at least one ALS intervention. Advanced Life Support (ALS) assessment is an
assessment performed by an ALS crew as part of an emergency response. An
Advanced Life Support intervention is a procedure that is, in accordance with
the law of the State of Ohio, beyond the scope of practice of an emergency
medical technician-basic (EMT-Basic). Emergency response is a BLS or ALS1 level
of service that has been provided in response to a 911 call or the equivalent.
ALS personnel are individuals trained to the level of emergency medical
technician-intermediate (EMT-Intermediate) or paramedic. An EMT-Intermediate is
an individual who is qualified, in accordance with the law of the State of Ohio
to perform essential advanced techniques and to administer a limited number of
medications. A paramedic possesses the qualifications of an EMT-Intermediate
and, in accordance with the law of the State of Ohio, has enhanced skills that
include being able to administer additional interventions and medications.
      (3)   Advanced Life Support, Level 2. The Director of Public Safety is
hereby authorized to charge a fee for residents of the City of Dover of nine
hundred dollars ($900.00) to each recipient of Advanced Life Support, Level 2
Services (ALS2. (ALS2) is the transportation by ground ambulance vehicle and
the provision of medically necessary supplies and services including (1) at
least three separate administrations of one or more medications by intravenous
push/bolus or by continuous infusion (excluding crystalloid fluids) or (2)
ground ambulance transport and the provision of one of the recognized ALS2
procedures as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or the State of Ohio, as
periodically amended (presently defined and applications and procedures
contained in Program Memorandum Intermediaries/Carriers, Transmittal AB-02-
130).
         For purposes of ALS2 definitions, the ALS2 procedures are (and as
amended in the future regulations) are:
         A.   Manual Defibrillation/cardioversion;
         B.   Endotracheal intubation;
         C.   Central venous line;
         D.   Cardiac pacing;
         E.   Cheat decomprehension;
         F.   Surgical airway; and
         G.   Intraosseous line.
         Endotracheal intubation is one of the services that qualify for the
ALS2 level of payment; therefore, it is not necessary to consider medications
administered by endotracheal intubation for the purpose of determining whether
the ALS2 rate is payable. The monitoring and maintenance of an endotracheal
tube that was previously inserted prior to the transport also qualifies as an
ALS2 procedure.
      (4)   Annual Rate Adjustments. Medicare increases ambulance or EMS
allowable charges on a yearly basis based upon a cost of living adjustment
provided by Federal law. The rates charged by the city of Dover for all
services authorized in subsections (a)(1),(2), and (3) and subsections (c) and
(d) shall be adjusted at the same percentage increase as computed by Medicare.
The rate adjustment shall be effective on January 1 of each year commencing
with January 1, 2023 and each year thereafter and shall be increased by the
same amount as authorized in the prior year Medicare increases. Rates shall not
decrease without further action of council in the event that Medicare reduced
any rates.
   (b)   Dover Township Citizen Rates. The quarterly payments made by Dover
Township in fulfillment of the annual fee assessed by the City of Dover to
provided Fire, Rescue and Emergency Medical Service (Ambulance) as spelled out
in the contract existing between the City of Dover and Dover Township to
provide said Fire, Rescue and Emergency Medical Service (Ambulance) to the
residents of Dover Township, shall constitute payment of basic and advanced
life support services for Dover Township residents who are transported, except
for the permissible collection of Medicare and insurance available for payment
of services. So long as Dover Township remains current on its obligations as
established by the existing Fire, Rescue and Emergency Medical Service
(Ambulance) Agreement, except for Medicare and insurance payments available and
collectible for these services, no additional payment for such services shall
be required ofresidents of Dover Township.
   (c)   Mileage Fee. The Director of Public Safety is hereby authorized to
charge a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) per loaded mile for each mile of
ambulance transportation rendered to a recipient of life support services, from
the point of first contact with said recipient. Said charges shall apply to all
individuals, receiving such services, except for residents of Dover Township,
who shall be exempt from such payment for the reasons specified in subsection
above, unless Medicare or insurance can be billed or collected for this
service.
   (d)   Billing of Dover City Residents. Dover city and Dover Township
residents shall be subject to insurance and Medicare only billing.
   (e)   Contract for Collection Services. Dover, through its Safety Director
or Fire Chief, shall be authorized to enter into a contract for billing
services, and to enter into an agreement or otherwise arrange for the
collection of unpaid accounts of non-residents of Dover and Dover Township with
a local outside independent agency for insurance and Medicare only collection.
The contract shall allow a service charge that is competitive and equitable
with an outside agency in an amount that is within the range of marketable
services for this service and would be the best available contract for these
services. The collection agency shall make three attempts to collect the bill
from available Dover resident or Dover Township resident insurance or Medicare
benefits. In the event that those collection efforts are unsuccessful, the
Mayor, Safety Director, or Fire Chief shall contract with an outside agency to
collect the funds that can be collected pursuant to the authorizations in this
ordinance. After a commercially reasonable period, if the amounts remain
uncollected, and the agency determines that the amounts probably will not be
collected, active collection methods may be abandoned. If the person to whom
service was provided has real estate, the agency is authorized to take
reasonable steps to cause a lien to be placed on the real estate of the person
to whom service was provided by legally authorized methods. Otherwise,
collection efforts may be abandoned. If the agency notifies the City of the
uncollectable bill, then one year after the last attempt to collect, the amount
billed to the Dover city resident or Dover Township resident shall be written
off and removed from the books as an amount claimed to be owed by the City of
Dover for these services.
   The collection service shall provide accounting of revenues collected and
charges made on no less than a quarterly basis. The billing shall notify the
resident that the bill shall be forwarded to either Medicare or insurance and
that no personal liability will be imposed.
(Ord. 57-22. Passed 11-21-22.)
   961.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF AMBULANCE SERVICE.
   (a)   The emergency ambulance service within the City is hereby established
and placed under the direction of the Director of Public Safety.
   (b)   The Director of Public Safety shall be the executive head of the
emergency ambulance service and the chief administrative authority thereof. He
shall establish all rules and regulations for the operation of such service
subject to approval by Council.
   (c)   The Director of Public Safety shall annually report to Council
regarding the operation of the emergency ambulance service.

shall be known and may be cited as the “Subdivision Regulations for Dover,
Ohio”, and shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Subdivision Regulations”.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1103.02 INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Subdivision
Regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare. To protect the public,
among other purposes, such provisions are intended to provide for permanently
wholesome community environment, adequate public services and safer streets and
highways.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1103.03 SCOPE.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a
part of a subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Subdivision Regulations. Nor is it intended by these Subdivision Regulations to
repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with existing
provisions of other laws or regulations, except those specifically repealed by
these Subdivision Regulations, or with private restrictions placed upon
property by deed, covenant or other private agreement, or with restrictive
covenants running with the land to which the County is a party. Where these
Subdivision Regulations impose a greater restriction upon land than is imposed
or required by such existing provisions of law, resolution, contract or deed,
the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations shall control.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1103.04 APPLICABILITY TO VARIOUS USES.
   Subdividers or developers of shopping centers and other commercial as well
as industrial uses, must comply with the same requirements as residential
developers. Plans or written and signed statements regarding highway access
points and planted areas and buffer strips may be required where applicable.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1103.05 ADMINISTRATION AND AUTHORITY.
   The City Planning Commission, having adopted a major highway plan according
to statutory requirements, and Council by virtue of the provisions of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 711, are authorized, subject to the holding of the required public
hearings, to adopt rules and regulations covering plats for subdivisions of
land and to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove plats or subdivisions
of land falling within their jurisdiction. Administration of the rules and
regulations contained herein shall be the responsibility of the City Planning
Commission. (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1103.06 JURISDICTION.
   The provisions of these Subdivision Regulations shall apply to all plats,
subdivisions and conveyances of land in the City or within three miles of the
corporate limits thereof as described in Ohio R.C. 711.09. The City Planning
Commission shall have the power of final approval of the plats, except that the
provisions of Chapter
1111 within the three mile radius shall be the jurisdiction of the County
Engineer.
   (a)   No person shall divide or lay out into lots any land within the
Municipality or three mile area unless it is by a plat complying with the
Subdivision Regulations herein contained. No plat shall be recorded and no lot
or land shall be sold from any such plat until such plat has been approved as
herein required.

   (b)   The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform with the
requirements hereof. The subdivider shall make improvements and shall submit
preliminary and final plans, all in accordance with these Subdivision
Regulations.
   (c)   The division of a tract in to five parcels or less, fronting upon an
existing street, and where the transfer is to be accomplished by the recording
of a deed rather than a plat, requires the approval of the City Planning
Commission before it can be recorded. Such approval may be accomplished in the
manner provided in Section
1107.04.
However, if in the opinion of the City Planning Commission, the tract has
potential to be ultimately divided into more than five parcels by subsequent
further division of one or more of the parcels, the City Planning Commission
may require full compliance with the Subdivision Regulations herein contained.

   (d)   Within three miles of the corporate limits, the City of Dover shall
maintain jurisdiction over the patterns of streets under the authority of the
City Planning Commission. (Ord. 20-96. Passed 5-20-96.)

resident or neighboring property owner may, prior to acting on a preliminary
map of a subdivision, hold a hearing thereon at such time and upon such notice
as the Commission may designate.

   1103.08 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall be effective following adoption by the
Planning Commission and Council, after public hearing and certification to the
Recorder, as provided by law. Henceforth, any other regulations previously
adopted by Council or the City Planning Commission shall be deemed to be
repealed. These Subdivision Regulations shall in no way affect any subdivision
having received preliminary approval by the Commission prior to the effective
date, provided, however, that no changes to the preliminary plan, as approved,
are introduced by the subdivider. (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1103.09 AMENDMENTS.
   Council may, after public hearing, amend, supplement or change these
Subdivision Regulations. Notice shall be given of the time and place of such
public hearing by publication in at least one newspaper of general circulation
published in the local area thirty days prior to the holding of such hearing.
The amendment or amendments shall be on file in the office of the Planning
Commission for public examination during the thirty days.

1117.02
   1109.01 GENERAL.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of major, secondary
and minor streets or highways shall conform with the Official Highway Plan for
Dover, Ohio, which is on file with the Director of Public Service and with the
provisions of these Subdivision Regulations. Streets not contained in the
Official City Thoroughfare Plan should conform to the recommendation of the
Planning Commission based on existing and planned streets, topography, public
safety and convenience and proposed uses of land.
   Neighborhood unit type development is encouraged by the Commission. Where
large subdivisions designed on the basis of neighborhood units are being
reviewed, consideration will be given to the placement of commercial areas and
public areas, in relation both to the neighborhood unit being developed and to
other units that might be developed. Where small subdivisions are being
reviewed, the Planning Commission shall coordinate such subdivisions, to the
extent practicable, into units so that the same relationship with respect to
commercial areas and public areas may be realized. These design standards shall
be required in all areas except where special provisions are made for a
hillside area in excess of ten percent of slope. Any exceptions to the
provisions in this section which are made for hillside development are
specified in Chapter
1113. (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1109.02 STREETS.
   (a)    Design and Arrangement.
      (1)    The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provision for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
areas (or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided)
insofar as they may be deemed necessary for public requirements. Every
subdivision shall have access to a public right of way.
      (2)    The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide for convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be so
designed as to discourage through traffic, but offset streets should be
avoided.
      (3)    The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All other streets
should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible.
      (4)    The minimum curb radius at intersections subject to the approval
of the City Engineer shall be twenty percent (20%) of the right-of-way width
Curbing shall be required for all areas.
      (5)    Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through
traffic which may otherwise use secondary or major highways and whose origin
and destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending
for considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided.
   (b)    Alignment.
      (1)    Vertical. For main thoroughfares, profile grades shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length in multiples of fifty feet
approximately equivalent to twenty times the algebraic difference between the
rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred; for secondary and minor streets
and alleys, fifteen times.
         For slope areas where the average topographic slope is ten percent or
greater, refer to hillside regulations in Chapter
1113.
      (2)    Minimum horizontal. The radii of center line curvature shall be as
follows:
 
Primary Thoroughfares         twelve degrees       475 feet

Streets shorter than 500 feet fifty-eight degrees  100 feet
         A minimum 100-foot tangent shall be introduced between reverse
curves.    For slope areas where the average topographic slope is ten percent
or greater, refer to hillside regulations in Chapter
1113.
      (3)    Visibility requirements.
         A.    Minimum vertical visibility (measured four and one-half feet eye
level to a tail light eighteen inches above ground level.)
            500 feet on primary thoroughfares
            300 feet on secondary thoroughfares
            200 feet on minor streets
            100 feet on streets shorter than 500 feet.
            For slope areas where the average topographic slope is ten percent
or greater, refer to hillside regulations in Chapter
1113.
         B.    Minimum horizontal visibility shall be:
            500 feet on main thoroughfares measured on the center line
            300 feet on secondary thoroughfares measured on the center line
            100 feet on all other streets measured on the center line.
            For slope areas where the average topographic slope is ten percent
or greater, refer to hillside regulations in Chapter
1113.
   (c)    Street Type and Width.
      (1)    General conformance. The width of all major thoroughfares shall
conform to the width designated on the Major Highway Plan of Dover, Ohio.
      (2)    Secondary street widths. The minimum right-of-way widths of all
secondary streets shall be seventy feet.
      (3)    Local street widths. The minimum width of local streets shall be
fifty feet or sixty feet, dependent upon design consideration, density of
development and local conditions. The pavement widths shall be in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter
1111. Except where there are unusual topographical or other physical
conditions, the Commission may require greater widths or permit lesser widths
for rights of way and pavements for local streets. The minimum width of streets
serving multiple dwellings, commercial and industrial uses shall be seventy
feet and the pavement width shall be thirty-eight feet.
      (4)    Proximity of State highway. When a proposed subdivision is
adjacent to or contains a State highway, the developer and Commissioners should
seek information from the Ohio Department of Highways as to the status of the
highway in reference to width and direction, and also to access of such
highway.
      (5)    Half-streets. Dedication of new half-streets shall not be
permitted. Where a dedicated or platted half-street or alley exists adjacent to
the tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary
by the Commission.
      (6)    Cul-de-sacs. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turn around
having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty feet. The outside of the road
surface within the turn-around right of way shall have a minimum radius of
thirty-eight feet. The maximum length for a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet. The
minimum frontage or lot width shall be measured at the building line on any
cul-de-sac.
      (7)    Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets, designated to be so
permanently, shall not be permitted. Any dead-end street of a temporary nature,
if longer than 200 feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a surfaced
turning area equal in diameter to the width of such street at its termination.
      (8)    Marginal access streets.
         A.    Where a subdivision adjoins a major street and the greater
dimension of the block fronts along such major street or highway, a marginal
access street shall be designed to provide access to subdivided parcels.
            Points of access to the major street or highway shall be kept to a
minimum interval of 1,000 feet.
         B.    A planting strip of minimum width of twenty feet shall be
provided between the pavement of the major street or highway and the pavement
of the marginal access street.
         C.    The minimum width of the marginal access street shall be fifty
feet.
      (9)    Street grades. Street grades shall not exceed the following with
due allowances for reasonable vertical curves:

Secondary thoroughfare                        eight percent
Minor streets and alleys                      twelve percent
Streets shorter than 500 feet and cul-de-sacs fifteen percent
No street grade shall be less than .400 percent.
      (10)    Street names. New names are required for new streets in
unincorporated areas; the names shall meet with the approval of the City
Planning Commission. No name shall be similar in spelling or pronunciation to
that of an existing street in a postal zone. Streets which are essentially
contiguous shall have the same name.
      (11)    Acceptance of streets.
         A.    The approval of a plat by Council shall be deemed to be an
acceptance of the dedication of any public street, road or highway dedicated in
such plat.
         B.    The City Engineer shall check the construction by stages and if
the Engineer finds that such street is constructed in accordance with the
specifications set forth on the approved plat and that such street is in good
repair, then such finding, endorsed on the approved plat, shall constitute an
acceptance of the street for public use by the City.
            (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67; Ord. 42-82. Passed 9-20-82.)
   1109.021 ENTRANCE AND EXIT WAYS.
   (a)   Each use shall be permitted one two-way access driveway or two one-way
access driveways for each seventy-five feet of street and alley frontage of the
lot occupied by that use. Such access driveway shall be no less than ten feet
and no more than twenty feet for a one-way driveway, which shall be determined
at the span along the right of way, allowing for an additional ten feet of
radius at the roadway, which would not exceed a distance of thirty feet at the
roadway, or curb strip, and shall not be located less than fifteen feet from
the right- of-way line of an alley which intersects the same street or alley as
the proposed access driveways, or less than twenty-five feet from the right-of-
way line of a street which intersects the same street or alley as the proposed
access driveway. The access driveway, which is a two-way driveway, shall be not
less than twenty feet, but not more than forty feet along the right of way span
(back of the sidewalk), allowing for a radius not to exceed fifty feet at the
roadway, or curb strip, and shall not be located less than fifteen feet from
the right-of-way line of an alley which intersects the same street or alley as
the proposed access driveways, or less than twenty-five feet from the right-of-
way line of a street which intersects the same street or alley as the proposed
access driveway. No access driveway shall be located less than fifteen feet
from any other access driveway, which intersects the same alley or street as
the proposed access driveway.
   (b)   Off street parking areas shall be so designated that all required
parking spaces are accessible and that no parking or maneuvering incidental to
parking shall be on any street, alley or sidewalk.
(Ord. 23-15. Passed 7-20-15.)
   1109.03 ALLEYS.
   Alleys should be avoided in single or two-family districts. They may,
however, be required in multiple-dwelling developments where they should have a
minimum width of twenty feet. Alleys are required in the rear of all commercial
and industrial lots, if no other provisions are made for adequate service
access or for parking. The rights of way of such alleys shall not be less than
forty-five feet, and dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1109.04 BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)    Building Lines. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control
and is to be used for residential purposes, the building lines shall be
established according to the following table, but in no case shall the front
building line be less than thirty feet from the right of way of the street or
thoroughfare upon which the lots front.
 
 
                                         Minimum Average Distance
Lot Area                                 from Building Line to
                                         Road Right of Way
20,000 square feet and over              forty feet
13,600 square feet to 20,000 square feet thirty-five feet
7,500 square feet to 13,600 square feet  thirty feet
   Restrictions requiring greater setbacks than the above may be required for
commercial and industrial uses and for residential uses along major highways,
as determined by the Planning Commission.
   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is ten percent or
greater, refer to hillside regulations in Chapter
1113.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   (b)    Easements. Easements of at least seven feet in width shall be
provided on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where
necessary, for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains. Easements may also be
required along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions
may necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights
of way. For lots facing on curvilinear streets, the rear easement should
consist of straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection. (Ord.
45-67. Passed 8-7-67; Ord. 60-08. Passed 1-5-09.)
   1109.05 BLOCKS.
   (a)    No block shall be longer than 1,000 feet nor less than 500 feet,
except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress or egress.
   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is ten percent or
greater, refer to hillside regulations in Chapter
1113.
   (b)    Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk easement of not
less than ten feet in width on or near the halfway point may be required, if
necessary, to provide proper access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers
and other facilities.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1109.06 LOTS.
   (a)    The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all sublots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
   (b)    All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines, except where a variation to this subsection will
provide a better street and sublot layout. Lots with double frontage, except
when paralleling major highways, will be avoided.
   (c)    No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the Zoning
Code applying to the area in which it is located. If no zoning is in effect in
the township, the minimum average lot sizes shall conform to the Zoning Code
requirements which apply to comparable development within the City.
   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is ten percent or
greater, refer to hillside regulations in Chapter
1113.
   (d)    No lot shall be subdivided after acceptance of the original plat,
except as provided in the Zoning Code.
   (e)    In case of unusual soil conditions or other physical factors which
may impair the health and safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may
be located, upon recommendation of the County Board of Health or City Engineer,
the Planning Commission may require larger lot widths and lot areas as deemed
necessary or by the installation of an adequate sewage disposal plant.
   (f)    No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy-five feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a street
may be designated the front of a lot, provided the rear yard shall always be
opposite the frontage so designated.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   (g)    (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former subsection (g) was repealed by Ordinance 42-
82, passed September 20, 1982.)
   (h)   (1)   A lot drainage plan shall be submitted with the street utility
plans showing how each lot within the subdivision shall be graded, and what the
elevation of the ground surrounding each home will be. All lots and the
subdivision shall be graded in a manner which will provide home sites with
positive drainage away from the home on the lot and away from any other home in
the subdivision or adjacent subdivisions. Such positive drainage shall be
adequate enough to insure that no home in the subdivision or adjacent
subdivision is subject to flooding or ponding of surface waters.
      (2)   As homes in the subdivision are being constructed, the developer of
the subdivision shall be responsible to enforce the above positive drainage
requirements shown on the lot drainage plan. If the developer fails to enforce
such, the developer shall correct at his expense surface drainage problems that
occur due to his enforcement failure.
         (Ord. 60-08. Passed 1-5-09.)
   1109.07 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)    Consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably
located and of adequate size for playgrounds, school sites, parks and other
outdoor recreational facilities, as indicated on the Dover Comprehensive Plan
and to their being made available by one of the following methods:
      (1)    Dedication to public uses.
      (2)    Reservation of land for the use of property owners by deed or
covenants.
      (3)    Reservation for acquisition by a public agency within a period of
five years. Such reservation shall be made in such a manner as to provide for a
release of the land to the subdivider in the event no public agency proceeds
with the purchase.
   (b)    Due regard shall be shown for preserving outstanding cultural,
historic or natural features such as scenic spots, watercourses or
exceptionally fine groves of trees. Dedication to and acceptance by a public
agency is usually the best means of assuring their preservation.
   (c)    Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located
within the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall provide a permanent
easement of sufficient width dedicated to the proper authority for the purpose
of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream for
drainage or public use.
   (d)    As a safety measure for the protection of the health and welfare of
the people of the City, Council shall reserve the right to disapprove any
subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding, contains extremely poor
drainage facilities or has other physical impairment. However, if the
subdivider agrees to make such improvements as will make the area completely
safe for residential occupancy, provided that in lieu of the improvements the
subdivider shall furnish a surety bond or a certified check covering the cost
of the required improvements, the subdivision may be approved, subject,
however, to the approval of the County Board of Health, Conservancy District
and the City Engineer.

   1111.01 GENERAL.
   These minimum required improvements shall be required in all areas except
where special provisions are made for hillside areas in excess of a ten-percent
slope. Any exceptions to the provisions in this section which are made for
hillside development are specified in Chapter
1113.
   Prior to the granting of final approval, the subdivider shall have installed
or shall have furnished a performance bond for the amount of the estimated
construction cost of the ultimate installation of improvements listed and
described herein. The performance bond or cash deposit submitted to the
Director of Public Service will assure the City that the subdivider, his heirs,
successors and assigns, their agents or servants will comply with all
applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations, and will faithfully perform and complete the work of constructing
and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with such laws and
regulations. Before such bond is accepted, it shall be approved by the proper
administrative officials. The term of this bond shall extend twelve months
beyond completion date of the project.
   The subdivider or developer shall submit a set of construction plans for the
improvement of the road, street or alley and utility plans, prepared by a
registered professional engineer. The construction plans shall include the
title of plan, typical sections, plan and profile view and miscellaneous
engineering details. Cross sections will be submitted upon request by the City
Engineer. All typical sections and major engineering details to be used on any
particular road, street or alley shall be approved in advance by the City
Engineer or his representative before completion of the plans. When the
subdivider or developer submits for approval a construction plan for street
improvements for a part of a proposed subdivision area, preliminary street
grades, proposed drainage facilities and proposed utility extensions for the
entire subdivision area shall also be presented.
   When deemed desirable, the City Engineer or his representative may require
the construction or vacation of part or all of any intersecting roads, streets
or alleys in order to assure that no hardship or added expense be endured by
abutting property owners, the Township or City at some future date.
   All of the required improvements shall be made in full compliance with the
specifications for each of the various units of work as required by the City
Engineer or the County Board of Health, according to the nature of the
improvements. Upon final approval of the construction plans, a copy on
permanent reproducible material and five sets of all construction and utility
plans shall be submitted to the City. (Ord. 42-82. Passed 9-20-82.)
   1111.02 MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE.
   Unless otherwise indicated on the plans, with advance approval of the City
Engineer or his representative, materials shall meet the requirements and shall
be in accordance with the "Material Details" of the current volume of the
"Construction and Material Specifications," State of Ohio, Department of
Highways. The materials will be referred to by material grade or section number
of the same current volume.
   The specifications of the City shall in all respects govern all construction
work. The work shall be done under City supervision and inspection. It shall be
completed within the time fixed or agreed upon by the City Engineer.
   It shall be the responsibility of the City Engineer to inform the person or
persons making the same, to the effect that, whenever the required improvements
are properly made or otherwise secured as hereinafter mentioned, such Engineer
will pass upon and recommend to the City Planning Commission that such plat, if
otherwise conforming to these platting rules and regulations, be approved.
(Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1111.03 MONUMENTS.
   At the time of surveying and laying out a subdivision or addition to a
Municipal corporation, the proprietor of such subdivision or addition shall
plant at the corner of the public ground or lot, if there is such, and if there
is none, then at the corner of one of the in-lots and at the corner of each
out-lot, a good and sufficient stone of such size and dimensions and in such
manner as the surveyor provided for under Ohio R.C. 711.01 for a corner from
which to make future surveys, and the point at which it may be found shall be
designated on the plat.
   Such proprietor shall also set at least four permanent markers in each plat
of ten lots or less and not less than six permanent markers in each plat
containing over ten lots; iron pins shall be set at all lot corners. Such
permanent markers shall be of one-inch pipe or steel rods set in and running
through a concrete block at least six inches in diameter and at least thirty-
six-inches long, and the bottom of such concrete block shall be set at least
thirty-six inches deep, below finished grade in the plat, and the points at
which they may be found shall be designated on the plat.
   The perimeter corners of each out-lot shall be concrete monuments of
rectangular truncated prisms six inches by six inches at the top and eight
inches by eight inches at the base and forty-eight inches long, with tops six
inches above finish grade and carrying a
permanent marked point in the top surface. (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1111.04 UTILITY AND STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)    Water Lines.
      (1)    Public water supply. Where public water supply is available as
determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider or developer shall
construct a system of water mains and connect it with such public water supply
and provide a connection for each lot. All new streets shall be improved with
six-inch water lines, provided, however, that the Planning Commission in its
discretion may require larger lines within the subdivision where necessary or
desirable. In such case, the excess cost of the larger lines shall be borne by
the developer. Where larger line sizes are required for servicing areas outside
the subdivision, the excess cost of the larger lines shall be borne by the
City.
      (2)    Test wells. Where public water supply is not available, at least
one test well shall be made in the area being platted for each 100 lots or each
twenty-five acres of area, whichever is the smaller. In cases where copies of
the logs of existing wells located within the area being platted are available,
this may be submitted in lieu of making test wells. Test wells shall be at
least twenty-five feet in depth and shall produce safe potable drinking water
at a rate of not less than five gallons per minute per family.
   A copy of the well log, which shall include the name and address of the well
driller, shall be submitted with the plat to the Planning Commission.
      (3)    Location and construction of individual private wells. Individual
private wells shall be located at least twenty-five feet from property lines;
fifty feet from all septic tanks, approximately fifty feet from all tile
disposal fields and other sewage disposal facilities; ten feet from all cast
iron, vitrified or equivalent watertight pipe, as approved by the County Board
of Health; and shall not be located within any flood plain unless the source is
above the flood level and properly sealed.
   As a precaution against seepage, an approved watertight seal shall be
provided around the pump mounting.
   All abandoned wells shall be sealed in a manner that will render them
watertight as prescribed by the County Health Department.
   In all cases where it has been determined that individual water supplies
from private wells are not feasible, a public water distribution system will be
required.
      (4)    Public water distribution systems. Public wells and other public
water distribution systems shall meet the requirements of the State Department
of Health as cited in Ohio R.C. 3701.18 to 3701.21, inclusive.
   (b)    Sanitary Sewers.
      (1)    Sanitary sewers. If a subdivision can be reasonably served by the
extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the
Commission, the subdivider or developer shall provide a system of sanitary
sewer mains and shall provide lateral connections for each lot. Any area or
subdivision of ten or more housing units must have a central sewerage system,
approved by the Ohio Department of Health and accepted by Council. Where a
public sanitary sewer is not reasonably accessible, the subdivider, the owner
or the developer may provide a package plant for the group or septic tanks for
each lot, provided that such package plants or septic tanks are installed in
accordance with State and County or local Board of Health requirements.
Whenever main lines are installed, sewer and water shall be extended to
property lines. Connections to public sanitary sewer lines shall be subject to
the approval of and according to the specifications of the City Engineer.
Eight-inch sewer lines will normally be required, but the Planning Commission
may, at its discretion, require larger lines where necessary or desirable. In
such case, the excess cost of the larger lines shall be borne by the City.
      (2)    Individual sewage disposal facilities. In the event the
installation of individual disposal systems shall be considered, the absorption
ability of the soil, surface drainage and topography shall be the criteria for
determining whether or not the installation of individual septic tank disposal
systems is permissible. At least one percolation test shall be made for each
lot area being platted, and each test shall be located in close proximity to
the proposed sewage disposal unit. Each test shall be numbered and its location
shown on the plat. Tests shall be made by an authority recognized by the County
Health Department.
   The general types of soil encountered in making the tests and the depth of
ground water, if found, shall be documented and submitted with the plat
together with the actual percolation time of each test hole and the name and
address of the registered engineer or surveyor or other qualified persons
acceptable to the County Health Department making the test and the dates on
which they were made.
      (3)    Percolation tests. All percolation tests shall be performed in
accordance with the requirements of the City Planning Commission and the County
Board of Health.
         The percolation test shall be made by the following method:
         A.    Dig or bore holes approximately six to ten inches wide, straight
sides to a minimum depth of thirty inches or a maximum depth of forty-eight
inches.
         B.    Keep filling holes with water until ground becomes soaked and
allow all water to seep away. Then fill holes with water to a depth of twelve
inches.
         C.    Record the time, in minutes, required for the last six inches of
water to completely seep away. Divide the time by six to obtain the average
time for water to fall one inch.
         D.    Determine the size of tile disposal field:
 
                          Lineal Feet of Tile Required
Average Time Required for
Water to Fall One Inch as Type of Leaching Soil 2 or less 3 to 4   5 to 6

Over sixty minutes        Leaching devices are not permitted.
 
The general types of soil encountered in making the test and the depth of
ground water, if found, shall be documented and submitted with the plat
together with the actual percolation time of each test hole and the names and
addresses of the registered surveyor and/or engineer making the test, as well
as the dates on which they were made.
      (4)    Public sewer distribution systems. Group sewage disposal systems
shall meet the requirements of the State Department of Health as prescribed by
the laws of Ohio.
   (c)    Drainage. All necessary facilities, including underground pipe,
inlets, catch basins or open drainage ditches, shall be installed to provide
for the adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water and maintenance of
natural drainage courses. All storm drainage facilities within the subdivision
shall connect to an adequate drainage outlet. A drainage plan shall be
submitted simultaneously with the plat of any subdivision, showing the proposed
scheme of surface drainage.
      (1)    Standards and specifications for drainage facilities. The
construction of storm water drainage improvements shall be subject to the
approval of the City Engineer.
      (2)    Storm sewers and storm water. A drainage system adequate to serve
the needs of the proposed new streets and the entire subdivision will be
required in the new subdivisions. Where an adequate public storm sewer main is
available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer
system and connect with such storm sewer main. If such storm sewer systems are
not accessible, adequate storm water drainage shall be provided by natural
drainage channels with easements of adequate width as approved by the City
Engineer.
      (3)    Culverts and bridges. When natural drainage channels intersect any
street right of way, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to have
satisfactory bridges and culverts designed and constructed. Where culverts are
required, the following minimum requirements shall be observed: 
         A.    Where drainage ditches are permitted, they must have at least
0.20 of a foot grade per 100 feet, or otherwise approved.
         B.    If the permitted roadway ditch is in excess of two percent, an
approved type gutter using concrete, stone, sod or underground drainage must be
used, with sufficient inlets spaced so as to keep the volume of water at a low
level. All culverts shall extend across the entire right-of-way width of the
proposed road. The cover over the culvert and its capacity shall be approved by
the City Engineer. The minimum diameter of a culvert pipe shall be twelve
inches. Head walls, depending on existing drainage conditions, may be required.
         C.    Driveway culverts shall have a minimum length of twenty feet.
Driveway culverts shall be double strength vitrified pipe or equal, with scaled
joints having a diameter of not less than twelve inches. When special drainage
designs are necessary, such as masonry or concrete structures, etc., such
designs in detail must be submitted to the City Engineer and Conservancy
District for approval in advance of the completion of the construction plans.
The driveway culverts shall be laid so as to maintain the flow line of the
ditch or gutter. Head walls may be required.
         D.    All trenches for water lines, sewers, utilities, etc., within
the pavement or driveway areas, shall be backfilled with grit to a point within
a minimum of six inches of the subgrade and to a point three feet outside the
pavement edge or three feet back of the curb, if curb is used. (Ord. 45-67.
Passed 8-7-67.)
      (4)    Subsurface water drains. Drain lines for conveying subsurface
water shall be installed in all subdivisions that are constructed on moderate
or poorly drained soils (clay, silt, shale, etc.) as defined by the United
States Soil Conservation Report for Tuscarawas County. Where subdivisions are
constructed on well drained soils (sand and gravel) as defined by the same
soils report, drain lines for conveying subsurface water will not be required.
Also, wherever subdivisions have creeks in them to which subsurface water can
be directly discharged, drain lines will not be required.
         A.    The subject drain lines shall be polyvinyl chloride plastic pipe
with o-ring joints conforming to the latest requirements of A.S.T.M. D 3034 and
A.S.T.M. D 3212 and have a minimum Standard Dimension Ration (SDR) of 35. The
minimum size of the drain lines shall be six inches in diameter and shall be
large enough to convey all of the subsurface waters which they are receiving.
The pipe shall be installed in an encasement of pea gravel which shall extend a
minimum of four inches below the pipe and above the pipe. The pipe lines shall
be installed on each side of the street, where such is required, between the
curbs and sidewalks at a distance of two feet from the back of the curbs.
         B.    Subsurface waters from springs, seep holes and basement sump
pumps shall be piped into the subject lines from each source or home from which
it emanates. The drain lines themselves shall be connected into the street
storm sewer catch basins wherever they occur.
         C.    In the case where creeks are located adjacent to lot boundaries,
springs, seep holes and basement sump pumps shall be piped directly into the
creeks.
         D.   It is the intent of this subsection (4) to convey all subsurface
waters in a subdivision via pipe lines to the storm drainage system for the
subdivision, and to prohibit the discharge of any subsurface waters to flow
openly into the streets of the subdivision.
            (Ord. 37-94. Passed 5-2-94.)
   (d)    Street Improvements. All streets and thoroughfares shall be graded to
their full width, including side slopes and improved in accordance with the
standards outlined or referred to in these Subdivision Regulations, except that
the street improvements for areas remotely situated with respect to City
services may conform to the standards specified in the Subdivision Regulations
of Tuscarawas County.
(1)    Width of pavement. The width of pavement will vary, depending upon the
character of the development served and the amount of traffic expected to
utilize the street.
The following are the minimum street pavement widths:
Type of Streets                        Right of Way        Width of Pavement
Urban:
Major streets and highways             eighty feet or over Variable*
Secondary and collector streets        seventy feet        thirty-eight feet
Local streets serving medium- (six
families per net acre or more) density sixty feet          thirty-six feet
suburban development
Local streets serving low-density      fifty feet          thirty feet
suburban development
Alleys                                 twenty feet         sixteen feet
Rural areas remotely situated with respect to City sewers:
Secondary rural roads                  seventy feet        twenty-two feet
Local rural roads                      sixty feet          twenty feet
   *To conform to the applicable standards of the Major Highway Plan, as
determined by the City Planning Commission and the City Engineer.
In certain instances, especially where a commercial area is involved and no
off-street parking facilities are provided and no parking is permitted on the
street at any time, a parking lane at least eight feet wide on each side of the
street and paved to the satisfaction of and in accordance with the
specifications approved by the City Engineer may be required in addition to the
necessary number of lanes for moving traffic. Where pavement widths greater
than those specified above are necessary, provisions of the same shall be
discussed with the public officials having jurisdiction over the planning and
construction of public ways to determine whether or not public expenditures for
such additional width can or should be made simultaneously with the
subdivider's improvement program.
      (2)    Subgrade. The subgrade shall be free of sod, vegetation or other
similar material. Where poor subsurface drainage conditions exist, adequate
drainage shall be installed. The subgrade shall be rolled with a roller of not
less than seven tons in weight. Sub-base grade tolerance shall be not more than
one inch in sixteen feet. Sub-base construction shall be subject to the
approval of the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
      (3)    Pipe underdrains. Pipe underdrains shall be placed on each side of
the street 1'-0" behind the curbs and at a depth which will provide 1'6" of
aggregate cover over the top of the pipe. The trench excavated for the
underdrains shall be excavated to provide a 1'0" wide opening to a depth which
will provide 4" of aggregate under the pipe. The trench shall be completely
filled with No. 57 size gravel. The aggregate shall extend to the top of the
gutters of the curbs and over to the back of the curbs and the edge of the
street base course. Underdrain pipe shall be either perforated concrete pipe,
perforated vitrified clay pipe or perforated polyvinyl chloride plastic pipe.
The underdrain pipe shall be connected into the storm water drainage system for
the streets. Pipe underdrains shall be perforated P.V.C. pipe with a minimum of
four (4) rows of perforations. The pipe and fittings shall conform to ASTM
F758, Type PS46 and as applicable, to Item 605 of the latest edition of the
State of Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and Materials
Specifications.
(Ord. 60-08. Passed 1-5-09.)
         A.   Pipe underdrains for streets shall be installed where streets are
constructed on top of moderate and poorly drained soils (clay, silt, shale,
etc.) as defined by the United States Soil Conservation Report for Tuscarawas
County. Where streets are constructed on top of well drained soils (sand and
gravel) as defined by the same soils report, pipe underdrains will not be
required.
      (4)   Base course. A compaction test on road sub base shall be required
prior to acceptance by the City for installation of a new asphalt base. The
base course for streets shall consist of a four inch layer of asphaltic
concrete placed on top of the limestone. Both layers shall be individually
compacted in place with a vibratory roller. Unless otherwise stated herein, the
limestone aggregate shall conform to item 304 of the latest edition of the
State of Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and Material
Specifications, and the asphaltic concrete shall conform to item 301 of the
latest edition of the State of Ohio Department of Transportation Construction
and Material Specifications.
         A.   Depending upon the soil conditions and the type of traffic which
the street is expected to receive, the City may require, in its discretion,
greater thickness for the base courses.
         B.   Streets constructed over moderately or poorly drained soils
(including, but not limited to clay, silt, or shale), as said term is defined
by the United States Soil Conservation Report for Tuscarawas County, shall
require a four inch thick layer of limestone aggregate base course. Streets
constructed over well drained soils (including but not limited to sand and
gravel), as said term is defined by the United States Soil Conservation Report
for Tuscarawas County, shall not require a limestone aggregate base course.
         C.   In those circumstances wherein a limestone aggregate base course
is required, said base course shall extend to the underside of the concrete
gutters, having a minimum thickness there under of four inches.
      (5)   Surface course. The surface course for streets shall consist of a
three inch thick layer of asphaltic concrete applied in layers of 1 3/4 inch
and 1 1/4 inch layers, compacted in place with a vibratory roller. Unless
otherwise noted herein, the asphaltic concrete surface course shall conform to
item 404 of the latest edition of the State of Ohio Department of
Transportation Construction and Material Specifications.
         A.   Such asphaltic concrete surface shall not be constructed until
all ditches have settled and the street surface is approved by the City, but
not later than eighteen months following the installation of water mains, sewer
mains, lateral sewers and service lines.
         B.   The right is reserved to the City to determine the proper type
and time for the application of the surface course, but in no event will the
subdivider be required to defer the construction of the surface course for a
period in excess of that specified by the City for the completion of the
required improvements as provided in subsection (j) hereof. The subdivider
shall give three days’ notice to the City as to the time when the construction
of the base and surface courses is to be started so that the work may be
inspected by the City or its duly authorized agents. After the final rolling,
the street or road shall be closed to traffic for twenty-four hours. (Ord. 26-
02. Passed 5-20-02.)
      (6)    Concrete pavement. If the subdivider elects to construct concrete
pavement or if such type pavement is required by the City in order to meet
traffic needs, such concrete pavement shall have a minimum thickness of eight
inches and shall meet Item 451, Reinforced Portland Cement Concrete Pavement,
of the latest edition of the State of Ohio Department of Transportation
Construction and Material Specifications.
      (7)    Curbs and gutters. Concrete curbs and gutters are required on all
new streets; except, the City may choose to delete such on streets serving
industrial parks or similar uses. Where curbs are not required, adequate
drainage ditches shall be graded and protected by seeding or appropriate
surfacing. Curbs and gutters shall conform to the applicable parts of Chapter
902 of these Codified Ordinances.
      (8)    Driveways. The maximum grade on driveways shall not exceed ten
percent (10%). Driveway pipe shall be concrete pipe with a minimum diameter of
twelve inches and a minimum length of twenty feet, or larger as required by the
drainage condition and the City. The subdivider or developer shall place
approved drainage structures under intersecting roads, drives, lanes or
property entrances and at other locations, where required. (Ord. 37-94. Passed
5-2-94.)
 
   (e)    Utilities and Other Improvements. Electrical service, gas mains and
other utilities should be provided within each subdivision. Whenever such
facilities are reasonably accessible and available, they may be required to be
installed within the area as required. Trees may be planted along the streets
outside the right of way. (Ord. 5-85. Passed 2-18-85.)
   (f)    Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks having a minimum width of four feet and
having a minimum thickness of four inches shall be installed on both sides of
all new streets. However, the Planning Commission together with Council
pursuant to subsection (f)(l) herein may waive this requirement and allow
sidewalks along only one side of any new street where it determines that
sidewalks on both sides of such new street are not necessary. Council may
reject a plat where sidewalks have been waived pursuant to this provision
unless Council by resolution has given authorization to the Planning Commission
for the waiver as set forth above. Beyond the corporation limits, in areas
where the predominant lot width is 100 feet or more, the Planning Commission,
at its discretion and without consultation with Council may waive the
requirement for any sidewalks.
      (1)    When the Planning Commission receives a preapplication sketch
requesting a waiver for sidewalks in a subdivision in the City pursuant to the
above paragraph, the Commission shall immediately notify Council together with
its recommendation and Council shall then consider the waiver request. In the
event that Council, by resolution, approves the waiver request and finds that
such waiver would not substantially detract from the purpose and intent of the
Dover City Planning Code, then the Planning Commission may proceed with the
preliminary application as set forth in the preceding paragraph. If, however,
Council shall reject the proposed waiver, then the Planning Commission shall
not grant the waiver requested for the subdivision, but shall then proceed to
consider the preliminary plat for all other purposes as set forth above.
      (2)    No waiver of sidewalk requirements as set forth in this subsection
(f) shall be granted except by the above procedure and except as included on
the preliminary plat submitted pursuant to Section
1107.02.
         (Ord. 74-89. Passed 10-16-89.)
      (3)   Sidewalks shall be installed on a lot within one year after a
building permit has been issued, or two years after the subdivision developer
has sold or transferred a lot if no building permit has been issued. If a lot
has not been sold or transferred within a two-year period by the developer, or
the sidewalk has not been installed within one year of the issuance of the
building permit, the Building and Zoning Codes Administrator may grant a
sidewalk completion time waiver, if requested in writing by the developer, and
if the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Dover will not be
adversely impacted. The waiver may be granted in twelve-month increments.
(Ord. 60-08. Passed 1-5-09.)
   (g)    Street Name Signs. Street name signs of a type similar to those in
use throughout the City, shall be erected by the City at all intersections.
   (h)    Street Lighting. Plans for street lights, if any, shall be submitted
to the City Engineer for approval.
   (i)    Trench Backfilling. All trenches for water lines, sewers, utilities,
etc., within the pavement or driveway areas shall be backfilled with granular
material to a point within a minimum of six inches of the subgrade and to a
point three feet outside the pavement edge or three feet back of the curb, if
curb is used.
   (j)    Improvements Bond. The improvements and standards therefor described
in Chapters
1109 and
1111 have been adopted by Council and no final subdivision shall be approved
unless:
      (1)    The improvements listed in the sections of these Subdivision
Regulations have been satisfactorily completed prior to such approval; or
      (2)    The subdivider shall file with the Director of Public Service a
surety bond, cashier's or certified check for the estimated amount of
construction cost which shall be approved by the City Engineer, guaranteeing to
the City that such improvements will be constructed and completed in a
satisfactory manner and within a period specified by the City Engineer, but
such period shall not exceed one year beyond completion. Such bond or checks
shall be approved by the City Solicitor and shall be made payable to and
enforceable by the City.
   Upon satisfactory completion of the improvements and approval of the same in
writing by the City Engineer and with the presentation of letters of
certification of payment in full of all contractors, subcontractors, suppliers
of materials, engineers, surveyors and all inspection fees or other fees
incurred by the installation of the improvements by the subdivider, the bonds
may be released in writing by the Clerk of the City or the cashier's or
certified check may be returned to the developer.
   (k)    Provisions for Maintenance and Operation. Where the subdivision
contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas,
street trees or other physical facilities necessary or desirable for the
welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit and which are of
such character that the City or other public agency does not desire to maintain
them, provisions shall be made by trust agreements, which are a part of the
deed restrictions and which are acceptable to the City Planning Commission for
the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such facilities by the
lot owners in the subdivisions. (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   (l)    Any new street developed by a private developer and dedicated to the
City shall have a street tree plan approved by the Shade Tree Commission. As an
alternative, the developer may permit the Shade Tree Commission to develop the
street tree plan with the cost of all trees to be paid by the developer. In
either case, the improvements bond required in subsection (j) hereof shall
include an amount sufficient to cover the cost of compliance with such plan as
estimated by the Shade Tree Commission. (Ord. 5-85. Passed 2-18-85.)

   "Hillside area", as referred to herein, means an area with an average slope
of ten percent or more. These Regulations apply to all hillside areas with an
added limitation that areas with a slope of forty percent or greater are
considered extremely rugged and development shall be limited to lots of two
acres or more, and require the approval of the Planning Commission. (Ord. 45-
67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1113.02 DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE SLOPE.
   The average slope for any hillside development shall be determined by the
Planning Commission during the time of preliminary subdivision design.
Determination will be on an area-by-area basis, with each lot sized according
to the average topographic change falling within each area. (Ord. 45-67. Passed
8-7-67.)
   1113.03 MINIMUM LOT AREA REGULATIONS PER FAMILY.
   The minimum lot regulations per family (graph following) shall be used to
determine minimum lot area in thousands of square feet once the average percent
of slope is determined by the Planning Commission. The example in this table is
for a lot whose natural ground slope is eighteen percent, the indicated lot
area is 12,000 square feet, and the indicated average width is eighty-five
feet. Rounding should be made to the nearest five-foot intervals.

   No land shall be graded, cut or filled so as to create a slope exceeding a
vertical rise of one foot for each three feet of horizontal distance between
abutting lots; it may only be permitted within a lot where a retaining wall of
sufficient height and thickness is provided to retain the graded bank.
   Major cuts, excavation, grading and filling, where the same materially
changes the site and its relationship with surrounding areas or materially
affects such areas, shall not be permitted if such excavation, grading and
filling will result in a slope exceeding a vertical rise of one foot for each
three feet of horizontal distance between abutting lots or between adjoining
tracts of land, except where adequate provision is made to prevent slides and
erosion by cribbing and retaining walls. (Ord. 45-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
   1113.08 COMPACTION OF FILL.
   All fill shall be compacted to a density of ninety percent or greater.

1114.15   Penalties not exclusive.
   1114.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)    The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the health, safety
and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Dover through the regulation
of illicit discharges and new discharges to the municipal storm water sewer
system (MS4). These regulations establish methods for controlling the
introduction of pollutants into the storm water system in order to comply with
requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit process, as required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA).
   (b)    Specifically these regulations have been formulated to provide
compliance with the City of Dover's Ohio EPA Permit to Authorize Small MS4's to
Discharge Storm Water Under the NPDES. As such, provisions of this chapter have
been written to assure compliance with the technical requirements of the Ohio
EPA General Permit to Authorize Storm Water Discharges Associated with
Construction Activity Under the NPDES.
   (c)   As of the writing of this chapter, the current Ohio EPA Permit to
Authorize Small MS4's to Discharge Storm Water is NPDES Permit No. OHQ000004
and the current Ohio EPA General Permit to Authorize Storm Water Discharges
Associated with Construction Activity is NPDES Permit No. OHC000005. If either
of these permits are superceded by a more recent version, the new version shall
govern. All references to the old permit number in this chapter shall be
replaced by the new permit number.
   (d)    If any provisions of this chapter are found to be in conflict with
the aforementioned Ohio EPA permits, the following shall apply.
      (1)    If the chapter is more stringent or more restrictive than the Ohio
EPA permits, the chapter shall govern.
      (2)    If any provisions of this chapter are found to be less stringent
or less restrictive than the Ohio EPA permits, the minimum standards found in
the Ohio EPA permits shall govern.
   The requirements found in the aforementioned Ohio EPA permits are intended
to be the minimum standards stipulated in this chapter.
   (e)    The objectives of these regulations are to prohibit illicit
discharges and illegal connections and to regulate new discharges to the MS4,
and to establish legal authority to carry out inspections, monitoring
procedures and enforcement actions necessary to ensure compliance with these
regulations.
(Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-21.)

to maintain a nuisance on their property, and compliance with the provisions of
this Chapter shall not be a defense in any action to abate such nuisance.
   (d)    Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions, or to recommend corrective measures, shall not relieve the Owner/
Operator from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting
therefrom and shall not result in the City, its officers, employees or agents
being responsible for any condition or damage
resulting therefrom. (Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-21.)
   1114.06 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.
    The City shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this
Chapter. The City may contract with the Tuscarawas County Board of Health or
other outside agency to conduct inspections, monitor and assist with
enforcement actions.
(Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-21.)
   1114.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)    Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No Owner/Operator shall discharge,
or cause to be discharged, any illicit discharge into the City's MS4. The
commencement, conduct or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is
prohibited; except as herein described:
      (1)    Waterline flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from firefighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City to be
significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)    Discharges specified, in writing, by the City as being necessary
to protect public health and safety.
   (b)    Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, but is not limited to, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection. An Owner/Operator is considered to be in violation of this
regulation if the Owner/Operator connects a line conveying illicit discharges
to the MS4, or allows such connection to continue. (Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-
21.)
   1114.08 REGULATED NEW ACTIVITIES
   (a)   This chapter requires that when a proposed soil disturbing activity
such as a land clearing, grading, excavating and filling project on land used
or being developed, either wholly or partially, for residential, commercial,
recreational, industrial or other proposes consisting of one (1) or more
contiguous acres of land owned by one person, group or corporation, or operated
as one development unit for the construction of buildings, structures,
utilities, recreational facilities, subdivisions or other non farm uses, the
owner of said land shall prepare and submit to the City of Dover a Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). Soil disturbing activities that disturb less
than one (1) acre, but are a part of a larger common plan of development, or
sale, that will disturb more than one (1) acre, shall also require the
submittal of a SWPPP.
   (b)    Areas of soil disturbing activity of less than one (1) contiguous
acre and are not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, that
will disturb more than one (1) acre, do not require the preparation and
submittal of a SWPPP. However, these areas are not exempt from the provisions
of this chapter, which requires for all areas the installation and maintenance
of erosion and sediment control practices to prevent sediment from depositing
into local rivers, creeks, channels, ditches, ponds, storm sewers or onto
existing landowners' properties and existing alleys, streets, roads or
highways.
   (c)    During active and inactive construction sequences of soil disturbance
activities, soils shall be stabilized and protected from erosion and sediment
in a manner that all private and public properties, natural and artificial
waterways, wetlands and storm sewers are protected.
   (d)    The owner proposing soil disturbing activities consisting of one (1)
or more contiguous acres shall also submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) application
to the Ohio EPA and receive a Construction General Permit from the Ohio EPA
authorizing storm water discharges associated with construction activity under
Ohio EPA Permit No. OHC000005, or its most rccent subsequent version. In
addition to the requirements stated in this chapter, the said owner shall also
comply with all of the permit conditions contained in the above said Ohio EPA
permit.
   (e)    Erosion and sediment control, and storm runoff control practices used
to satisfy the performance criteria of this chapter shall meet the
specifications provided herein, and meet the standards and specifications in
the current edition of Ohio's Rainwater and Land Development, Ohio's Standards
for Storm Water Management, Land Development and Urban Stream Protection
manual.
   (f)    The SWPPP plan shall be submitted to the City of Dover for review no
less than thirty (30) days before any soil disturbing activity at the proposed
site. A copy of the Ohio EPA NOI application and a copy of its application
check shall also be submitted to the City of Dover with the SWPPP.
   (g)    The submitted plan must be approved by the City of Dover before the
start of any soil disturbing activity. The plan must be designed by and sealed
by a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio.
   (h)    The SWPPP plan shall be signed by the owner proposing the soil
disturbing activities, and all reports associated with the SWPPP shall be
signed by said owner or his written designated representative. A separate
written document containing the signatures of all contractors and sub-
contractors involved in the implementation of the SWPPP must be maintained as
proof acknowledging that they reviewed and understand the conditions and
responsibilities of the SWPPP. This document shall be created, and signatures
obtained prior to commencement of work by the contractor or sub-contractor on
the construction site.
   (i)    The land owner or his delegated representative shall maintain a
written record of all SWPPP plan activities and compliance inspections. The
first inspection to certify that the erosion and sediment control practices
comply with the approved SWPPP plan shall be not later than two (2) working
days after the start of the project. Thereafter, all control devices shall be
inspected at least once every seven (7) calendar days and within twenty-four
(24) hours after any storm event greater than one-half (1/2) of an inch of rain
during a twenty-four (24) hour period.
   (j)   All soil disturbing activities that require an SWPPP as defined by
this chapter, shall require a preconstruction conference with the City of Dover
to ensure that all conditions of this chapter and the SWPPP are understood and
followed. During construction, the City shall make periodic inspections to
ensure that all provisions of the SWPPP are adhered to. These inspections by
the City's representative are in addition to those required by the owner in (i)
above. Any deviations from the SWPPP found during said inspections shall be
corrected to provide compliance with the SWPPP in a timely fashion. Connections
shall be subject to the same criteria and penalties noted in subsequent
Sections
 1114.13 and
1114.14.

fueling;
         J.    Location of construction entrances;
         K.    Location of any in-stream activity, including stream crossings.
Water ponding facilities should be drawn to scale.
      (3)    Nonstructural Preservation Methods: A description of practices
which preserve existing natural conditions as much as feasible (the phasing of
operations to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, designated
tree preservation areas, etc.)
      (4)    Erosion Controls: Erosion controls must be capable of providing
cover over disturbed soils. The SWPPP must provide specifications (seed type,
application rates, etc.) for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site
and provide guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for
any time of the year.
Temporary stabilization must be applied:
         A.    Within seven (7) days of last disturbance on any area that will
lie dormant for fourteen (14) days or longer, but less than one (1) year, (in
case of a residential subdivision, at least seven (7) days prior to transfer of
permit coverage for the individual lot);
         B.    Within two (2) days on any areas within fifty (50) feet of a
stream that will remain idle for more than fourteen (14) days; and
         C.    Prior to the onset of winter in those areas that will be idle
over winter.
         Permanent stabilization must be applied to any area:
         A.    Within seven (7) days of reaching final grade;
         B.    Within seven (7) days for areas that will lie dormant for one
(1) year or more; or
         C.    Within two (2) days of reaching final grade within fifty (50)
feet of a stream.
      (5)    Runoff Controls: The SWPPP shall incorporate measures to control
runoff flows from disturbed areas to prevent soil erosion by directing the
flows from exposed soils and steep slopes. Examples include rock check dams,
pipe slope drains, and diversion berms and trenches.
      (6)    Sediment Control: Any site remaining disturbed more than fourteen
(14) days must have structural sediment controls. Sediment basins and perimeter
sediment barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from start of grubbing. Such controls must remain functional until the
upslope area is restabilized. No sediment controls shall be placed in a stream.
Detail drawings must be provided of all structural control practices. This
should include outlet and inlet structures for detention/retention facilities
including modifications to those facilities to aid in sediment removal.
Installation instructions, such as installing silt fence along the contours and
curving it upslope at the ends, must be included. Sediment controls include the
following:
         A.    Sediment Settling Ponds - Concentrated runoff and runoff from
drainage areas which exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet
protection shall pass through sediment settling ponds. In addition, all common
drainage locations serving ten (10) disturbed acres or more at one time must
maintain a sediment pond until final stabilization of the site. Ponds shall be
sized at sixty-seven (67) cubic yards per total contributing drainage acre;
have a depth less than or equal to five (5) feet; and have the distance between
inlet and outlet at least a 2:1 length:width ratio. The SWPPP must include
provisions to remove sediment when the pond's capacity is reduced by fifty
percent (50%). Sediment settling ponds shall further comply with the provisions
of the most recent edition of Ohio EPA General Permit Authorization for Storm
Water Discharges Associated with Construction Activity.
         B.    Silt Fence/Diversions - Sheet flow from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent property. Silt
fence is limited to sheet flow situations and shall be placed on a level
contour. The maximum drainage area behind silt fence shall not exceed one half
(½) acre per 100 lineal feet of silt fence for less than two percent (2%)
slope. For areas of greater slope the maximum drainage area shall be reduced as
per the table in the most recent edition of Ohio EPA General Permit
Authorization for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction Activity.
Where the above criteria is exceeded, a diversion directing runoff to a
sediment settling pond is indicated.
         C.    Inlet Protection - Unless the storm drain system drains to a
sediment settling pond, practices shall be implemented to minimize sediment-
laden water entering active storm drain systems. If the permittee chooses not
to use structural curb inlet protection, it is imperative that a successful
program be maintained utilizing other controls such as silt fence across lot
frontage, prompt stabilization. street cleaning, and on-lot construction
entrances.
         D.    Stream Protection - Structural practices shall be implemented to
protect all adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment laden runoff.
         E.    Trench and Ground Water Controls - A trench or ground water
which contains sediment must pass through a sediment settling pond or other
equally effective sediment control device. Alternatively, sediment may be
removed by settling in place, dewatering into a sump pit, filter bag or
comparable practice. Groundwater dewatering which does not contain sediment or
other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. A non-
erosive channel must be provided to convey this water from the site. There
shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters of the state resulting from
dewatering activities.
         F.    Off-Site Traffic - Off-site vehicle tracking of sediments and
dust generation shall be minimized.
         G.    Subdivision Lots - Where the SWPPP does not call for a
centralized sediment control capable of controlling runoff from multiple lots,
a detail drawing of a typical lot showing standard lot erosion and sediment
control practices must be provided.
      (7)    Inspections: The SWPPP plan shall contain written statements
requiring inspections to be made and recorded at the intervals heretofore
stated in Section
1114.08(i).
      (8)    Maintenance: The SWPPP shall contain a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of controls. Controls
must be repaired and maintained as needed to ensure continued performance of
their intended function. They must remain functional until all upslope areas
are permanently stabilized. Sediment ponds must be repaired/maintained within
ten (10) days of inspection. All other controls must be repaired/maintained
within three (3) days of inspection. Documentation of when repairs and
maintenance occur should become part of the inspection record. Maintenance
plans shall be as further delineated in Section
 1114.10(i).
      (9)    Post-Construction Storm Water Management: The SWPPP must contain a
description of the post-construction facilities that shall be installed during
construction of the project, including detailed drawings and notes pertaining
to the operation of the facilities. Copies of these plans shall be given by the
permittee to the post-construction operator of the facilities upon completion
of construction. Design of post-construction storm water facilities shall meet
the hereinafter presented requirements.
         (Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-21.)
   1114.10 POST-CONSTRUCTION FACILITIES.
   (a)    General: New commercial sites, industrial sites and residential
subdivisions as well as existing, downstream properties shall be protected from
flood hazard and inundation by storm waters. Existing watercourses either
originating in or flowing through a new commercial site, industrial site or
residential subdivision shall be received and discharged from the development
as nearly as possible at the rate, which existed prior to construction. Runoff
from a new commercial site, industrial site or residential subdivision shall be
drained to an adequate outlet. This outlet or termini location must be approved
by the City of Dover and shall consist of a channel, stream, river, storm
sewer, pond, lake or dedicated public drainage easement.
   Post-construction storm water management shall be accomplished through the
use of Best Management Practices that follow the requirements specified herein
and as delineated in the most recent edition of Ohio EPA General Permit
Authorization for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction Activity.
   The hydraulic design and construction of drainage facilities shall be
subject to the approval of the City of Dover. Grading within a new subdivision
shall provide positive drainage for all lots. Depth of flow or ponding within a
new subdivision shall not exceed a level which would cause inundation of
foundations or basements of residences.
   (b)    Control of Storm Water Flow Rate: The flow rate of storm water from a
developed site must be controlled in order to meet the following criteria:
      (1)    The peak flow of storm water from the developed site at an
appropriately selected point of analysis shall not exceed the peak flow of
storm water from the pre-developed site at the same point of analysis for the
same year frequency storm. This requirement applies for all storms with a
frequency of one hundred (100) years and less.
      (2)    The peak flow of storm water from the site during construction at
an appropriately selected point of analysis shall not exceed the peak flow of
storm water from the pre-developed site and the same point of analysis for the
same year frequency storm. This requirement applies for all storms with a
frequency of ten (10) years and less.
      (3)    The flow of storm water from the developed site shall be drained
to an adequate outlet. This outlet must be approved by the City of Dover and
will consist of a channel, stream, river, storm sewer, pond or lake having
sufficient capacity to accommodate flow from the developed site.
      (4)    The flow of storm water from the developed site must not cause
flooding to proposed buildings within the development or to existing downstream
homes, buildings, places of business or other structures.
      (5)    Surface water draining from an existing watershed area cannot be
diverted, channeled, piped or otherwise rerouted into another watershed area
unless approved by the City of Dover.
   (c)    Storm Water Control Structures and Methods. Control of storm water
runoff from a developed site may be accomplished using a control structure such
as a storm water management basin, underground storage tanks or pipes, storage
on pavement areas, storage on roof areas or a combination of these types of
control measures. The primary purpose of any storm water runoff control
structure is to temporarily store water during a storm and release it at a rate
that meets the criteria given previously.
      (1)    The two (2) methods that are permitted for use to determine the
peak flow rate of storm water from a site as well as for determining the
required storage volume of a runoff control structure are the Modified Rational
Method and the Soil Conservation Service Methods.
      (2)    Precipitation frequency for the developed site shall be determined
from the twenty-four (24) hour precipitation duration data published by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service for
Dover, Ohio.
      (3)    Drainage drawings for both the pre-developed and post-developed
sites shall be provided. These drawings shall be to a scale that allows the
following information to be neatly presented and clearly read:
         A.    Existing and proposed elevation contours shall be shown with the
contour interval not exceeding a two (2) foot interval for slopes greater than
ten percent (10%), and with the contour interval not exceeding a one (1) foot
interval for slopes less than ten percent (10%). This requirement may be
modified, if drawing clarity demands such.
         B.    Indicate the discharge location or locations on the drawings to
which the pre-developed and post-developed storm waters flow. Also, indicate
the location of the hydraulically most distant point or points from which storm
waters originate.
         C.    Delineate in detail the contours and shapes of all storm water
holding basins and their control structures and devices at a scale which lends
clarity to their construction and installation.
      (4)    Storm water runoff control structures shall be constructed of
reinforced concrete at locations where they can be readily maintained. Flows
shall be regulated utilizing fixed weirs. Control structures shall also have
overflow openings. Discharges from control structures into streams or other
non-piped or rigid outlets shall have the discharge area protected with large
aggregate riprap.
      (5)    All storm water holding basins shall have emergency overflows
incorporated into their design in case the runoff control structures become
blocked or their capacity is exceeded. The emergency overflow spillway shall be
designed such that the flow of storm water from the developed site does not
cause flooding to building or structures within the development or to
downstream buildings or structures.
      (6)    The City of Dover reserves the right to select the type or types
of storm water runoff control methods and structures that are to be designed
for a definitive site. Only detention, retention or infiltration basins are
acceptable runoff control structures for new residential subdivisions or other
types of residential complexes, new large commercial developments, or new large
industrial developments.
   (d)    Water Quality Volume: For large construction activities that are
disturbing two (2) acres or more of soils, or that are part of a total common
plan of development which will collectively disturb two (2) acres or more of
soils, the post construction facilities must be sized to treat a volume of
storm water (known as WQv) equal to the volume of storm water runoff from a
nine-tenth (.90) of an inch rainfall over the developed site.
   The water quality volume (WQv) shall be determined using the following
equations:
   WQv = ((Rv) (P) (A))/12            (Equation 1)
   
   where,
   WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
   Rv = the volumetric runoff coefficient calculated using equation 2
   P = 0.90 inch precipitation depth
   A = acres draining into BMP in acres
   Rv = 0.05 + 0.9i               (Equation 2)
   
   where i = fraction of post construction impervious surface
   An additional volume of storm water runoff equal to twenty percent (20%) of
the WQv shall be incorporated into the post construction facility for sediment
storage and outlet control.
      (1)    The Storm water quantity volume (the volume of water stored to
control the storm water runoff flow rate) must be stacked on top of the storm
water quality volume for any storm water facility that will also serve as the
post-construction storm water facility. In other words, use the top of the WQv
as the base elevation for the storm water runoff control volume.
      (2)    The initial settling pool or forebay volume for sediment storage
shall be equal to one half of the additional twenty percent (20%) volume
required for sediment storage. To accommodate relatively frequent sediment
cleanout, easy equipment access should be provided to the forebay.
      (3)    The other half of the additional twenty percent (20%) volume
required for sediment storage shall be a micropool that filters and controls
the rate of flow of the WQv. The flow control orifice cannot be less than two
and one-half (2) inches in diameter and shall be designed to be non-clogging.
   (e)    Detention Basins:
      (1)    Detention basins shall provide the control of storm water flow
rates and the water quality volume (water quality volume when applicable)
prescribed in the preceding subsections (b) and (d). The construction of the
basins shall conform to the design requirements required herein and those
presented in the current edition of the previously referenced Ohio's "Rainwater
and Land Development" manual.
      (2)    For safety considerations, the interior slopes of a detention
basin shall not exceed a 4: 1 slope unless the perimeter of the basin is fenced
with at least one gate large enough to allow maintenance equipment, such as
trucks and backhoes, to enter into the basin for maintenance purposes. Large
basins shall have additional gates for maintenance as required and approved by
the City of Dover.
      (3)    An emergency spillway shall be provided as heretofore stated. The
bottom elevation of the spillway shall be above the water elevation in the
basin for the design runoff from all storms with a frequency of one hundred
(100) years or less, and the required water quality volume.
      (4)    For basins that are to be dedicated to the City of Dover as part
of its storm sewer system, the minimum top width of the side embankments shall
be six (6) feet for non-vehicular traffic. Access easements from public streets
or other public easements to the basins for vehicular maintenance equipment
shall be a minimum of fourteen (14) feet in width and be dedicated to the City
with the basin. The top width of side embankments for private basins not being
dedicated to the City of Dover may vary from the preceding stated requirements;
however, such widths shall be adequate enough, as determined by the City, for
the basins to be properly maintained. All basins dedicated to the City for
maintenance shall have their perimeter adequately fenced with six (6) feet high
aluminized chain link fence and gates, arranged as per the maintenance needs of
the City.
   (f)    Retention Basins:
      (1)    Retention basins shall conform to all of the construction and
maintenance requirements stated for detention basins in addition to the
following requirements.
         A.    Provisions shall be installed to prevent the water in the
retention basin from becoming stagnant through the use of a properly designed
aeration system.
         B.    Provisions for draining the retention basin for maintenance
shall be an integral part of the basin design, and such shall be described on
the submitted approval drawings for the basis.
   
   (g)    Underground Infiltration Basin, Dry Well or Infiltration Trench:
      (1)    Control of stormwater runoff can be achieved with the use of an
underground infiltration basin, dry well or infiltration trench when such
facilities are constructed in glacial soils and the use of such is approved by
the City of Dover. Glacial soils in which these facilities are constructed
shall have infiltration rates greater than 0.30 of an inch per hour. Buried
underground infiltration basins shall be designed in accordance with the
manufacturer's design requirements for its basins.
         A.    Infiltration rates used in the design of underground
infiltration basins, dry wells and infiltration trenches shall be determined by
soil tests conducted by a firm or individual who are normally engaged in
providing soil testing. The results of such tests shall be certified in
writing.
         B.    Only buried infiltration basins or structures shall be
permitted. Open basins, open wells or open trenches will not be permitted.
   (h)    Pavement Storage:
      (1)    Storm water runoff control can be achieved by temporarily ponding
water in parking areas. The maximum depth of water at its deepest point shall
not exceed eight (8) inches, and in no case shall be greater than the finished
floor elevation of any adjacent building.
         A.    The minimum slope of a parking lot surface shall be one percent
(1%) and the maximum slope shall be ten percent (10%).
         B.    Outlet control structures shall be designed using the design
criteria presented in subsection (b) hereof.
         C.    Provisions to prevent flooding of any adjacent building shall be
made for the cases when the outlet control structure becomes clogged or with
storms exceed the one hundred (100) year frequency.
   (i)    Roof Top Storage: Storage of storm water runoff can also be provided
by temporarily ponding water on flat roofs with parapets that contain water.
The building structural system shall be designed to accommodate the amount of
water that is being stored and meet all of the structural requirements of the
Ohio Building Code.
      (1)    Roofs shall have a minimum slope of twenty-five hundredths (0.25)
of a percent.
      (2)    Outlet and overflow control drains shall be designed using the
design criteria presented in subsection (b) hereof.
   (j)    For small construction activities, construction activities authorized
under this permit which result in a disturbance of less than two (2) acres, a
post-construction practice shall be used to treat storm water runoff for
pollutants and reduce adverse impacts on receiving waters as per the most
recent edition of Ohio EPA General Permit Authorization for Storm Water
Discharges Associated with Construction Activity, Provisions of this permit
which require approval from the regulated MS4 will be adhered to. As such, the
use of non-standard BMP' s that are required because of a site’s physical
constraints will be authorized by the City of Dover on a case by case basis.
   (k)    For redevelopment of previously developed areas, a reduction of the
water quality requirement is permissible as outlined in the most recent edition
of Ohio EPA General Permit Authorization for Storm Water Discharges Associated
with Construction Activity, provided the conditions outlined in the permit are
achieved.
   (l)   Maintenance Plans: Detail drawings and maintenance plans shall be
provided for all post-construction BMPs in the SWPPP. Maintenance plans shall
be provided by the permittee to the post-construction operator of the site
(including home owner associations) upon completion of construction activities
(prior to termination of permit coverage). Maintenance plans shall insure that
pollutants collected within structural post-construction practices are disposed
of in accordance with local, state and federal regulations. To ensure that
storm water management systems function be designed and constructed, the post-
construction operation and maintenance plan shall be a standalone document
which contains the following information:
      (1)    There shall be a designated entity for storm water inspection and
maintenance responsibilities.
      (2)    The plan shall include the routine and non-routine maintenance
tasks to be undertaken.
      (3)    There shall be a schedule for inspection and maintenance.
      (4)    The plan shall include any necessary legally binding maintenance
easements and agreements.
      (5)    The construction drawings or excerpts showing the plan view,
profile and details of the outlet(s) shall be included.
      (6)    There shall be a map showing all access, and maintenance
easements.
      (7)    The plan shall provide relevant elevations and associated volumes
that dictate when removal of accumulated sediments must occur.
   Plans shall address future changes in ownership to ensure that long-term
operations and maintenance criteria continue to be met.
   (m)    Any desired modifications to post-construction water runoff controls
that occur after the initial SWPPP approval must be approved the City of Dover.

   (a)    When portions of a site are sold permit coverage must be continued on
lots and or parcels until they meet the criteria for final stabilization and a
Notice of Termination (NOT) is submitted to the Ohio EPA. For developments
which require the use of centralized sediment and erosion controls (that
address runoff from one (1) or more lots) and where the transfer of permit
coverage will prevent or impair the implementation of controls, the original
permittee must maintain responsibility for their implementation. Where this is
not the case, the original permittee must temporarily stabilize sold lots,
inform the new lot owner of his permit obligations, and ensure that an
Individual Lot NOI application is submitted to the Ohio EPA at least seven (7)
days prior to the date the new lot owner intends to accept permit
responsibility. Transfer of permit coverage is not granted until the applicant
receives an approval letter from Ohio EPA. The original permittee may submit an
Individual Lot NOT at the time the Individual Lot NOI is submitted.
   (b)    When the new lot owner becomes a co-permittee with the original
permittee, or has permit coverage transferred to become the sole permittee, the
lot owner should obtain a copy of the original SWPPP and comply with its
requirements. Depending on site topography and location, additional controls
above and beyond those outlined for the "typical" lot may be required. The new
lot owner may be partially or completely responsible for amending the SWPPP and
installing those controls.
(Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-21.)
   1114.12 NOTICE OF TERMINATION (NOT).
   (a)    Permittees wishing to terminate permit coverage must submit a NOT to
the Ohio EPA. A NOT form must be submitted within forty-five (45) days of
completing all permitted land disturbance activities and when one or more of
the following conditions have been met:
      (1)    Final stabilization has been achieved on all portions of the site
for which the permittee is responsible;
      (2)    Another operator(s) has assumed control over all areas of the site
that have not been finally stabilized;
      (3)    For residential construction only, temporary stabilization has
been completed and the lot, which includes a home, has been transferred to the
homeowner. (Lots without housing which are sold must undergo final
stabilization prior to termination of permit coverage.)
   (b)    Before submitting a NOT, final stabilization must be achieved. This
means that:
      (1)    All soil disturbing activities are complete and a uniform
perennial vegetative cover of a least seventy percent (70%) density (across the
entire site) has been established. All temporary erosion and sediment controls
have been removed and properly disposed, and all trapped sediment has been
permanently stabilized; or
      (2)    For individual lots in residential construction, either
         A.    The homebuilder has competed final stabilization as specified
above or
         B.    The homebuilder has established temporary stabilization,
including perimeter controls for the lot, prior to the homeowner occupying the
house, and the homebuilder has informed the homeowner that the homeowner is
required to complete the final stabilization.
            (Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-21.)
   1114.13 MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)    Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program: The City shall establish a program to detect and eliminate
illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This Program shall
include the mapping of the MS4 (including MS4 outfalls and home sewage
treatment systems); the routine inspection of storm water outfalls to the MS4,
and the systematic investigation of potential residential, commercial,
industrial and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry-weather
flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)    Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)    The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to this Chapter as often as may be necessary, at reasonable times and
upon reasonable notice to the Owner/Operator, to determine compliance with this
Chapter. This right of entry shall be subject to constitutional restrictions on
unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is refused or not obtained, the
City is authorized to pursue recourse as provided by law including, but not
limited to, seeking an administrative search warrant, injunctive relief and/or
criminal remedies.
      (2)    The City shall have the right to set up at facilities subject to
this Chapter such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's storm water discharge, as determined by the City.
      (3)    The City shall have the right to require the facility's Owner/
Operator to install sampling and/or monitoring equipment as the City deems
necessary. This sampling and/or monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in safe and proper operating condition by the Owner/Operator at the
Owner/Operator's expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and
quality shall be calibrated by the City to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or monitored shall be promptly
removed by the facility's Owner/Operator at the written or oral request of the
City and shall not be replaced. The cost of clearing such access shall be borne
by the facility Owner/Operator.
      (5)    Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a facility
subject to this Chapter for the purposes of illicit discharge inspection may be
a violation of this Chapter.
      (6)    Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility Owner/Operator. If such costs are not paid within thirty (30) days
of the date of the invoice sent to the Owner/Operator, the City may cause a
lien to be placed upon the property of the facility.
         (Ord. 48-21. Passed 12-6-21.)
   1114.14 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (a)    Notice of Violation and Correction Order.
      (1)    When the City finds that a premise is in violation of any
provision of this Chapter, or that an Owner/Operator has violated any provision
of this Chapter or has failed to meet any requirement of this Chapter, the City

      (2)    If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected
property is required, the Correction Order shall set forth a deadline within
which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Order shall
further advise that should the Owner/Operator fail to remediate and/or restore
within the established deadline, legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
      (3)    Any Owner/Operator receiving Notice of Violation and/or Correction
Order must meet compliance standards within the time established in the Notice
of Violation and/or Correction Order.
   (b)    Appeals: Any Owner/Operator who is adversely affected by the issuance
of a Notice of Violation and/or Correction Order under this Chapter may appeal

   1117.01 HARDSHIP EXCEPTION.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape, or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations would result
in real difficulties, substantial hardship or injustice, the City Planning
Commission may vary or modify these Subdivision Regulations so that the
subdivider may subdivide his property in a reasonable manner; but, at the same
time, the public welfare and interest of the City and the surrounding areas
must be thoroughly protected and the general intent and spirit of these
Subdivision Regulations enforced.

   1117.02 LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT.
   The standards and requirements of these Subdivision Regulations may be
modified by the Planning Commission in the case of a plan or program for a new
town, a complete community or a neighborhood unit, which in the judgment of the
Planning Commission provides adequate public space and improvements for the
circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully
developed and populated, and which also provides such covenants or other legal
provisions as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan. (Ord. 45-
67. Passed 8-7-67.)

INTRODUCTION
   The information and material included in the following pages has been
developed to provide the potential land developer, as well as local
governmental administrators, with sources of procedural and exemplary tools to
assist in the administration of the community's subdivision regulations as well
as to promote a better and more satisfactory design for new development.
   The subdivision procedure flow diagram which follows illustrates the steps
which a subdivider must take to receive final plat approval under the
subdivision regulations. In following the prescribed procedure, the subdivider
must submit a series of three plats or plans. These are (1) a preliminary
subdivision plan, (2) a preliminary plat, and (3) a final plat or series of
final plats to be filed with the County Recorder.

DESIGN CONCEPTS
   As a result primarily of the post World War II building boom, many new
concepts, means, methods, and materials have developed to provide for the
construction of better subdivisions, commercial centers, industrial complexes,
neighborhoods, and even communities. The concept of grid system street design,
as an example, today is considered completely obsolete. The concept of
individual properties is rapidly becoming obsolete as a new cluster-type design
is developing wherein common, jointly maintained open space flows throughout
the neighborhood between individual building sites. To assist the local
developer and the community's administrators in arriving at suitable
developmental design decisions, several development examples are included in
the following pages. They illustrate not only concepts of subdivision design
but also local business center development, industrial development, and mobile
home park development.

   1141.04 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Any lawful use of any dwelling, building, structure or land existing
at the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued, even though
such use does not conform to the provisions thereof.
 
   (b)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (c), below, whenever the use
of a building or land shall become nonconforming through a change in this
Zoning Ordinance or a change in the district boundaries, such use may be
continued, and may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a
more restricted classification.
 
   (c)   A nonconforming use of a building or land, or portions thereof, which
are hereafter voluntarily discontinued for a continuous period of two years or
more, shall not again be used except as in conformity with the regulations of
the district in which such building or land is located.
 
   (d)   Any building arranged, intended or designed for a nonconforming use,
the construction of which has been started at the time of the passage of this
Zoning Ordinance, but not completed as of the date of passage hereof, may be
completed and put into such nonconforming use, provided it is done within one
year after the effective date of the within Zoning Ordinance.
 
   (e)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, no nonconforming
building or structure shall be moved, extended, enlarged or altered, and no
nonconforming use of land shall be expanded, except when authorized by the
Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (1)   The Board may permit the extension of a use or building into a more
restricted district immediately adjacent thereto, but not more than twenty-five
feet beyond the dividing line of the two districts, under such conditions as
will safeguard development in the more restricted district.
      (2)   In any event the Board shall permit the movement, extension or
expansion of a nonconforming use to any applicant who demonstrates that a
failure to obtain permission to use the property in the nonconforming manner
will remove all economic viability from the property at issue
      (3)   In any event the Board shall permit the movement, extension or
expansion of a nonconforming structure to any applicant who demonstrates that
failure to obtain permission to move, extend or expand the structure will
result in practical difficulties for the landowner.
 
   (f)   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or a more
restricted classification without prior authorization by the Board. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming
use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use. The
nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those parts thereof
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 13-05. Passed 3-21-05.)
 
   (g)   Structural alterations to existing, nonconforming single family or
duplex residence dwellings may be made without the prior approval of the Board
in any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   If the improvement is being made to more nearly conform with other
dwellings in the district; or
      (2)   If structural alterations are being made in order to comply with or
improve sanitary, health and safety conditions or requirements on any such
dwelling. In such case, said alteration or additions may not project beyond the
sideline or wall of the existing dwelling, and in no instance come closer than
three feet to any side lot line or ten feet from any rear lot line. The
addition or structural alteration shall not increase the total floor area of
said single family dwelling by more than fifty square feet.
 
   (h)   The Board may permit the temporary use of a structure or premises in
any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations
prescribed elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is
located, provided that such use is of a temporary nature and does not involve
the erection of a substantial structure. A Zoning Certificate for such use
shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit, pursuant to
the terms of Chapter
1125, for not more than a twelve month period, subject to such conditions as
will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
 
   (i)   A nonconforming building which has been damaged by fire, explosion,
act of God or the public enemy, may be repaired or reconstructed and used as
before the time of the damage, provided such repairs or reconstruction are
commenced within one year of the date of such damage.
 
   (j)   Nonconforming trailers or mobile homes located on a lot in any
district other than an “R-3" district, once removed, shall not be relocated on
such lot.
(Ord. 13-05. Passed 3-21-05; Ord. 60-08. Passed 1-5-09.)
   1141.05 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide in
accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, applications, filed as
provided in Chapter
1125, for Conditional Uses. In considering an application for conditional use,
the Board shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent
uses and structures. In authorizing a conditional use, the Board may impose
such requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction,
maintenance and operation, in addition to those considerations expressly
stipulated in the Dover City Zoning Ordinance for the particular conditional
use or special exception as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of
adjacent properties and the public interest.
   (b)   In determining whether to grant a request for a conditional use for
property within any Residential or Special district as provided for in Section
1141.02, the Board shall consider effect that the proposed use would have on
the health, safety and welfare of the City of Dover and its residents,
including, but not limited to the following factors:
      (1)   The effect that the location and size of the proposed use, and the
nature and intensity of the operations involved or conducted in connection with
the proposed use, will have on the general character of the existing
neighborhood;
      (2)   The effect that the location, size, nature and intensity of the
operations contemplated by the proposed use will have upon pedestrian and
vehicular traffic in the immediate and surrounding neighborhood;
      (3)   Whether the location, physical properties, and nature of the
proposed use are such so as to interfere with the use and development of
adjacent land or buildings, or impair the value thereof.
   (c)   In determining whether to grant a request for conditional use for
property within any Business or Industrial district as provided for in Section
1141.02, the Board shall consider effect that the proposed use would have on
the health, safety and welfare of the City of Dover, including, but not limited
to the following factors:
      (1)   The effect that the location, size, nature and intensity of the
operations contemplated by the proposed use will have upon pedestrian and
vehicular traffic in the immediate and surrounding neighborhood;
      (2)   Whether the nature, location, size and site layout of the proposed
use directly conflicts with the general character of the commercial or
industrial district in which it is situated;
      (3)   Whether the location, physical properties and nature of the
proposed use are such so as to interfere with the use and development of
adjacent land or buildings or impair the value thereof; and
      (4)   Whether the location, physical properties, and nature of the
proposed use are such so as to subject nearby residential dwellings to
hazardous or dangerous materials, fumes, or other byproducts of the proposed
use.
   (d)   The Board shall award a conditional use permit to any applicant who
demonstrates that failure to obtain permission to use the property in the
conditional manner proposed will result in the removal of all economic
viability of the property.
   (e)   When an application is filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals for a
conditional use permitting a mobile home park in an area zoned “R-3", the Board
will recommend whether to grant said application to the Dover City Council.
Said recommendation shall be considered by City Council in determining whether
to grant a conditional use permit for such purpose. No request for a
conditional use permit for the use of property as a mobile home park shall be
granted unless formally approved by Dover City Council. A request for a
conditional use permitting a mobile home park in an “R-3" zone shall be
considered denied if not acted on by Council within ninety days following the
issuance of the recommendation provided for herein.
(Ord. 13-05. Passed 3-21-05.)
   1141.06 VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific
cases, filed as provided in the Dover City Zoning Ordinances, such variances
from the provisions or requirements of said Zoning Ordinances as will not be
contrary to the public interest so that the spirit of said Zoning Ordinances
shall be observed and substantial justice shall be done. In granting a
variance, the Board may impose such conditions as it may deem necessary to
protect the public health, safety and well being, and in furtherance of the
purposes and intent of said Zoning Ordinances.
   (b)   When determining whether or not to award a variance from the
requirements of the Dover City Zoning Ordinances, the Board shall consider the
following factors:
      (1)   Whether the existing Dover City Zoning Ordinances create a
situation in which the applicant is unable to yield a reasonable return or
enjoy any beneficial use of the property without the variance requested;
      (2)   Whether the variance requested requires a significant departure
from the City of Dover Zoning Ordinances;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood where the
variance is sought, will be substantially altered if said variance is granted;
      (4)   Whether the owners of land adjoining the property for which the
variance is sought will be suffer a substantial detriment;
      (5)   Whether the award of the variance sought would adversely affect the
delivery of governmental services, including, but not limited to, the provision
of water, sewer, garbage collection or fire protection;
      (6)   Whether the applicant’s predicament giving rise to the request for
a variance can be feasible obviated through a method other than the issuance of
a variance;
      (7)   Whether the applicant for the variance purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restriction that gave rise to the request for the
variance; and
      (8)   Whether the spirit and intent of the zoning restriction giving rise
to the request for the variance will be substantially preserved if the variance
requested is granted.
   (c)   With due consideration of the totality of the circumstances, including
the factors listed in subsection (b) above, the Board shall grant an
application for a variance to the area requirements and restrictions of the
Dover City Zoning Ordinances, only if the applicant demonstrates that such area
requirements and restrictions impose a practical difficulty upon the applicant.
For purposes of the within provision, the term “area requirements and
restrictions”, shall include, but not be limited to, provisions set forth in
the Dover City Zoning Ordinances relating to setback, height, frontage,
percentage of lot coverage, minimum lot area, minimum floor area, and yard
requirements and restrictions.
   (d)   With due consideration of the totality of the circumstances, including
the factors listed in subsection (b) above, the Board shall grant an
application for a variance to the use requirements and restrictions of the
Dover City Zoning Ordinances, only if the applicant demonstrates that a failure
to obtain the variance requested will remove all economic viability of the
property. For purposes of the within provision, the term, “use requirements and
restrictions”, shall include, but not be limited to, the provisions set
delineated in Sections
1141.02 and
1141.03 relating to the particular manner that property may be put to use. The
application for a conditional use shall not be considered a request for a use
variance, but shall be determined pursuant to the terms set forth in Section
1141.05.
   (e)   No request for a variance shall be granted unless the Board determines
that the condition or situation applicable to the affected property, and/or the
intended use thereof, is not so general or recurrent in nature as to make
reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
condition, situation or use.
(Ord. 13-05. Passed 3-21-05.)
   (f)   Lapse of Variances.
      (1)   A variance, once granted, shall not be withdrawn or changed unless
there is a change of circumstances, or if, after the expiration of one year, no
substantial construction is done in accordance with the terms and conditions
for which such variance was granted. If the person who received the variance or
the subsequent owner of the land have not completed substantial construction
within that one year, the variance shall expire and the land reverts to its
prior zoning and use restriction under the Dover Codified Ordinances; unless,
the person or subsequent owner of the land requests within the initial twelve
months or the second twelve month extension, a twelve month extension of the
variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals. The extension may be granted without
a hearing. One additional twelve- month extension (for a maximum of two twelve
month extensions) may be granted. After the expiration of three years from the
grant of the variance, and only if the person or subsequent owner appropriately
requested the extensions, noted herein, the variance shall lapse and any rights
to deviate from the zoning and use restrictions of the Dover Codified
Ordinances granted by the variance shall terminate and expire.
      (2)   Whenever the Board of Zoning Appeals grants a variance, it is
granted subject to the time restrictions stated in this subsection and a copy
of this subsection shall be deemed part of any variance so granted. A copy of
this subsection shall be provided to the applicant at the time the variance is
granted. (Ord. 67-09. Passed 1-4-10.)

   1149.02 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of the
use or occupation of all Rights-Of-Way in the City, the issuance of Right-Of-
Way Permits to persons for such use or occupancy, and to set forth the policies
of the City related thereto.
   (b)   A Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit issued pursuant to this chapter does
not take the place of any franchise, license, or permit which may be
additionally required by law, including any required by City ordinance. A
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit issued pursuant to this chapter also does not
grant pole attachment rights or preclude the need to enter into a public and/or
private pole attachment agreements. Each Permittee shall obtain any and all
such additional state, federal or City franchises, licenses or permits
necessary to the operation and conduct of its business or the occupation or use
of any Right-Of-Way; provided, however, that no Permittee holding a valid
Right-Of-Way Permit shall be required to obtain a franchise for any type of
services rendered by said Permittee for which the City did not require a
franchise at the time said Permittee's permit was last issued or renewed.
Should there be a direct conflict between the provisions of this chapter and a
valid franchise, the provisions of the franchise shall prevail; provided,
however, that additional obligations shall not be construed as a conflict.
   (c)   The Mayor, or designee, is hereby directed and empowered to enforce
the provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   The City's policy regarding Rights-Of-Way is:
      (1)   To promote the utilization of Rights-Of-Way for the public health,
safety and welfare and to promote economic development in the City;
      (2)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
telecommunication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technologies and innovative services to the City's residents and taxpayers at
reasonable costs;
      (3)   To promote cooperation among the Permittees and the City in the
occupation of Rights-Of-Way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during Right-Of-Way work, and eliminate wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly duplication of Facilities;
      (4)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (5)   To ensure adequate public reimbursement of costs the City has
incurred for private use of the Rights-Of-Way, including the regulation
thereof;
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
Rights-Of-Way, and when all requests for Right-Of-Way use cannot be
accomplished, to give priority for use of Rights-Of-Way, in the order
indicated, from highest to lowest, to the following users:    
         A.   The City for governmental purposes;
         B.   Another governmental entity for governmental purposes with the
City's concurrence, or other governmental use required by law;

seq., and is recognized on the rolls of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
as a regulated utility or of a Cable Operator possessing a valid franchise
awarded pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, for the
services to be provided by the Facilities subject to this chapter shall be
presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial
resources.
      (8)   To ensure that access to and occupancy or use of the public Right-
Of-Way advances the state of Ohio policies specified in sections 4927.02,
4928.02, and 4929.02 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (9)   To expedite the installation and operation of Micro and smaller
Wireless Facilities in order to facilitate the deployment of advanced Wireless
Service throughout the state of Ohio.
   (e)   All Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permits granted hereunder shall be non-
exclusive and no property right of any nature shall be created by the granting
of a permit under this chapter.
   (f)   This chapter does not apply, and nothing herein should be construed to
apply the provisions of this Chapter, to structures or Facilities owned or
operated by the City or any City operations that occupy or use the Rights-Of-
Way. It is specifically contemplated, however, that all City departments or
divisions that utilize the Rights-Of-Way shall carry out their operations in a

pursuant to Chapter
1149. Any Person owning, operating or maintaining structures or Facilities in
the Right-Of-Way without a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit, including Persons

Rights-Of-Way generally for business purposes, including the provision of
utility, cable television, telecommunications or other services to the City,

telecommunications or other utility services for which the City may lawfully
require a franchise, to acquire a franchise upon the expiration of any Right-
Of-Way Occupancy Permit issued hereunder.
   
   (d)   Any such Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit may also allow the use of
specified public property for the uses set forth in the Right-Of-Way Occupancy
Permit and in this chapter.
   (e)   Each Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit shall specify the use or uses for
which it is granted and contain such other non-discriminatory terms and
conditions as are appropriate and as are set forth in the regulations.
   (f)   Unless otherwise set forth herein, Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permits or
the rights of a Permittee thereunder are not transferable without the prior
express written approval of the Mayor, upon written request. Such request shall
contain evidence that the proposed transferee has the financial, technical and
managerial resources to comply with the obligations of this chapter and its
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit and shall be granted if such transferee has such
resources. In making said determination, a proposed transferee shall be
presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial resources
if said transferee possesses a valid certification from the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, including certification pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4933.81, et
seq., and is recognized on the rolls of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio

Occupancy Permits that shall include provisions providing that (i) all requests
for transfer shall be deemed approved if the Mayor does not disapprove the same
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the completed written transfer request;
and (ii) transfer to affiliates under common ownership and control with the
Permittee shall not require approval, so long as the Mayor is provided thirty
(30) days written notice of such transfer.
   (g)   Any Facilities or part of a Facility found in a Right-Of-Way for which
a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a
nuisance and an unauthorized use of the Right-Of-Way. The City may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to
abating the nuisance; taking possession of the Facilities and/or non-complying
portion of such Facility; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (h)   The Mayor shall adopt regulations controlling and further defining
residential purposes and to otherwise implement the determinations to be made
under this section. Such regulations shall, among other matters, specify: (i)
that the owner of Facilities that hold title to such Facilities solely as a
result of a leaseback, defined as the sale or transfer of property by a
Permittee to another person contemporaneously followed by the leasing of the
property to the Permittee on a long-term basis; and (ii) are operated or
controlled by the Permittee, are not considered to be using, occupying, owing
or operating such Facilities, for purposes of this chapter, solely as a result
of such leaseback.

(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.05 CRITERIA FOR GRANTING PERMITS.
   (a)   A General Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit shall be granted to an
Applicant upon a determination that:
      (1)   The granting of the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit will contribute
to the public health, safety or welfare in the City;
      (2)   The granting of the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit will be
consistent with the policy of the City as set forth in Section
1149.02(d);
      (3)   The Applicant is not delinquent on any Right-Of-Way permit fees, or
costs owed the City for Right-Of-Way related activity and, except in the case
of entities subject to the jurisdiction and recognized on the rolls of the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio as a regulated utility or of a Cable
Operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, has the
requisite financial, managerial and technical ability to fulfill all its
obligations hereunder;
      (4)   The Applicant's Right-of-Way Occupancy Permit would not be granted
for placement of a Small Cell Facility or Wireless Support Structure
aboveground, in an area that has been designated solely for undergrounding;
and,
      (5)   The Applicant of the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit is in compliance
with the City's written design guidelines to match the aesthetics and character
of the immediate area including other ground-mounted Small Cell Facilities, the
location of Small Cell Facilities on Wireless Support Structures, appearance
and concealment measures, meets the design or concealment measures required for
a Historic District, and the design and appearance of the Wireless Support
Structure including height requirements.
   (b)   A Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit shall not convey equitable or legal
title in the Right-Of-Way. A Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit is only the
nonexclusive, limited right to occupy Right-Of-Way in the City, for the limited
purposes and for the limited period stated in the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit
and in accordance with Chapter
1149 of the Code. The rights to occupy the Right of Way may not be subdivided
or subleased; provided, however, that two or more Permittees may collocate
Facilities in the same area of the Right-Of-Way so long as each such Person
complies with the provisions of Chapter
1149. Collocating Permittees may file a joint application for a Construction
Permit. A Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit does not excuse a Permittee from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating
its Facilities on Facilities of others, including the City's Facilities. A
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit does not excuse a Permittee from complying with
any provisions of the Code or other applicable Law.
   (c)   The Mayor, or his designee, may impose such lawful conditions on the
granting of a permit as reasonably required to be consistent with the criteria
set forth in this section and to promote the policy of the City set forth in
Section
1149.02(d).

by Chapter
1149 and this Chapter and as may be more specifically set forth in regulations
promulgated pursuant to this chapter, and provided further, that mandatory
joint planning shall not require the exchange or provision of trade secrets or

only to the extent the same is consistent with the grant thereof, is not
additionally burdensome to any property owner or unreasonably burdensome to the
Permittee;
      (5)   Upon reasonable written notice of not less than sixty (60) days,
except in an emergency threatening the public health, safety or welfare, and at
the direction of the Mayor, or his designee, and at the Permittee's sole cost,
to the extent permitted by Ohio law, promptly remove or rearrange Facilities as
necessary, as further specified in the regulations: (i) during any
construction, repair or modification of any street, sidewalk, city utility or
other public improvement; (ii) as part of the Mayor, or his designee's
determination, to the extent permitted by Ohio law, that designated portions of
its Rights-Of-Way should accommodate only underground Facilities or that
Facilities should occupy only one side of a street or other public way,
provided that such determination is reasonable and a part of an overall
improvement plan or project; (iii) if an additional or subsequent City or other
public use of Rights-Of-Way is inconsistent with the then-current uses of such
Permittee; or (iv) for any other reasonable cause as determined by the Mayor,
or his designee, pursuant to Section
1149.14(b) to the extent permitted by Ohio law; however, nothing in this
division shall be interpreted as foreclosing any rights that any Permittee has
pursuant to Ohio R.C. Title 49 to file an application with the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio under any applicable provision of R.C. Title 49, in order to
recover the costs associated with the relocation of any Facilities pursuant to
this division;
      (6)   Provide information relating to a Permittee's Facilities and
operations within the Rights- Of-Way in such form as to allow for the accurate
assessment of the quantity of a utility's infrastructure in the public Rights-
Of-Way; for a Right-Of-Way work permit, Permittee shall provide a detailed
plan, as delineated in Chapter
1149, of the proposed work. Upon a proper request by a Permittee demonstrating
that any portion of the information required constitutes a "trade secret"
pursuant to Ohio law, or that the material should remain confidential pursuant
to any other provision of local, state, or federal law, the material shall be
treated as confidential and not subject to public disclosure. In no event will
the City allow any person involved with the City's telecommunications service
access to information a Permittee has designated "confidential" or
"proprietary";
      (7)   Perform all work, construction, maintenance or removal of
structures and Facilities within the Rights-Of-Way, including tree trimming, in
accordance with good engineering and construction practice including any
appropriate safety codes and in accordance with the regulations and use its
best efforts to repair and replace any street, curb or other portion of the
Rights-Of-Way within the disturbed area of the work area, or Facilities or
structure located therein, to a condition to be determined by the Mayor to be
adequate under current standards, on file with the City Engineer, and not less
than materially equivalent to its condition prior to such work and to do so in
a manner which minimizes any inconvenience to the public, the City and other
Permittees, all in accordance with the regulations adopted hereunder or under
Chapter
1149. Each occupant of the Right-Of-Way that may make a street cut shall file
with the City standards for repair of street cuts that shall be approved or
denied by the City Engineer within sixty (60) days after filing. If the street
cut standards are denied the Right-Of-Way, the occupant must amend its proposed
standards to meet the City's requirements prior to making any street cuts. Each
Right-Of-Way Applicant shall amend its street cut standards from time to time
as required by good engineering practice. If a street cut repair fails, the
Right-Of-Way occupant responsible for the street cut shall repair the street
cut until such time as the City repaves the streets. No Right-Of-Way occupant
shall be responsible to repair a street cut damaged by a cause other than the
repair made by the Right-Of-Way occupant;
      (8)   Register, or cause to be registered, its Facilities with
underground reporting services as set forth in the regulations;
      (9)   Use its best efforts to cooperate with the city in any emergencies
involving the Rights-Of-Way in such manner as the regulations shall require,
including the maintenance of a 24-hour emergency contact;
      (10)   Field identify, using distinct identification, all structures and
Facilities in areas of the Rights-Of-Way designated for construction or related
activities in accordance with the regulations, provided that the regulations
shall require that the field identifications utilize, to the greatest extent
possible, customary industry standards for such identification; and
      (11)   Designate a single point of contact for all purposes hereunder, as
well as comply with such other contact and notice protocols as the regulations
require.
   (b)   Each Permittee shall assure that any subcontractor or other person
performing any work or service in the Rights-Of-Way on behalf of said Permittee
will comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and its Right-Of-Way
Permit and will identify the Permittee for whom such contractor is working.
Said Permittee shall be responsible and liable hereunder for all actions of any
such subcontractor or others, as if said Permittee had performed or failed to
perform any such obligation. (Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.07 PERMIT FEES AND AUDITING.
   (a)   Any cable television provider that has a valid franchise to operate a
cable television system within the City shall not be liable for any additional
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit fees over and above any cable television
franchise fees specified in its cable television franchise for uses of Rights-
Of-Way directly related to the uses for which such cable television provider
holds a cable franchise, so long as the amount of such fees due in each quarter
is equal to or greater than the amounts otherwise due the City pursuant to
subsection (b) of this section. If the amount due under division (B) of this
section is more than said cable franchise fees, then the cable television
provider shall receive a credit in each quarter against such amount for all
such fees paid in such quarter and shall pay the balance to the City as set
forth in subsection (b) of this section.
      (1)   In addition to any fees charged pursuant to Chapter
1149, all General Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittees shall pay an annual fee,
for each calendar year, as compensation for the City's cost to manage,
administer and control the Right-Of-Way and maintain each general Right-Of-Way
Occupancy Permit. Every Permittee shall pay to the City General Occupancy
Right-Of-Way fees beginning January 1, 2017. Fees shall be determined and
assessed to Permittees and other persons using and occupying the Rights-Of-Way
in accordance with the following process and formula:
         A.   The City by January 31 of each year shall calculate all actual
and incurred costs associated with Rights-Of-Way management, administration and
control for the previous calendar year that the City incurred and was not able
to reasonably recover through permit fees or other recovery mechanisms for each
Permittee.
         B.   The City shall invoice each permittee based on the actual costs
incurred by the City for Right-Of-Way management for that Permittee per
subsection (a)(1)A. of this section. This shall be the Permittee's then-current
General Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit fee.
         C.   Registration fees shall be invoiced to permittees on or about
February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due thirty (30) days following
receipt.
         D.   To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing
authorities on the use of City property as a result of a Permittee's use or
occupation of the Rights-Of-Way, the Permittee shall be responsible for payment
of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable
pursuant to this chapter and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu
of the Right-Of-Way Permit fees.
      (2)   All Right-Of-Way related fees collected through this chapter and
Chapter
1149 shall be deposited in a separate fund to be utilized for the offset of
municipal costs associated with the management and control of the public Right-
Of-Way.
   (b)   All fees pursuant to this chapter shall be paid by check, money order
or wire transfer to the City of Dover, Ohio.
   (c)   Each General Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittee shall maintain books,
records, maps, documents and other evidence directly pertinent to its
calculation of payments to the City. The Mayor, or his designee, the City
Auditor or either's designated agents shall have reasonable access to any
books, records, maps, documents and other evidence for inspection, copying and
audit relative to the quantity of infrastructure in the public Right-Of-Way to
the extent necessary to assure that the payments hereunder are accurate and
that all Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittees fully comply with the provisions of
this chapter and their respective Right-Of-Way Permits. Upon a proper request
by a Permittee demonstrating that any portion of the information required
constitutes a trade secret pursuant to Ohio R.C. 133.61 through 133.69, or
shall remain confidential pursuant to any local, state, or federal law or
regulation, the material shall be treated as confidential and not subject to
public disclosure.

    1149.08 MICRO WIRELESS FACILITY.
   (a)   This section establishes terms and conditions for the use of the
public Right-Of-Way for Wireless Service Providers' Micro Wireless Facilities
through the attachment to Wireless Support Structures as established in City's
Standards or Section 4939 of the Ohio Revised Code, which is incorporated
herein by reference as if fully set forth.
   (b)   Under the provisions of this section, a Micro Wireless Facility
Operator may establish, under certain specified conditions as set forth in
City's Standards, consistent with Revised Code Chapter 4939, Wireless Service
through a Distributed Antenna System, a Small Cell Facility and related
Wireless Facilities. The City will review those requests following the criteria
and schedule set forth in Revised Code 4939.
   (c)   Additionally, the City will also review any request to attach any
Micro Wireless Facilities to a Municipal Electric Utility Pole and shall grant
such requests only if the attachment to a Municipal Electric Utility Pole
serves the public health, welfare and safety. The City shall deny all requests
to attach Micro Wireless Facilities to Municipal Electric Utility Poles if such
attachment would not serve to further the public health and welfare, would
create a safety problem, or would interfere with the conduct of any municipal
operation.
   (d)   Where not in direct conflict with Chapter 4939 of the Ohio Revised
Code, the application procedure, permit fees, and auditing procedures outlined
in this Chapter
1149 shall be applicable to applications to establish Micro Wireless
Facilities. Each individual Micro Wireless Facility will require a separate
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit.
   (e)   Any request for a ROW Occupancy Permit for a Micro Wireless Facility
will comply with the City's design guidelines as set forth in Chapter 1149 and
meet the requirements for design or concealment measures in an Historic
District.
   (f)   No Micro Wireless Facility may be placed above ground in the Right-of-
Way in the City's designated undergrounding area as described in Design
Guidelines and Requirements.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.09 JOINT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   In order to promote the purposes of this chapter and the policy set
forth herein, the Municipality shall perform an administrative review for all
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Applications including the location or installation of
new, modified or replacement poles and/or support structures and the
Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities and equipment on Poles or Support
Structures. Review factors, in addition to location, shall include the size,
shape, color, texture, and materials of the structures and attachments. Such
regulations shall not, however, require a Permittee to divulge trade secrets or
other competitively sensitive confidential information, release of which would
cause material injury to the Permittee. Such regulations shall also require any
confidential information of a Permittee in the possession of the City be
treated as such, to the extent such information does not legally constitute a
public record.
      (1)   The Municipality may require that a proposed Small Wireless
Facility or new, modified, or replacement Pole be designed to not be
significantly more readily apparent or plainly visible (to a reasonable person
of ordinary sensibilities) than existing facilities, structures, equipment, and
Poles located within five hundred (500) linear feet on the same ROW as the
subject Small Wireless Facility, Pole, or Support Structure.   
      (2)   Where Small Wireless Facilities are determined to be appropriate,
the use of reasonable stealth and concealment treatments, low-profile equipment
and control boxes, and screening may be required to avoid significant negative
impacts on the character and visual aesthetics of the area. However, such
requirements may be waived by the Municipality upon a showing that the
particular location of a Small Wireless Facility does not warrant stealth or
concealment treatments or imposes an excessive expense. The waiver shall be
granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request.
      (3)   Supplemental Review Districts identified in Exhibit A Design
Guidelines and Requirements as the Historic District - Zone 3 and Underground
District - Zone 2 may be subject to a higher level of review.
      (4)   The Municipality may maintain a Design Manual which sets forth
additional aesthetic, design, concealment, and stealth requirements applicable
to Small Wireless Facilities. The Design Manual may also, but need not, set
forth examples of Small Wireless Facility deployments that the Municipality
deems to comply with this Ordinance and provide a means for pre-approval of
designs that are suitable for a particular location, even if not strictly
compliant with the design, placement, and aesthetic requirements of this
Ordinance provided the design otherwise serves the goals of this Ordinance.
Exhibit A Design Guidelines & Requirements may be amended from time to time by
way of a duly enacted resolution.
   (b)   Maximum Size of Permitted Use.
      (1)   New Small Wireless Facilities (including any related Antenna) in
the ROW may not extend more than five (5) feet above an existing pole in place
as of the effective date of this chapter, or for Small Wireless Facilities
(including any related Antenna) on a new Pole, above the height permitted for a
new Pole pursuant to this section.
      (2)   Each new, modified, or replacement Pole installed in the ROW may
not exceed the greater of five (5) feet in height above the tallest existing
Pole in place as of the effective date of this chapter located within five
hundred (500) feet of the new, modified, or replacement Pole in the same ROW,
if a compatible pole height cannot be determined, then a maximum of forty (40)
feet above ground level shall be used.
      (3)   For Applications to place Poles in residential zoning districts to
deploy Small Wireless Facilities, the Municipality may propose an alternate
location in the ROW within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the location set
forth in the Application, and the Wireless Provider shall use the
Municipality's proposed alternate location unless the location is not
Technically Feasible or imposes significant additional costs. The Wireless
Provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in good faith,
based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in Ohio, and it shall provide a
written summary of the basis for such determination.
      (4)   Collocation is not allowed on a Decorative Pole less than twenty
(20) feet in height.
      (5)    New Poles are not permitted in a corridor where there are existing
Poles that can be used, modified, or replaced to allow the proposed
Collocation, unless the Applicant can demonstrate that:
         A.   It is not Technically Feasible to use, modify, or replace such
existing Poles; or
         B.   Such use, modification, or replacement would impose significant
additional costs on the Wireless Provider, as certified by the Wireless
Provider in good faith and based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in
Ohio along with a written summary of the basis for the certification; or
         C.   A new Pole may be placed in a manner that will cause no more
interference with the ROW and will have no more of an impact on the overall
appearance of the corridor and on adjoining properties than would the use,
modification, or replacement of an existing Pole.
   (c)   Supplemental Review Districts. Collocated Small Wireless Facilitates
and new, modified, or replacement Poles or Support Structures located in
Supplemental Review Districts shall be subject to the compliant provisions
pertaining to design and aesthetic standards in the ordinance establishing the
Supplemental Review District(s) in addition to the requirements of this
chapter. In addition, the following rules shall apply within the Supplemental
Review Districts.
      (1)    Underground Districts. A Wireless Provider shall comply with
reasonable and nondiscriminatory requirements that prohibit the installation of
Poles in the ROW in an Underground District where:
         A.   No less than sixty days prior to the submission of the
Application, the Municipality has required all such lines to be placed
underground;
         B.   Poles the Municipality allows to remain are made available to
Wireless Providers for the Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities and may be
replaced by a Wireless Provider to accommodate the Collocation of Small
Wireless Facilities in compliance with this Ordinance; and
         C.   A Wireless Provider is allowed to install a new Pole when it is
not able to provide Wireless Services by Collocating on a remaining Pole or
Support Structure.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit the use or replacement of existing Poles
or Support Structures in Underground Districts for the Collocation of Small
Wireless Facilities subject to appropriate design and concealment measures and
a finding that such use or replacement does not increase the height of the Pole
or Support Structure by more than three (3) feet.
For any such Application to install a new Pole in an Underground District, the
City may propose an alternate location in the ROW within two hundred fifty
(250) feet of the location set forth in the Application. The Wireless Provider
shall use the City’s proposed alternate location unless the location is not
Technically Feasible or imposes significant additional costs. The Wireless
Provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in good faith,
based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in Ohio, and it shall provide a
written summary of the basis for such determination. For Small Wireless
Facilities installed before the City establishes an Underground District, the
City shall either permit Wireless Providers to
maintain the Small Wireless Facilities in place or permit the Wireless Provider
to replace the associated Pole within fifty (50) feet of the prior location. In
the latter case, the Wireless Provider shall allow other Communications Service
Providers with attachments on the existing Pole to place those attachments on
the replacement Pole under the same or reasonably similar fees, rates, terms,
and conditions as applied to those attachments on the existing Pole.
      (2)    Historic and Underground Districts. The City may require
reasonable, Technically Feasible, nondiscriminatory, and technologically
neutral design and aesthetic requirements, stealth requirements, height
limitations of no less than forty feet, and/or concealment measures in a
Underground District or Historic District. For Applications to place Poles in a
Underground District or a Historic District to deploy Small Wireless
Facilities, the City may propose an alternate location in the ROW within two
hundred fifty (250) feet of the location set forth in the Application. The
Wireless Provider shall use the City’s proposed alternate location unless the
location is not Technically Feasible or imposes significant additional costs.
The Wireless Provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in
good faith, based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in Ohio, and it
shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.
This section may not be construed to limit a City’s authority to enforce
historic preservation zoning regulations consistent with the preservation of
local zoning authority under Chapter
1341 of the Codified Ordinances, the requirements for facility modifications
under Small Cell Design Guidelines and Requirements Exhibit A, or the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. Section 300101 et seq.), and the
regulations adopted to implement those laws.
   
   (d)   Appeals, Special Exceptions, and Variance Requirements. Appeals of
administrative decisions and requests for special exceptions and variances from
the provisions of this chapter, when strict application would result in an
unnecessary hardship or in the inability to deploy needed Small Wireless
Facilities, shall be heard and decided by the Board of Zoning Appeals or
equivalent board for Supplemental Review Districts. An Applicant seeking a
special exception to construct a new Decorative Pole, Pole, or Support
Structure to Collocate a Small Wireless Facility in an Underground District
shall demonstrate, including certification through an engineer, that it has
diligently attempted to locate the proposed Decorative Pole, Pole, Support
Structure, or Small Wireless Facility outside of the Underground District and
that placement of the Decorative Pole, Pole, Support Structure, or Small
Wireless Facility within the Underground District is necessary to provide the
needed wireless coverage or capacity, and one or more of the following
conditions exist supporting a Special Exception:
      (1)   No existing Pole or Support Structure is located within the
location search radius or to the extent a Pole or Support Structure is located
within the search radius, such Pole or Support Structure:
         A.   Is not available for Collocation under commercially reasonable
rates, terms, and conditions;
         B.   Cannot accommodate the Collocation of the Small Wireless Facility
and meet the technical requirements necessary to deliver adequate wireless
service coverage or capacity; or
         C.   Would require modifications exceeding the height limitation
imposed in Small Cell Design Guidelines and Requirements Exhibit A; or
      (2)    The only available option to deliver adequate wireless service
coverage or capacity in the search radius requires modifications to an existing
Pole or Support Structure exceeding the height limitation imposed in Small Cell
Design Guidelines and Requirements Exhibit A or the installation of a new Pole
or Support Structure for Collocation of a Small Wireless Facility, or
      (3)    The applicant has demonstrated other circumstances that, in the
reasonable discretion of the applicable review body, warrant a special
exception or variance.
   The Applicant shall abide by the design, stealth, and concealment treatments
imposed as conditions of the special exception.
   (e)   Existing Supplemental Review Districts. [Supplemental Review Districts
approved by the City as of the effective date of this chapter are listed in
Small Cell Design Guidelines and Requirements Exhibit A.] Nothing in this
chapter shall prohibit or otherwise limit the City from establishing additional
Supplemental Review Districts, provided however, that facilities and structures
for which a Permit was approved or deemed approved pursuant to this chapter
prior to the establishment of the additional Supplemental Review District
remain subject to the provisions of this chapter, including routine maintenance
and replacement of those facilities and structures as set out herein. If a
Wireless Provider voluntarily replaces such facilities in a manner that does
not comply Small Cell Design Guidelines and Requirements Exhibit A Ordinance,
or if a Wireless Provider voluntarily relocates such facilities, such
replacement or relocation is subject to the then-existing provisions and
requirements of the additional Supplemental Review District.
   
   (f)   Decorative Poles. Subject to the City’s ability to deny an Application
as set forth in this chapter, a Wireless Provider must be permitted to
Collocate on or replace Decorative Poles when necessary to deploy a Small
Wireless Facility.
      (1)   The City may require the Collocation on a Decorative Pole or the
replacement of a Decorative Pole to reasonably conform to the design aesthetics
of the original Decorative Pole, provided these requirements are Technically
Feasible.
      (2)   For Applications to Collocate Small Wireless Facilities on
Decorative Poles or to replace Decorative Poles to deploy Small Wireless
Facilities, the City may propose an alternate location in the ROW within two
hundred fifty (250) feet of the location set forth in the Application. The
Wireless Provider shall use the City’s proposed alternate location unless the
location is not Technically Feasible or imposes significant additional costs.
The Wireless Provider shall certify that it has made such a determination in
good faith, based on the assessment of an engineer licensed in Ohio, and it
shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.
   (g)   Repair of Damage. A Wireless Provider shall repair all damage to the
ROW directly caused by the activities of the Wireless Provider in the ROW and
shall restore the ROW to its condition before the damage occurred. If within
thirty (30) calendar days after written notice the Wireless Provider fails to
the extent practicable in the reasonable judgment of the City to restore the
ROW to its condition prior to the damage in compliance with this subsection,
the City may, at the sole discretion of the City , restore the ROW to such
condition and charge the applicable party the reasonable, documented cost of
the restoration, plus a penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00)
provided; however, that the Wireless Provider may request additional time to
make such repairs, and the City shall not unreasonably deny such a request. The
City may suspend the ability of the Wireless Provider to receive any new
Permits from the City until the Wireless Provider has paid the amount assessed
for such restoration costs. The City shall not suspend such ability of any
Applicant that has deposited the amount in controversy in escrow pending an
adjudication of the merits of the dispute.

installing additional Facilities or any part of a Facility, the posting of a
Construction Bond and Removal Bond, acceptable to the City and subject to
Chapter 1149, for the additional Facilities or any part of a Facility is
required.
         M.   Upon request, the Service Director may modify or waive the
information requirements if they are not necessary in evaluating the
Construction Permit application. The Service Director may request applicable
and pertinent additional information if it is necessary in evaluating the
Construction Permit application.
   (c)   Issuance of Permit; Conditions. If the City determines that the
Applicant has satisfied the requirements of Chapter 1149 and the Construction
Permit process, the Service Director shall issue a Construction Permit subject
to the provisions of this Section
1149.10(c)(2). The City may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of
the Construction Permit and the performance of the Permittee thereunder in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the
structural integrity of the Right-Of-Way, to protect the property and safety of
other users of the Right-Of-Way, and to minimize the disruption and
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Construction Permit Fees.
      (1)   The City shall annually calculate Construction Permit Fees and
appropriately revise any prior year's Construction Permit Fees based upon the
formula and calculations described in this Section
1149.l5(d). Construction Permit Fees shall remain in effect until the City's
next annual modification of the Construction Permit Fees.
      (2)   The City, on or about January 1st of each year, shall calculate all
the actual and incurred Construction Permit issuance, inspection, oversight,
enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year including the
value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the Right-Of-Way
that will result from Construction that takes place therein. "Degradation and
the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this Section means the
accelerated depreciation of the Right-Of-Way caused by Construction in or
disturbance of the Right-Of-Way, resulting in the need to reconstruct or repair
such Right-Of-Way earlier than would be required if the Construction did not
occur.
      (3)   The City, on or about January 1st of each year; shall total all the
Construction Permit Fee receipts received in accordance with the scheduled fees
required by the prior year's Construction Permit Fees for the previous calendar
year.
      (4)   The City shall divide the calculated costs referenced in Section
1149.10(d)(2) herein, by the total Construction Permit Fees received as
referenced in Section
1149.10(d)(3) herein, to arrive at a numerical factor representing the previous
year's cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)   The City shall multiply the then currently codified Construction
Permit Fees by the numerical factor as referenced in Section
1149.15(d)(4) herein, to calculate revised Permit Fees for the new calendar
year.
      (6)   The City shall act, on or about January 31st of each year, in
accordance with the results of Section
1149.15(d)(5), to codify new annual Permit Fees by separate legislation enacted
by Council by appropriately increasing or decreasing the previous year's Permit
Fees. Revised Permit Fees shall be effective upon passage. Any Permit requests
pending on the date of any annual Permit Fee modification shall be subject to
all new Permit Fees as modified.
      (7)   Except as provided in subsection Section
1149.15(d)(8) herein, no Construction Permit shall be issued without payment of
Construction Permit Fees except to the City (exclusive of its enterprise fund
agencies which shall be required to obtain Construction Permits) which shall be
exempt. Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit that the City has
revoked due to breach and in accordance with the terms of Sections
1149.10 or
1149 13(e) are not refundable.
      (8)   The City Auditor may permit a Permittee to make quarterly payments
of Construction Permit Fees based upon the Permittee's financial condition and
past payment history. The quarterly payment shall be due and payable within
thirty (30) days after the end of the quarter. The City Auditor may revoke this
permission due to a change in financial condition, late payment, or other just
cause.
   (e)   Joint Applications.  Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
Applications for Construction Permits to work in the Right-Of-Way at the same
place and time. Joint Applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
Construction Permit Fees.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
    1149.11 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial Construction, extension, or
relocation of Facilities in the Right-Of-Way, except for repair, maintenance or
replacement with like Facilities or relocations requested or caused by a third
party (excluding the City) or another Permittee, a Permittee shall conduct a
utility engineering study on the proposed route of Construction expansion or
relocation unless the Service Director issues a written exception. Where such
Construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
Permittee located within the Right-Of-Way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all Best Efforts to cooperate and assist any other Permittee or
person who is directed by the City to perform the required utility engineering
study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum, completion of the
following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C,   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Right-Of-Way along the proposed route. Upon
request of the Service Director, a Permittee shall also record and identify the
general location of all other Facilities in the Right-Of-Way along the proposed
route. For the purposes of this Section, general location shall mean the
alignment of other Facilities in the Right-Of-Way but shall not necessarily
mean the depth of other Facilities in the Right-Of-Way.
         D.   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in Section
 1149.11(a)(1)A. - C. herein, on the Construction Permittee's proposed route
maps and Construction plans.
         E.   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing Underground Facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with Section
 1149.11(a)(1)D., Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Director of Public Works, a Permittee
shall not excavate more than a three (3) feet by three (3) feet square hole in
the Right-Of-Way to complete this task.
         F.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed design to avoid the need to
relocate other Underground Facilities.
      (2)   The Service Director may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed Construction plans.
   (b)   Copy to City. Upon completion of the tasks described in Section
1149.11(a) above, the Construction Permittee shall submit, if necessary labeled
in accordance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 1020.06(B), the proposed route
maps and Construction Plans, with the results of the utility engineering study,
in the most advanced format (including, but not limited to electronic and/or
digital format) then currently being used by the Permittee that the City is
capable of reading (or readily converting to a readable form). The mapping data
is only required to be at the "Atlas" level of detail necessary for the City to
reasonably determine the location of the Permittee's Facilities in the Right-
Of-Way. The Permittee shall supply the mapping data on paper if the Service
Director determines that the format currently being used by the Permittee is
not capable of being read by the City.
   (c)   Qualified Firm.  All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the Permittee if in the discretion of the
Service Director the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself. Alternatively, utility engineering studies shall be performed
by a firm specializing in utility engineering that is approved by the City.
   (d)   Cost of Study. The Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
Section
1149.11(a)-(c).
   (e)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in Chapter
1149 or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Service Director waives any
of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a
Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction schedule to the
City five (5) Working Days before commencing any work in or about the Right-Of-
Way, and shall further notify the City not less than one (1) Working Day in
advance of any excavation in the Right-Of-Way. This Section shall apply to all
situations with the exception of circumstances under Section
1149.13(d)(l) (Emergency Situations) and Section
1149.12 (Minor Maintenance) herein.
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable Laws and the City's Rules and Regulations.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional Facilities within the Right-Of-Way if the Right-Of-Way is
full, or if the area is designated solely for undergrounding in accordance with
Section 4939.0314 of the Ohio Revised Code. In making such decisions, the City
shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential
users of the Right-Of-Way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of
the public health, safety and welfare, the condition of the Right-Of-Way, the
time of year with respect to essential Utilities, the protection of existing
Facilities in the Right-Of-Way, future City and County plans for public
improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in the
public interest and nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among
Permittees.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Right-Of-Way. Specifically, every Permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize Trenchless
Technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, and microtunneling. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable
installed in the subsurface Right-Of-Way pursuant to Chapter
1149 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable,
wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to Chapter
1149 using "direct bury" techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions. The City may grant a special exception to the
requirements of Sections
1149.11(f) and
1149.11(g) if a Permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare;
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the Permittee's Construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the Permittee to provide Services in the City.
      (3)   The Permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the Permittee in favor of another Person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the City herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the Permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the City.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A Permittee shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Right-Of-Way
whenever the City finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation. In
instances where the City requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall
waive all applicable Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation,
the Permittee shall restore the Right-Of-Way to the same or better condition it
was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to
be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
poles of the same or similar size. In accordance with Law, the Service Director
may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable
interference by the Permittee's Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City;
         B.   The public health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to
prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over
the Right-Of-Way; or
         C.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a Right-Of-Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Permittee who has Facilities in
the Right-Of-Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for
the purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. 723.041.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Permittee fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated by the City,
within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order, or if a Permittee fails
to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair of the
Right-Of-Way of the City, within twelve (12) months thereafter, then, to the
extent not inconsistent with applicable Law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Permittee
in, on, over or under the Right-Of-Way of the City at Permittee's cost and
expense, by another Person; however, the City shall have no liability for any
damage caused by such action and the Permittee shall be liable to the City for
all reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Permittee's Facilities in, on, over or under the Right-Of-Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Permittee
shall belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the
Permittee, and the Permittee shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
City shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence
such ownership by the City.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. Before the start date of any
Right-Of-Way excavation, each Permittee who has Facilities located in the area
to be excavated shall, to the best of its ability, mark the horizontal and
approximate vertical placement of all its Facilities. All Permittees shall also
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to
establish the exact location of its Facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.
   (k)   Right-Of-Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Right-Of-Way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
Rules and Regulations. If a Permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of Right-Of-Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the Permittee shall complete the restoration of the Right-Of-Way as soon as
weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify
the City.
      (2)   In approving an Application for a Construction Permit, the City may
choose either to have the Permittee restore the Right-Of-Way or alternatively
to restore the Right-Of-Way itself if the Permittee has in the past not abided
by requirements of Chapter
1149.
      (3)   If the City allows a Permittee to restore the Right-Of-Way, the
Permittee may at the time of Application for a Construction Permit be required
to post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Right-Of-Way to its approximate
pre-excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
Restoration of the Right-Of-Way, the City determines that the Right-Of-Way have
been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be released.
      (4)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the City. The City shall have the authority to
prescribe the manner and extent of the Restoration and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The City in
exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and
considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the Right-Of-Way; the traffic volume carried by the
Right-Of-Way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the Right-Of-Way;
the pre-excavation condition of the Right-Of-Way; the remaining life-expectancy
of the Right-Of-Way affected by the excavation; whether the relative cost of
the method of Restoration to the Permittee is in reasonable balance with the
prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the Right-Of-Way that would
otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the Right-Of-
Way; and the likelihood that the particular method of Restoration would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the Right-Of-Way that would otherwise
take place. Methods of Restoration may include, but are not limited to,
patching the affected area, replacement of the Right-Of-Way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the Right-Of-Way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the Right-Of-Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Service Director, correct all Restoration work to the extent necessary using
the method required by the Service Director. Weather permitting, said work
shall be completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice
from the Service Director, unless otherwise extended by the Service Director.
      (6)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Right-Of-Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may do such
work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30)
days of billing, the Restoration cost of restoring the Right-Of-Way and any
other costs incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call upon
any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all
legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the Permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the City and/ or another
Permittee(s), then the Service Director may reasonably apportion the
Restoration responsibility among the City, Permittees and/or other Persons.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   Each Permittee shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
City-owned Facilities in the Right-Of-Way which the Permittee or its Facilities
damage.
      (2)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Permittee seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the Right-Of-Way and finds it necessary, as may be allowed by
Law, to maintain, support, or move a Permittee's Facilities to protect those
Facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that Permittee and
shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to
pay, the City may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a
Permittee does not pay, or the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit
posted by the Permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.
Each Permittee shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
Facilities of another Permittee caused during the City's response to an
Emergency occasioned by that Permittee's Facilities.
      
   (m)   Right-Of-Way Vacation.  If the City sells or otherwise transfers a
Right-Of-Way which contains the Facilities of a Permittee, such sale or
transfer shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements
required pursuant to Ohio R.C. 723.041.
   (n)   Installation Requirements.  The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Right-Of-Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Service Director.
   (o)   Inspection. When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is
completed, the Permittee shall notify the Service Director.
      (1)   The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by Law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the terms and
conditions of the Permit and/or Chapter
1149.
      (3)   The Inspector may issue an order to the Permittee for any work
which does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee at
pursuant to Section
1149.28(d). An order may be appealed to the Service Director. The decision of
the Service Director may be appealed to the Mayor whose decision shall be
final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the
Permittee shall present proof to the Service Director that the violation has
been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time,
the Service Director may revoke the Permit pursuant to Section
1149.13(e).
   (p)   Other Obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other Laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all Laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
Laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the Right-Of-Way
pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No Right-Of-Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section
1149.13(d)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a Right-Of-Way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Service Director may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary Construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the Permit.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required. Where not otherwise required to be placed
underground by Chapter
1149 and in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4939.0314(G) to the extent it is in
effect a Permittee shall locate Facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of Facilities underground
is consistent with the Permittee's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical Facilities are home directly by the
property owner making the request. A Permittee, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the City, always use Best Efforts to place
Facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and Facilities
installed), all Facilities to be installed by a Permittee under the Right-of-
Way shall be installed in conduit.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.12 MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMIT.
   (a)   Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit Requirement. No Person shall
perform Minor Maintenance of Facilities in the Right-Of-Way without first
having obtained a Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit as set forth in this
Chapter. Minor Maintenance means: (i) the routine repair or replacement of

Ways, other than thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic and
is for a period of less than eight (8) contiguous hours; (iv) Construction
other than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes less than eight (8)
contiguous hours to complete, does not impede traffic and does not involve a
pavement cut; (v) minor and/or non-material vegetation management/tree pruning.
The Service Director may adopt Rules and Regulations pursuant to Section
1149.18 that clarify the definition of Minor Maintenance and/or provide a
process for a Permittee to determine whether particular activity constitutes
Minor Maintenance.
      (1)   A Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit allows the Right of Way
Minor Maintenance Permittee to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the
Right-Of-Way as required.
      (2)   A Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit is valid from the date of
issuance until revoked by the Service Director.
      (3)   A Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance permit must be displayed or upon
request produced within twelve (12) business hours.
      (4)   A Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a Permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Service Director.
   (b)   Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permits Are Not Required For: The
routine maintenance of Wireless Facilities, or the replacement of Wireless
Facilities with Wireless Facilities that are consistent with the City's current
design guidelines and are either substantially similar to the existing Wireless
Facilities or the same size or smaller than the existing Wireless Facilities.
   (c)   Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit Applications. Application for a
Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit shall be made to the Service Director. In
addition to any information required by the Director of Public Works, all
Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit Applications shall contain, and will only
be considered complete upon compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the Applicant has obtained a Right-Of-Way
Occupancy Permit or proof that the Applicant has written authority to apply for
a Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit on behalf of a party that has been

   (d)   Issuance of Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permits; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Service Director determines that the Applicant has satisfied
the requirements of this Chapter and the Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit
process, the Service Director shall issue a Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance
Permit subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
      (2)   The City may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to the Rules
and Regulations enacted by the Service Director, upon the issuance of the
Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit and the performance of the Right of Way
Minor Maintenance Permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the Right-Of-Way, to
protect the property and safety of other users of the Right-Of-Way, and to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (e)   Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The Service Director shall
not charge a fee for the issuance of the Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit
but may revoke the Right-Of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit as any other Permit
may be revoked under this Chapter.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.13 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit.  Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any Person who has not yet made an Application;
      (2)   To any Person who has outstanding debt owed to the City unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the City
Auditor;
      (3)   To any Person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a Permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Service Director, the issuance of a
Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere
with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The Service
Director, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Right-Of-Way, and by
considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit. The Service Director may deny a Permit in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference
with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Right-Of-Way, or
when necessary to protect the Right-Of-Way and its users.
      (1)   The Service Director, in his/her discretion, may consider one or
more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which Right-Of-Way space where the Permit is sought
is available;
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the Right-Of-
Way;
         C.   The availability of other locations in the Right-Of-Way or in
another Right-Of-Way for the proposed Facilities;
         D.   The applicability of Chapter
1149 or other regulations of the Right-Of-Way that affect location of
Facilities in the Right-Of-Way;
         E.   The degree of compliance of the Permittee with the terms and

         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Right-Of-Way;
         G.   The condition and age of the Right-Of-Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction;
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the Right-Of-Way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the Right-Of-Way; or,
         I.   Whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of Chapter
1149 or, if applicable, any other Law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within twenty-four (24) months after construction completion
or a newly reconstructed street within twenty-four (24) months of
reconstruction completion, except where:
         A.   An Emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
         B.   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; or
         C.   The Service Director determines it is in the best interests of
the City that such an open cut take place.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1149.13(a)(1) and Section
1149.13(a)(2), the Service Director may issue a Permit in any case where the
Permit is necessary;
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
Permit Applicant, if established by Credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
         B.   To allow such customer to materially improve its Service; or
         C.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
Permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a Permit under this Section, the Permit Applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
Service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each Permittee shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Service Director of any event regarding its Facilities which it considers
to be an Emergency. The Permittee may proceed to take whatever actions are
necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within five (5) business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Service Director, after the occurrence or
discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Permittee shall apply for
the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with Chapter
1149 for any and all actions taken in response to the Emergency. In the event
that the City becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a Permittee's Facilities,
the City shall use Best Efforts to contact the Permittee or the Representative
of each Permittee affected, or potentially affected, by the Emergency. In any
event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond
to the Emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the Permittee whose
Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an Emergency, any Permittee who Constructs
in, on, above, within, over, below or through a Right-Of-Way without a· valid
Permit must subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double the normal fee for said
Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with the
City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Right-Of-Way and comply
with all of the requirements of Chapter
1149.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Code as a privilege
and not as a right. The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke
any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial breach of
the terms and conditions of any Law, or any provision or condition of the
Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, any of the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit;
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens;
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a
Permit;
         D.   The failure to maintain the required Construction or Removal
Bonds and /or insurance;

Way Occupancy Permit;
         F.   The failure to complete the Construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant to
Section
1149.11(o)(3)
      (2)   If the Service Director determines that the Permittee has committed
a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any condition of the
Permit, the Service Director shall serve a written demand upon the Permittee to
remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be
cause for revocation of the Permit. Upon a substantial breach, as stated above,
the Service Director may place additional or revised conditions on the Permit.
      (3)   By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Service Director with a
plan, acceptable to the Service Director, for its correction. Permittee's
failure to so contact the Service Director, or the Permittee's failure to
submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure to reasonably implement the
approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the Permit.
      (4)   If a Permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked, and the Permittee will
not be allowed further Permits for up to and including one (1) full year,
except for Emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation. (Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.14 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond.  Prior to the commencement of any Construction, a
Construction Permittee, excluding the County, shall deposit with the Service
Director an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in
an amount determined by the Service Director to be appropriate based upon fair
and reasonable criteria. Unless a Construction default, problem or deficiency
involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the
Service Director shall serve written notice to the Construction Permittee
detailing the Construction default, problem or deficiency. If the Service
Director determines that correction or repair of the Construction default,
problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not been substantially initiated
within ten (10) calendar days after the date following service and notification
and detailing the Construction default, problem or deficiency, then the City
may attach the letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice
shall be served on the Construction Permittee by the Service Director.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit and
continuously thereafter, and until one hundred twenty (120) days after a
Permittee's Facilities have been removed from the Right-Of-Way, (unless the
Service Director notifies the Permittee that a reasonably longer period shall
apply), a Permittee shall deposit with the Service Director and maintain an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal
to or greater than One hundred thousand dollars (US$100,000.00), the Service
Director shall make all reasonable efforts to allow Permittee a period of five
(5) calendar days after serving notification in writing to correct or repair
any default, problem or deficiency prior to the Service Director attachment of
the letter of credit or surety bond regarding the removal of Facilities. Upon
attachment, written notice shall be provided to the Permittee by the Service
Director.
   (c)   Blanket Bond.  In lieu of the Construction Bond required by Section
1149.14(a) and the Removal Bond required by Section
1149.14(b), Permittee may deposit with the Director of Public Services an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of
five million dollars (US$5,000,000.00). Unless a Construction default, problem
or deficiency involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general
public, the Service Director shall make all reasonable effort to allow
Permittee a period of five (5) calendar days after sending notification in
writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to
Service Director's attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond.
   (d)   Self Bonding. In lieu of the Construction Bond required by Section
 1149.14(a), the Removal Bond required by Section
1149.14(b) and the Blanket Bond required by Section
1149.19(c), those Permittees maintaining a book value in excess of fifty
million dollars (US $50,000,000.00) may submit a statement to the Service
Director requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-bond is granted, a
Permittee shall assure the City that such self-bonding shall provide the City
with no less protection and security than would have been afforded to the City
by a third-party surety providing Permittee with the types and amounts of bonds
detailed in the above-named Sections. This statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year;
      (2)   A description of the Applicant's self-bonding program; and,
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Director of Public Works.
   (e)   Purposes. The bonds required by this section, and any self-bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the Permittee of all terms, conditions
and obligations of Chapter
1149;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the Permittee or Permittee's violation of Chapter
1149 or its failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders, Permits and
other directives of the City issued pursuant to Chapter
1149; and
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including Permit
Fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance
required pursuant to Chapter 1149;
      (5)   The removal of Facilities from the Right-Of-Way pursuant to Chapter
1149;
      (6)   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the Permittee is
liable that are not paid by its insurance or other surety; and,
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to Chapter
1149 or the Law.
   (f)   Form.  The bond documents required by this Section and any replacement
bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the Facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to City of surety's
intention to cancel or not renew this bond.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
    1149.15 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each Permittee shall, at the
time of initial Application and by January 1 of each following year, file a
Construction and Major Maintenance Plan with the Director of Public Service.
Such Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall be provided for all
geographical areas requested by the Director of Public Service, up to and
including the entire geographical area of the City. It shall be submitted using
a format(s) mutually agreeable to the Permittee and the City and shall contain
the information determined by the Director of Public Service to be necessary to
facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency of Construction in
the Right-Of-Way. The Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall include,
but not be limited to all currently scheduled and/or anticipated Construction
projects for the next calendar year, and if none are scheduled or anticipated
then the Plan shall so state. The Permittee shall use its Best Efforts in
supplying this information and shall update the Construction and Major
Maintenance Plan on file with the Director of Public Service whenever there is
a material change in scheduled and/or anticipated Construction projects. In an
effort to assist Permittees with the completion of their annual Construction
and Major Maintenance Plan, the Director of Public Service, on or before
October 1st of each year, will send each Permittee's Representative a
descriptive narrative (and any mapping information reasonably available) for
all the planned Right of Way improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the
City then currently intends to undertake during the next calendar year. The
City may, in its sole discretion, update and/or modify the descriptive
narrative and mapping information provided.
   (b)   Mapping Data. With the filing of its Application for a Right-Of-Way
Occupancy Permit, a Permittee shall be required to accurately inform the City
of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right-Of-Way the
Permittee then currently occupies and begin submitting to the City all
information that currently exists and which can be provided regarding the
location of its Facilities in the Right-Of-Way in hard copy or in the most
advanced format (including, but not limited to, electronic and/or digital
format) then currently being used by the Permittee that the City is capable of
reading or readily converting to a readable form. Unless otherwise required by
Section
1149.10(b), a Permittee shall have up to one (1) year from the date of the
Permittee's initial filing of an Application for a Right-Of-Way Occupancy
Permit to completely submit all the mapping data in the entire geographical
area of the City which it owns or over which it has control that are located in
any Right-Of-Way of the City. The mapping data is only required to be at the
"Atlas" level of detail necessary for the City to reasonably determine the
location of the Permittee's Facilities in the Right-Of-Way. Any time after the
issuance of a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit, and upon the reasonable request of
the Director of Public Service, a Permittee shall be required to provide to the
City any additional location information for any Facilities which it owns or
over which it has control that are located in any Right-Of-Way of the City
required by the City. Any and all actual direct, incidental and indirect costs
incurred by the City during the process of reviewing, inputting and/or
converting a Permittee's mapping information to comport with the City's then
current standard format (whether electronic or otherwise) shall be directly
billed to, and must be timely remitted by, the Permittee. Failure to pay such
mapping costs within sixty (60) days of receipt of an invoice shall subject an
Applicant or Permittee to revocation of its Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit and
the penalties of Section
 1149.99. Further, each Permittee that has been issued a Right-Of-Way Occupancy
Permit shall accurately inform the City on or before each subsequent January
1st of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right-Of-Way the
Permittee's then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1st. The
Director of Public Service may, in the future, adopt additional specifications
and further define or modify the mapping data requirements under this section
for reasons including, but not limited to, changes in technology or the Law
regarding public disclosure of a Permittee's mapping information. When the City
modifies and/or amends
the mapping data requirements, the City shall use Best Efforts to avoid
unreasonably increasing the burden to the Permittees that may be associated
with satisfying the amended mapping requirements. When the mapping requirements
of Section
 1149.15(b) are amended, each Permittee shall be served with a copy of the new
specifications or modifications by regular U.S. Mail to the representative
identified in each Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit; provided, however, that any
failure of any Permittee to actually receive such notice shall not in any way
affect the validity or enforceability of said specifications or modifications.
   (c)   Exemption from Disclosure.  In the event that the City receives a
request from a third party for the disclosure of information a provider has
clearly marked as Confidential/Proprietary Information, the City shall respond
in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 149. However, the City will endeavor to
notify the Permittee of any such request prior to making the subject document
(s) available for inspection or copying, at which point it will be the
Permittee's sole and exclusive responsibility to take whatever steps it deems
necessary to protect such documents from disclosure.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
    1149.16 COMPENSATION.
   (a)   As compensation for the City's costs to administer Chapter
1149, manage, administer and control the Right-Of-Way and maintain each Right-
Of-Way Occupancy Permit issued, every Permittee shall pay to the City a
Registration Maintenance Fee. The Registration Maintenance Fee shall be
determined and assessed to Permittees and other Persons operating or otherwise
using and occupying the Right-Of-Way in accordance with the following process
and formula:
      (1)   The City by February 28th of each year, shall calculate all actual
and incurred costs associated with Right-Of-Way management, administration and
control for the previous calendar year that the City was not able to reasonably
recover through Construction Permit Fees or other recovery mechanisms provided
for in Chapter
1149.
      (2)   Permittees and Applicants, as required in Section
 1149.15(b), shall accurately inform the City upon application for a Right-Of-
Way Occupancy Permit and on or before each subsequent January 1st of the number
of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right-of-Way the Permittee's
Facilities occupied as of the immediately previous December.
      (3)   The City shall total the entire number of miles of Right-Of-Way
reported as being used or occupied by all Permittees.
      (4)   The City shall divide the calculated costs referenced in Section
1149.16(a)(1) by the total number of miles of Right-Of-Way reported as being
used or occupied by all Permittees as referenced in Section
1149.16(a)(3) to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)   The City shall then multiply each Permittee's mileage calculation
as referenced in Section
1149.16(a)(2) by the per-mile cost calculation referenced in Section
1149.16(a)(4). The product shall be a Permittee's annual Registration
Maintenance Fee.
      (6)   The City shall perform its annual calculation of Registration
Maintenance Fees following receipt of the Permittees required December mileage
report. Registration Maintenance Fees shall be invoiced to Permittees on or
about March 1 of each calendar year and shall be due thirty (30) days following
receipt.
      (7)   Cable companies operating under non-exclusive Cable Franchises for
the purposes of providing Cable Service, Video Services Permittee operating
under a VSA for the purpose of providing Video Services, and Permittees of Open
Video System services, which compensate the City under other mechanisms in an
amount equal to or greater than the Annual Registration Maintenance Fee that
would normally be required for their Right of Way use in The City, shall have
the mileage of the Right-Of-Way they use and/or occupy included in the
calculations described in Section
1149.16, but shall not be required to contribute to the recovery of Right-Of-
Way Costs as defined by Chapter
1149 with the exception of Permit Costs.
      (8)   The City may by separate legislation enacted by City Council on or
about February 28th of each year, in accordance with the results of Section
1149.16(a)(4), enact an initial and thereafter a new annual Registration
Maintenance Fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or decreasing the
previous year(s) Registration Maintenance Fee (per mile). Revised Registration
Maintenance Fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (b)   Timing. Registration Maintenance Fees shall be paid each calendar year
in accordance with Section
 1149.16(a)(6). Registration Maintenance Fees shall be paid in full for the
first year of the registration as a condition of the Right-Of-Way Occupancy
Permit becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date of the
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit to the end of the calendar year if less than one
(1) full year.
   (c)   Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by any taxing authority or community authority on the use of City
property as a result of a Permittee's use or occupation of the Right-Of-Way,
the Permittee shall be responsible for payment of such taxes or assessments.
Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to
Chapter
1149 and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and
charges listed in Chapter
1149. The Registration Maintenance Fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other
assessment except as specifically provided in Chapter
1149, or as required by applicable Law.
   (d)   Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any Registration
Maintenance Fee is not paid to the City by April 1, the Permittee shall pay a
monthly late charge of one percent (1 %) of the unpaid balance for each month
or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction.  No acceptance by the City of any
Registration Maintenance Fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
Registration Maintenance Fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
City may have for additional sums payable.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.17 CITY USE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Except for traffic control Facilities and Facilities in place as of
the effective date of this Chapter, Facilities that are the subject of other
agreements between the City and a Permittee, or as otherwise provided by law,
the City shall not install or maintain upon any poles and within any
underground pipes or conduits or other Facilities of any general Right-Of-Way
Occupancy Permittee, any Facilities desired by the City for the City's use
without the consent of such Permittee unless: (i) such installation and
maintenance is lawful and consistent with good engineering and construction
practice and all appropriate safety codes; (ii) such installation and
maintenance does not unreasonably and materially interfere with existing and
future operations of the Permittee; (iii) such installation and maintenance is
not unduly burdensome to such Permittee; (iv) the City enters into an agreement
with the Permittee which specifies other appropriate and reasonable terms and
conditions, including compensation based upon the City's proportionate cost of
the Right-Of-Way, and including compensation governing the use of Permittee's
Facilities; and (v) the City's use is non-discriminatory. Each Permittee shall
cooperate with the City in the development of a facility use agreement for such
City Facilities. Each Permittee shall cooperate with the City in planning and
designing its Facilities so as to accommodate the City's reasonably disclosed
requirements in this regard. Copies of all agreements hereunder shall be filed
with the Mayor or his designee.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.18 ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.
   (a)   In accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section,
the Mayor may promulgate regulations, as the Mayor or his designee deems
appropriate from time to time, to carry out the express purposes and intent of
this chapter.
   (b)   Such regulations shall not materially increase the obligations of any
Permittee hereunder. In promulgating such regulations, including those related
to Section
1149.06, the Mayor shall, among other appropriate factors, consider the costs
of Permittee compliance as an important factor in determining the
appropriateness of the regulations.
   (c)   The Mayor shall promulgate proposed regulations by forwarding
legislation for City Council's consideration. Each General Right-Of-Way
Occupancy Permittee shall be served with a copy of the proposed regulations by
certified U.S. mail; provided, however, that any failure of any Permittee to
actually receive such notice shall not in any way affect the validity or
enforceability of such regulation. Any person, including any Permittee, may
file specific written comments or objections on the proposed regulations within
a thirty (30)-day period after publication of notice of intent in a publication
of general circulation (hereinafter "comment period"). The proposed regulations
shall become effective thirty (30) days after adoption by City Council, unless
such regulation is modified or rejected by City Council.
   (d)   The City Council may adopt emergency regulations to be immediately
effective, when the City Council determines the same to be appropriate or
required by the public health, safety or welfare; provided, however, that any
such regulation shall nonetheless be subject to the comment and review process
as set forth in subsection (d) of this section.

   1149.20 DISCONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS, ABANDONED AND UNUSED FACILITIES.
   (a)   Except for Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittees for residential purposes,
when the permit so allows, any Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittee that intends to
discontinue or is discontinuing its operations of any Facilities within the
Rights-Of-Way shall first:
      (1)   Submit a written notice to the Mayor, describing the portion of the
Facilities to be discontinued and abandoned, any plan for securing the same and
the proposed date of abandonment, which date shall not be less than sixty (60)
days from the date such notice is submitted to the Mayor or provide information
satisfactory to the Mayor that the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittees'
obligations for its Facilities in the Right-Of-Way under this section and any
other sections in the Chapter have been lawfully assumed by another Right-Of-
Way Occupancy Permittee;
      (2)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its Facilities in a manner that
promotes the City's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions to
efficiently and economically utilize limited Right-Of Way capacity. Such
proposal must be approved or denied by the Mayor. The Mayors denial of a
proposal to re-use its Facilities shall be made in writing and describe the
reasons for such a denial. The denial may be appealed by the Right-Of-Way
Occupancy Permittee to the Mayor. The decision of the Mayor shall be final;
      (3)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of Facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Mayor must approve or deny said proposal. The Mayor's denial of a proposal
to abandon Facilities in place shall be done in writing and describe the
reasons for such a denial. The denial may be appealed by the Right-Of-Way
Occupancy Permittee to the Mayor. The decision of the Mayor shall be final;
      (4)   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
Facilities in a manner acceptable to the City within a reasonable amount of
time if the City believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such
removal; or
      (5)   Submit to the City within a reasonable amount of time and in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its Facilities to the City. If a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittee
proceeds under this clause, the City may, at its option where lawful: (i)
purchase the Facilities; or, (ii) unless a valid removal bond has already been
posted, require the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittee to post a bond in an
amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably anticipated costs to be
incurred in removing the Facilities.
   (b)   Facilities of a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittee who fail to comply
with this section and which remain unused Facilities shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Abandoned Facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may
exercise any remedies or rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not
limited to:
      (1)   Abating the nuisance;
      (2)   Taking possession of the Facilities and restoring them to a useable
condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements of Ohio
R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
      (3)    Requiring removal of the Facilities by the Right-Of-Way Occupancy
Permittee or by the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittee's surety.
   (c)   If the City requires a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permittee to remove
unused Facilities in any Right-Of-Way, the City shall use reasonable efforts to
direct that this removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations
of the Right-Of-Way. If the City abates the nuisance it may take all action
necessary to recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not
limited to, those methods set forth in Ohio R.C. §715.261. The City shall have
no liability for any damage caused by such action and the Permittee shall be
liable to the City for all reasonable costs incurred by the City in such
action.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
    1149.21 REVOCATION.
   (a)   In addition to any other rights set out in this chapter, the City
reserves the right to revoke, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
subsection (b) of this section, any Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit in the event
such Permittee violates any material provision of this chapter, its Right-Of-
Way Occupancy Permit, Chapter
1149.
   (b)   The Mayor shall give a Permittee thirty (30) days prior written notice
of an intent to revoke said Permittee's Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit. Such
notice shall state the reasons for such action. If the Permittee cures the
violation or other cause within the thirty (30)-day notice period, or if the
Permittee initiates efforts satisfactory to the Mayor to remedy the stated
violation, the Mayor may rescind said notice of revocation. If the Permittee
does not cure the stated violation or other cause or undertake efforts
satisfactory to the Mayor to remedy the stated violation, the Mayor may
recommend said permit be revoked. After granting the Permittee an opportunity
to be heard in person or in writing, the City Council may revoke the Right-Of-
Way Occupancy Permit. Unless otherwise required by law, the decision of the
City Council shall be final.
   (c)   Unless otherwise permitted by the Mayor or required by law, if a
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit is revoked, all Facilities located in the Rights-
Of-Way or located upon public property pursuant to such permit shall be removed
and/or abandoned at the sole expense of the Permittee subject to applicable
law, including but not limited to Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.22 RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed so as to grant any right
or interest in any Right-Of-Way or public property other than that explicitly
set forth herein or in a permit.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the City from
constructing, maintaining, repairing or relocating any non-proprietary City
utility, including street lighting, telecommunications or like Facilities;
grading, paving, maintaining, repairing, relocating or altering any street,
public property or Right-Of-Way; or constructing, maintaining, relocating, or
repairing any sidewalk or other public work or improvement. To the extent that
such work requires temporary or permanent relocation or rearrangement of any
Facilities or structures of any Permittee, such relocating, or rearrangement
shall be accomplished at the sole cost of the Permittee in such time and in
such manner as set forth in the regulations.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.23 TEMPORARY MOVEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   In the event it is necessary to move or remove temporarily any of the
Permittee's wires, cables, poles, or other Facilities placed pursuant to this
chapter, in order to lawfully move a large object, vehicle, building or other
structure over the streets of the City, upon two weeks written notice by the
Mayor to the Permittee, the Permittee shall, at the expense of the person
requesting the temporary removal of such Facilities, comply with the Mayor's
request; provided that the Permittee's expense has been reasonably secured by
the person so requesting.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.24 ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP; RENEWAL.

either in whole or in part, other than to an Affiliate, without the prior
written consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Any assignment or transfer of Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit, including an
assignment or transfer by means of a fundamental corporate change, requires the
written approval of the City. For purposes of this section, fundamental
corporate change means the sale or transfer of a controlling interest in the

partner in a limited partnership, change from a limited to a general
partnership, incorporation of a partnership, or change in the control of a
partnership.
   (b)   The parties to the assignment or transfer of Right-Of-Way Occupancy
Permit shall make a written request to the City for its consent in the form of
the Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit Application. The City shall reply in writing
within sixty (60) days of actual receipt of the request and shall indicate its
approval of the request or its determination that a public hearing is
necessary. City may conduct a public hearing on the request within thirty (30)
days of such determination if it determines that a sale or transfer of the
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit adversely affects the City.
   (c)   Notice of a hearing shall be given fourteen (14) days prior to the
hearing by publishing notice thereof once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City. The notice shall contain the date, time and place of the hearing
and shall briefly state the substance of the action to be considered by City.
   (d)   The City will review the qualifications (including, but not limited to
legal, technical and financial where appropriate) of the proposed assignee or
transferee and terms of the existing Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit. City will
make its decision in writing setting forth any conditions for assignment or
transfer. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days of actual receipt of the
request for assignment or transfer, the City shall approve or deny such
assignment or transfer request in writing.
   (e)   In no event shall a transfer or assignment of ownership or control be
ultimately acceptable to the City without transferee or assignee requesting and
being issued a replacement Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit within ninety (90)
days of transfer or assignment.
   (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no such consent or approval
shall be required for a transfer or assignment to any Person controlling,
controlled by or under the same common control of the original holder of the
Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.25 FORECLOSURE AND RECEIVERSHIP.
   (a)   Upon the filing of any voluntary or involuntary petition under the
Bankruptcy Act by or against the Permittee, or any action for foreclosure or
other judicial sale of the Permittee's Facilities located within the Right-Of-
Way, the Permittee shall promptly notify the Mayor, Service Director, and
Auditor of such fact.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
   1149.26 UNAUTHORIZED USE OF RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (a)   No Person shall use the Right-Of-Way to operate any Facility that has
not been authorized by the City in accordance with the terms of Chapter
1149 and been issued a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit.
   (b)   No Person shall place or have placed any Facilities in, on, above,
within, over, below, under, or through the Right-Of-Way, unless allowed under
Chapter
1149 or having been issued a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit.
   (c)   Each and every unauthorized use shall be deemed to be a violation and
a distinct and separate offense. Each and every day any violation of Chapter
1149 continues shall constitute a distinct and separate offense.
   (d)   No Person shall fail to comply with the provisions of Chapter
1149. Each and every failure to comply shall be deemed a distinct and separate
offense. Each and every day any violation of Chapter
1149 continues shall constitute a distinct and separate offense.
   (e)   The violation of any provision of Chapter 1149 shall be unlawful and a
misdemeanor offense. The penalty for any violation of Chapter
1149 shall be as provided in Section
1149.99.
   (f)   The Permittee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with
any of the provisions of its Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit or this chapter by
reason of any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance.
(Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
    1149.27 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Non-exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in Chapter
1149 are not exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City
may have at Law or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek
legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the public Right-
Of-Way, including damages to the Right-Of-Way, whether caused by a violation of
any of the provisions of Chapter
1149 or other provisions of the Code.
   (b)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of Chapter
1149 is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court
of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any Permit, right or any portions of this section are illegal or
unenforceable, then any such Permit or right granted or deemed to exist
hereunder shall be considered as a revocable Permit with a mutual right of
either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60) days written
notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable Permit
shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the Permit, right
or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of
the Permit and the right of termination. If a Permit or right shall be
considered a revocable Permit as provided herein, the Permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable Permit and the
power to revoke it.
   (c)   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers.  The City, by the
granting of a Permit or by issuing a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit pursuant to
Chapter
1149, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the
lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the
City under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Ohio and
under the Charter of the City to regulate the use of the Right-Of-Way. The
Permittee by its acceptance of a Permit, or Permittee by applying for and being
issued a Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all
lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as
now are or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the
City, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by
the City at any time. A Permittee or Permittee is deemed to acknowledge that
its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt
and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general Laws and
ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.
   (d)   Method of Service. Any notice or order of the Director of Service or
Mayor shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is:
      (1)   Delivered personally;
      (2)   Successfully transmitted via facsimile transmission to the last
known fax number of the person to be served;
      (3)   Left at the usual place of business of the person to whom it is to

      (4)   Sent by certified, preposted U.S. mail to the last known address;
      (5)   If the notice is attempted to be served by certified, preposted
U.S. mail and then returned showing that the letter was not delivered, or the
certified letter is not returned within fourteen (14) days after the date of
mailing, then notice may be sent by regular, preposted, first-class U.S.; or
      (6)   If the notice is attempted to be served by regular, first class
U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and the letter is then returned showing that the
letter was not delivered or is not returned within fourteen (14) days after the
date of mailing, then notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or about
the structure, building, premises or property affected by such notice.
   (e)   Applies to All Permittees. Chapter
1149 shall apply to all Permittees and all Permittees unless expressly
exempted.
   (f)   Police Powers. All Persons' rights are subject to the police powers of
the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety and
welfare of the public. All persons shall comply with all applicable Laws
enacted by the City pursuant to its police powers. In particular, all persons
shall comply with City zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the
placement and specifications of Facilities.
   (g)   Compliance. No Person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply
with any of the provisions of Chapter
1149 by reason of any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance.
   (h)   Force Majeure. In the event any Person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by Chapter
1149 is prevented by a cause or event not within such Person's control, such
inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions
shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes
or events not within the control of a Permittee shall include, without
limitation, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances,
failure or loss of, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters
such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires.
   (i)   No Warranty. The City makes no representation or warranty regarding
its right to authorize the Construction of Facilities on any particular Rights-
Of-Way. The burden and responsibility for making such determination shall be
upon the Person installing Facilities in the Rights-Of-Way.
   (j)   Captions. The captions and headings in this Chapter are for
convenience and reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Chapter. (Ord. 11-22. Passed 2-7-22.)
    1149.28 PENALTY.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this Chapter and the
remedy of specific performance which may be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction, the following penalties shall apply.
      (1)   For failure to comply with any other provision of this chapter, the
penalty shall be a civil forfeiture, payable to the City, in an amount up to
five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each day of violation. In addition,
for failure to timely comply with a notice by the Mayor or his designee to
remove or rearrange Facilities pursuant to Section
1149.06, an additional civil forfeiture equal to any costs incurred by the City
as a result of such failure, including but not limited to any penalties or
liquidated damages charged the City by its contractors occasioned thereby,
shall be imposed.

all delinquent Right-Of-Way Occupancy Permit fees. Delinquent Permit Fees may

      (3)    The parking space requirement for a use not specifically mentioned
herein shall be the same as required for a use of similar nature.
      (4)    Whenever a building or use constructed or established after the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance is changed or enlarged in floor area,
number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise,
to create a need for an increase of ten percent or more in the number of
existing parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the
enlargement or change.
         (Ord. 34-17. Passed 11-20-17.)
   1155.03 SPECIAL PARKING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    The parking of disabled vehicles within a residential district for a
period of more than one week shall be prohibited, except that such vehicles may
be stored in an enclosed garage or other accessory building, provided that no
business shall be conducted in connection therewith while such vehicles are
parked or stored.
   (b)    All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot
with the building or use served. Where possible, however, the required space
may be located not to exceed 500 feet away from the use being served.
   (c)    Not more than fifty percent of the parking spaces required for (1)
theaters, bowling alleys, dance halls, night clubs or cafes, and up to one
hundred percent of the parking spaces required for a church or school
auditorium, may be provided and used jointly by (2) banks, offices, retail
stores, repair shops, service establishments and similar uses not normally
open, used or operated during the same hours as those listed in (1), provided
however, that acceptable agreement thereto is made as specified in subsection
(d) hereof.
   (d)    In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the
same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively
or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their
retention for such purposes, shall be properly drawn and executed by the
parties concerned, approved as to form by the Solicitor and executed by Council
and shall be filed with the application for a building permit. Where written
agreements are not feasible, Council may make exceptions.
(Ord. 40-63. Passed 12-12-63.)
   1155.04 DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF PARKING AREAS.
   Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public, commercial or private
parking area shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements.
   (a)    Screening and Landscaping. Off-street parking areas for more than ten
vehicles shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces
premises situated in any "R" District, or institutional premises by a masonry
wall or solid fence of acceptable design. Such wall or fence shall be not less
than four feet or more than six feet in height and shall be maintained in good
condition without any advertising thereon. The space between such wall or fence
and the lot line of the adjoining premises in any "R" District shall be
landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs or evergreen ground cover and maintained in
good condition. In lieu of such wall or fence, a strip of land not less than
fifteen feet in width, and planted and maintained with an evergreen hedge or
dense planting of evergreen shrubs not less than four feet in height may be
substituted.
   (b)    Minimum Distance and Setbacks. No part of any parking area for more
than twenty vehicles shall be closer than twenty feet to any dwelling, school,
hospital or other institution for human care located on an adjoining lot,
unless screened by an unpierced masonry wall of acceptable design. If on the
same lot with a main building, the parking area shall not be located within the
front yard required for such building. In no case shall any part of a parking
area be closer than five feet to any established street or alley right of way.
The wall or hedge required in subsection (a) hereof shall be set back from each
street, the same as if it were a building wall, so as to observe the front yard
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    Surfacing. Any off-street parking area for more than ten vehicles
shall be graded for proper drainage and surfaced so as to provide a durable and
dustless surface, and shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for orderly
and safe parking and storage of vehicles. The foregoing surfacing requirements
shall not apply to a parking area in an "M" District if more than 200 feet
distant from any "R" District, except that a dustless surface shall be provided
in any case.
   (d)    Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises in
any "R" District.
      (Ord. 40-63. Passed 12-12-63; Ord. 02-08. Passed 2-18-08.)

   1322.01 REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Fences up to three feet in height are permitted in yards fronting on
the public street. The building line of the house foundation shall be
considered as the point from which a fence may extend toward a front property
line not to exceed three feet in height, and on a corner lot a fence shall not
protrude beyond the building line of a structure in a side yard in excess of
three feet. Fences in a front yard must stay a minimum of twelve inches back
from a sidewalk, if present. These same screening devices up to six feet in
height are permitted in the remaining yards. In the event that a request is
made to install a fence in excess of three feet on a corner lot that abuts a
rear alley, it shall be the discretion of the Building and Zoning Codes
Administrator to determine where the fence shall be located and at what height
it shall be allowed in order to create a reasonable visibility for vehicular
traffic where two right of ways intersect. No fence shall be permitted to be
erected in a City easement or in a right of way. Chain link fencing shall only
be permitted in the side and rear yards in residential districts. It's the
responsibility of the property owner to ensure that any fence is installed
within the confines of their property. In no case shall a fence prevent an
adjacent property owner from performing maintenance to any structure(s) on
their property. Fences shall present a finished side to the adjoining property,
which side shall not be adorned with signs, graphics or paintings of any kind.
Any fence that is installed in the City shall be suitable and designed for the
intended purpose by the manufacturer and shall not be made of makeshift
materials. Construction site or snow fences are permitted only on construction
sites during the period of work performed at that location. All fences erected
in the City of Dover require a twenty-five dollars ($25.00) zoning certificate
fee, accompanied by a drawing and filed with the City of Dover Building and
Zoning Administrator. (Ord. 41-22. Passed 9-6-22.)
   (b)   Any private swimming pool that is defined in Section
1143.09 Private Swimming Pools shall adhere to the fencing provision under
Section
1143.09(b)(3). The swimming pool, or the entire property on which it is
located, shall be walled or fenced to prevent uncontrolled access by young
children from the street or from adjacent properties. Such fence or wall shall
be not less than four feet in height and maintained in good condition, with a
gate and lock. Alternately, the swimming pool may be constructed or situated in
such a way that there is no less than a four foot barrier, deck, rigid side or
other construction that is equivalent to a fence or barrier that has a four
foot height.
   (c)   No person shall erect or maintain any fence charged with electric
current, or maintain a barbed wire fence which abuts or is adjacent to any
public street or sidewalk. Injurious materials such as barbed wire or spiked
fences are not permitted, except in the placement and use of not more than
three strands of barbed wire on top of a fence other than a barbed wire fence,
provided such strands are not less than seventy-two inches from the ground.
Such fence may only be located in a Commercial (B) or Industrial (M) zoned
district. Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
Penalty, see
501.99.
   (d)   Off-street parking areas for more than ten vehicles shall be
effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces premises situated in
any residential zoned district, or institutional premises by a masonry wall or
solid fence of acceptable design. Such wall or fence shall not be less than
four feet or more than six feet in height and shall be maintained in good
condition without any advertising thereon.
   (e)   Auto and metal salvage operations shall be effectively screened on all
sides by means of walls or fences. Walls or fences shall be a minimum of six
feet in height and a maximum of eight feet in height with no advertising
thereon and properly maintained. Fences are permitted to have barbed wire

   1331.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
    Regulation of signs will permit businesses in the City of Dover to
advertise and permit said advertisements to be consistently applied to enhance
the business and living environments in the City of Dover. Sign regulations,
including provisions that control the type, design, location, motion,
illumination, enforcement and maintenance thereof, will enhance the business
and living environments of the City of Dover. To achieve those goals, to
enhance the beauty of the City of Dover, and to further the City of Dover's
historical heritage as a beautiful and industrious city on the banks of the
Tuscarawas River, the following purposes are stated:
   (a)   Signs will be regulated to maintain high quality residential districts
and promote attractive public facilities by permitting only name plates,
bulletin boards (announcement signs that direct attention to public and semi-
public institutions) and identification signs related to the development of
such districts;
   (b)   Signs will be regulated to provide reasonable, yet appropriate
conditions for identifying establishments in business and industrial districts
by relating the size, type and design of signs to the type of the business or
industrial establishment;
   (c)   Signs will be regulated to eliminate any conflict between advertising
signs and traffic control signs which would be hazardous to the safety of the
motoring public or pedestrians;
   (d)   Signs will be regulated to control the design and size of all signs so
that the appearance will be aesthetically harmonious with the overall urban
design for the area; and
   (e)   Signs will be regulated to promote the most desirable development and
economic activity consistent with the objectives of the planning and
development of the City of Dover;
   (f)   The provisions in this chapter are established to provide a reasonable
and impartial method of regulating advertising, to insure safe construction, to
insure light, air and open space, to reduce hazards at intersections, and to
protect property values of the entire community and to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Dover.
      (Ord. 4-11. Passed 3-7-11.)
   1331.02 PERMITS AND SIGN MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   A sign permit shall be required for all signs. Permanent sign
applications shall be charged a fee of $50.00. Applications shall be made to
the Building and Zoning Codes Administrator. Each permit application shall
include a drawing to scale showing the dimensions of the building, colored
photographs of the existing or proposed buildings, size, design and layout of
the sign and illumination. Applicants for a sign within 660 feet of an
interstate or state primary highway shall also make application to the Ohio
Department of Transportation, advertising device control section or its
equivalent.
   (b)   All signs and the premises surrounding a sign shall be maintained in a
safe and inoffensive condition and be kept free and clear of weeds and rubbish.
If the Building and Zoning Codes Administrator finds the premises or the sign
not maintained as required herein, abandoned, or in a dilapidated condition,
written notice to remedy the condition shall be served by hand delivery or
ordinary mail to the last known business operator and the owner of the
premises, as well as any recorded lessee. The notice shall require the owner,
operator, lessee or any other person with an interest in the premises to remedy
the condition within ten days of the hand delivery or mailing of the notice. If
the owner, operator, lessee or other interest holder fails to comply, the City
of Dover may remedy the condition by any means deemed necessary, including but
not limited to, removal of the sign and all appurtenances thereto. The failure
to remove the sign is declared a nuisance. All costs associated with the remedy
of the condition shall be assessed against the owner, operator, lessee or any
other interest holder in the premises and shall further be placed as a lien
against the premises.
   (c)   Any permanent sign that is abandoned for 90 days, or if the business
closes for a period in excess of 90 days, shall be immediately removed by the
land owner, business operator, or lessee. The landowner, business operator or
lessee, shall remove any sign accessory to an abandoned use or lessee. If the
landowner, business operator or lessee fails to remove said sign, the Building
and Zoning Codes Administrator shall follow the procedures noted in subsection
(b) hereof. Seasonal businesses are exempt from this provision unless the
business has permanently ceased operation.
   (d)   Signs are prohibited on utility poles, hydrants, bridges, walls, trees
and foliage. Signage is prohibited off-site for any business, unless utilizing
an existing billboard. The use of trucks, trailers or semi-trailers, or job
site trucks, trailers or semi-trailers as an advertising device at any location
within the City is prohibited unless it is used as a temporary vehicle
necessary for an ongoing work project at that location. A period of 28 days
shall be considered a legitimate period for a determination that a truck,
trailer, or semi-trailer are considered an off-site job trailer. Additional
time may be granted by the Building and Zoning Codes Administrator due to
circumstances of an ongoing project.
   (e)   Pole or pylon signs exceeding seven feet in height that are supported
by or suspended from a freestanding column or columns, including billboards are
prohibited.
   (f)   Legal nonconforming signs shall be maintained or repaired to safe
condition. All legal nonconforming signs declared to be a nuisance by the
Building and Zoning Codes Administrator shall be removed or reconstructed in
compliance with the Zoning and Sign Codes.
   (g)   The affected property owner, business operator, or lessee may appeal
to the Board of Zoning Appeals or the Architectural Review Board any order of
the Building and Zoning Codes Administrator. (Ord. 20-17. Passed 5-15-17.)

considered in relation to their surroundings. They shall have continuity of
design if in a series on a building wall or walls.
      (6)   Style and color. Style and Color shall be consistent throughout a
particular building or group of buildings and limited to no more than four
colors in addition to white and black. Style and color should be compatible
with the building façade and be submitted to and approved by the Building and
Zoning Codes Administrator with a right to appeal to the Architectural Review
Board, if any, or the Board of Zoning Appeals. Graphics, materials and
structural design shall be considered.
      (7)   Building wall or nameplate. One wall or panel nameplate may be
placed on each building in a Business District. A nameplate may identify
service entrances to a retail business or lettering on a door on the building
not exceeding two square feet in sign face area. Manufacturing and warehouse
facilities shall be permitted a nameplate or wall plate not exceeding four
square feet.
      (8)   Theatre canopy signs. Theatre canopy signs shall have the size and
design characteristics determined by the Planning Commission.
      (9)   Service station island signs. Service station island signs are
permitted as are information signs at fuel pumps and other service islands and
are limited to information essential in directing and instructing the motoring
public. Number, area, height and design shall be determined by the Planning
Commission.
      (10)   Painted signs applied to a building exterior. Painted signage
applied to building surfaces is prohibited, with the exception of recreations
of historic painted signage on building surfaces, which shall be treated as
art. The Architectural Review Board is to have approval authority for art, such
as murals, as applied to building surfaces.
      (11)   Adult entertainment signs and exterior displays.  No adult
entertainment business shall erect signage or publicly displayed advertising in
any manner that permits the observation of any material depicting, describing,
or relating to sexual activities, by display, decorations, signs, show window,

   1335.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization City of Dover. Article XVIII, Section 3, of
the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land
use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Dover, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Dover has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard to protect property and minimize
future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Dover as identified in Section
1335.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of Dover.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Tuscarawas County, Ohio and incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas both effective July 22, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard
that through appropriate engineering analysis are scientifically reliable.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Dover as required by Section
1335.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments. Any revisions to the
aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared
a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on file at the office
the Dover Building and Zoning Codes Administrator, 122 East Third St., Dover,
Ohio 44622.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances, including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Dover, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared unconstitutional or invalid.

areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      A.   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      B.   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      C.   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      D.   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      E.   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
         Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity floodwaters, high potential for
debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Dover's historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and therefore, is excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Dover Flood
Insurance Rate Map on July 16, 1987, with all changes and additions to those
maps as modified and or as adopted in any subsequent ordinance and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (27)   Person.  Person includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 32-10. Passed 6-7-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Dover's flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1335.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1335.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1335.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1335.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Dover, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Dover have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Dover's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Dover's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Dover suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Dover has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1335.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided the applicant completes all of the
following:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1335.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Dover and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1335.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Dover specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1335.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 32-10. Passed 6-7-10.)
   1335.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Dover Council establishes the Dover Board of Zoning
Appeals as the Appeals Board to hear any appeals to the determination of the
Dover Floodplain Administrator. Each member shall serve until his/her successor
is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
office of the Dover Building and Zoning Codes Administrator.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1335.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within twenty (20) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by an
application fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) for the first ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) of estimated cost of the project plus an additional
ten dollars ($10.00) for each additional ten thousand dollars ($10,000) of
estimated cost up to a maximum of five hundred dollars ($500.00). If an
engineering evaluation or opinion is needed by the City of Dover or by the
Appeals Board to evaluate the Application, then the Applicant shall be
responsible for all costs incurred by the City of Dover to obtain said
evaluation or opinion. The evaluation and opinion shall include all the factors
listed in this chapter and particularly subsection (d)(3) and (4).
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing, the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1335.05(d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Tuscarawas Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 32-10. Passed 6-7-10.)

   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a program for identifying and
registering vacant residential and commercial buildings and structures; to
determine the responsibilities of the owners of vacant buildings and
structures; to preserve and protect the City of Dover's residential and
commercial districts from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate
maintenance; and to speed the rehabilitation of the vacant buildings and
structures. The City of Dover finds that the presence of properties exhibiting
evidence of vacancy pose special risks to the health, safety, and welfare of
the community and therefore require heightened regulatory attention. Shifting
the cost of burden from the general citizenry to the owners of the vacant
buildings and structures will be the result of this chapter.

of an ownership interest, the new owner(s) will not be required to pay for re-
registering the property until such time that the registration fee is due based
on the original date of vacancy. This does not mean they do not have to
register within ninety (90) days as specified above.

   1501.01 ADOPTION.
   (a)   The Ohio Fire Code, as adopted through the provisions of the Ohio
Administrative Code (as presently adopted and subsequently amended pursuant to
the rule making provisions of the Ohio Administrative Code, the Ohio Department
of Commerce and the Ohio Fire Marshall) and as published through Ohio
Administrative Code Section 1301:7-7 and as published at http://
www.com.state.ohio.us/sfm/ is adopted as the fire code for the City of Dover,
Ohio.
   (b)   For any construction in the City of Dover requiring plan approval by
the East Central Ohio Building Authority (ECOBA), plans must be first submitted
to the Dover Fire Department for review purposes to insure that the provisions
of this chapter and the Ohio Fire Code are adequately addressed. The Dover Fire
Chief shall have authority to issue a stop work order if plans have not been
submitted for review and significant fire code issues are not properly
addressed.
   (c)   All commercial or institutional properties shall obtain and install a
key vault compatible with the key vaults currently in use throughout the City
of Dover and keyed to match the Dover Fire Department’s access key(s).
   (d)   All sprinkler or standpipe Siamese connections shall be equipped with
a 5" Storz hose connection (as opposed to a double 2 & 1/2 connection with WYE)
attached to a drop down elbow designed to provide relief to attached hose and
reduce kinking.
   (e)   If any business or institution equipped with a fire alarm experiences
three or more false alarms within any thirty consecutive days and is unable to
provide evidence of appropriate attempts to rectify the problems that may exist
within the system, the Fire Chief may assess a fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00) for the first occurrence. For each subsequent occurrence (three or
more false alarms within 30 consecutive days that occurs within the following
two years after the first occurrence), the Fire Chief may assess a fine of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) and the additional assessment of the cost of
dispatching a fire squad assessed at one thousand dollars ($1,000). The Fire
Chief shall determine whether the business or institution has appropriately
attempted to rectify the problems within the system.
   (f)   The Fire Chief shall have the authority to institute a building
labeling system for businesses, institutions, any building with three or more
apartments that was not originally designed as an apartment building and any
mixed-use building with any number of residential living quarters. The building
labeling system shall be instituted for the purposes of the safety of the
citizens of the City of Dover, its firefighters, and the public at large within
the City of Dover and any additional area served by the Dover Fire Department
(presently Dover Township). The authority to institute this building labeling
system does not create any duty on the Fire Department either to implement the
system or to actually label any building. No liability shall be assessed
against the City of Dover, the Dover fire department or any of its officers
because of the implementation of the system, the posting of labels or the
failure to post labels. The Fire Chief shall have authority to create labeling
categories necessary to insure the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the City of Dover and to insure fire safety of the public and fire fighters.
Included in the building labeling system shall be truss floors or roofs, metal
deck roof, notations of significant alterations from the original design or
structural affects caused by alteration, deterioration, erosion, subsidence, or
shifting, the number of apartments, the access doors at street level for
apartments.
 
   (g)   The labels shall be 3" x 3" red and white reflective material and
shall be placed where designated by the Fire Chief. The City of Dover will
provide the labels and shall have the authority to both label and to remove
labels. This ordinance does not create any duty on the landowner or landlord to
label its buildings. The Fire Department shall label buildings, only as time,
opportunity, need and priorities of resources allow.
   (h)   To the extent allowed by the Ohio Fire Code, all appeals of fire code
decisions or orders shall be heard by the Dover Ohio Fire Code Appeals Board.
The Board shall be appointed by the Mayor of the City of Dover and shall
consist of three members with fire fighting or fire training experience or
commercial building experience. In the event that a party is aggrieved by the
decision of the Dover Ohio Fire Code Appeals Board, the party shall have the
right to appeal to the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas on an abuse of
discretion standard. The initial Board shall be appointed with one person
having a one-year term, one person having a two-year term, and one person
having a three-year term. After the initial appointment, each person shall
thereafter be appointed for a three-year term.
