AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, a determination has been made that the ordinances of the City of

   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before

enacted prior to September 1, 1992, which are inconsistent with any provision
of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of
this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

ordinances of the Municipality as codified therein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of the City of Findlay, Ohio, 1992.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Findlay Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Findlay Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or

      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (a)     On all qualifying salaries, wages, commissions and other

subsection, real property includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer,
and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual

period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their

services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (2)    In the event the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
to produce that result.
      (3)    As used in subsection (h)(1) hereof, "sales made in the City"
means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within the City.
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within

point outside the City, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City, and the
sales result from that solicitation or promotion.
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside the City, regardless of where title
passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
   (i)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to the effective date of this section as allocable to the City may

allocable to the City until exhausted, but in no event for more than five
taxable years. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against
net profits of any prior year.
   (j)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
   (k)    On all third party sick pay earned or received on and after January
1, 2013, by resident individuals of the City or by nonresident individuals who
receive such payments as a result of their employment within the corporate
limits of the City.

agency.
      (Ord. 2012-101. Passed 12-18-12.)
 
193.04 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (a)   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to salaries,
wages, commissions and other compensation earned or received on and after
January 1, 2013, and with respect to the net profit of businesses, professions
and other activities earned or received on and after January 1, 2013. However,
where the fiscal year of the businesses, professions or other activity differs
from the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to that part of the net
profits for the fiscal year as shall be earned or received on and after January
1, 2013, to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year basis.
 
   (b)    If by operation of law, the commencement date for the levy,
collection and payment of the tax provided for by this chapter is postponed,

(Ord. 2012-101. Passed 12-18-12.)
193.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT.
   (a)    Each taxpayer whose earnings or profits are subject to the tax
imposed by this chapter shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, on or
before April 15, 2014, and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter, make
and file a final return with the Tax Administrator on a form obtainable from
the Tax Administrator, setting forth the aggregate amount of gross salary,
wages or other compensation, and gross and net profits earned or received by
the taxpayer during the preceding year or period and subject to the tax,
together with other pertinent information as the Tax Administrator may require.
However, when the final return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be made within 105 days from
the end of the fiscal year or other period.
   (b)    The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed on the
earnings and profits. The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the
filing thereof, however, pay to the City Treasurer the amount of taxes shown as
due thereon. However, where any portion of the tax has been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of this section and Section
193.06, credit for the amount paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to
be due, and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the final return.
   (c)   On written request by the taxpayer made on or before the original due
date for filing the annual income tax return, the Tax Administrator may extend
the time for filing the annual return for a period no earlier than the period
specified in Section 718.05 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (d)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, the taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the tax based on the
final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown
due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (e)    Where an employee's entire earnings for the tax period are paid by an
employer or employers, and the one percent (1%) tax thereon has in each
instance been withheld and deducted by the employer or employers from the
taxable amount of the entire earnings of such employee-taxpayer, and where the
employer of such employee has filed a return or returns in which such
employee's entire and only earnings are reported to the Administrator, and
where such employee has no taxable income other than such earnings and the tax
so withheld has been paid to the Administrator, the Administrator is hereby
authorized to accept such report or returns provided by the employer, unless
otherwise specified, as the return required of any such employee.
(Ord. 2012-101. Passed 12-18-12.)
193.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or conducting business within the City who
employs one or persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation
basis, excluding exempted incomes set forth in Section
193.14 and Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code, shall deduct at the time of
this payment of salary, wage, commission or other compensation, the tax levied
under Section
193.03 of:
(Ord. 2009-109. Passed 12-15-09.)
      (1)   All qualifying salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation
of employees who are residents of the City; and
      (2)   That part of qualifying salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation paid for services rendered within the City by employees who are
not residents of the City.
   (b)   Each employer shall, unless otherwise provided, within thirty days
following the close of the calendar quarter, make a return and pay to the Tax
Administrator the amount of taxes deducted.
   (c)   The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not the taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (d)   The return shall be on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The
employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same as trustee
for the benefit of the City until payment is made by the employer to the City,
and any tax collected by the employer from his employees shall, until the same
is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of the employer.
However, no person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid to domestic servants employed exclusively in or about the
person's residence. If a resident of the City receives salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation which are subject to withholding tax imposed
by a municipality other than Findlay, the employer may reduce the tax to be
withheld and paid to the City by the amount of tax withheld and paid to the
other municipality.

estimated profit from the business activity, with the estimated tax due

Administrator and within the time provided in Section
193.11.

Administrator and within the time prescribed in Section

of the taxpayer and shall issue a statement of said estimate to the taxpayer.

a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax

194.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition

      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or Section 1231 of the
Internal Revenue Code;
      (D)   (I)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating
loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than five
consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was
incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be
fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible
expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and

194.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
194.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE: WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
194.052  of this Chapter or division (D) or division (F) of this section. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or division (B)(1)(c) of this section
of taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to
the Tax Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following
the end of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399) or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200). Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall
be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than
fifteen days after the last day of each month.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
         (d)   The Tax Administrator may require an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer to make payment by electronic funds transfer to the
Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee
for remittance to the Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer is required to make payments electronically for the purpose of
paying federal taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of
the Internal Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or
regulation. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division
does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any
return as required under this section. Unless otherwise authorized by the Tax
Administrator, once the threshold for remitting payment electronically for
federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income tax withheld from
employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality shall be remitted to
the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax withholding payment is
due.
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires every resident individual
taxpayer to file a tax return under Section
194.091  of this Chapter.
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file with the Tax Administrator, in the form, manner, and method prescribed by
the Tax Administrator, a Withholding Reconciliation Return listing the names,
addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose qualifying
wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the Municipality during
the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such
employee's qualifying wages, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such
employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of every other municipal
corporation for which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such
employee during the preceding calendar year, any other information required for
federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or
its equivalent form with respect to such employee, and other information as may
be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (L)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by the
Ordinance is withheld from an employee's wages, such excess may be refunded by
the employer or the Tax Administrator, depending on the circumstances and the
time when the over-withholding is determined as follows:
      (1)   Current employees:
         (a)   If the over-withholding is discovered in the same period the
employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly with the employee and the
amount to be reported on the return as withheld shall be the corrected amount;
         (b)   If the over-withholding is discovered in a subsequent period of
the same calendar year the employer may make proper adjustment with the
employee. In such case the return for the period in which the adjustment is
made shall indicate the total amount actually withheld, the amount of the
adjustment deducted therefrom, and the corrected amount reported on the return;
         (c)   If the over-withholding is discovered in the following year, the
employer should notify the Tax Administrator of such over-withholding and the
circumstances thereof. Upon proper verification provided by the employer in
accordance with this section and upon proper verification provided by a return
filed by the employee under Section
194.09  of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall refund to the employee the
amount of such excess withholding, provided no other tax is due by the employee
for the year or for any other year or account for which the employee is
responsible for the tax and no other tax returns are delinquent or unfiled.
            (i)   The employer is not authorized to issue a refund to the
employee.
      (2)   Former employees:
         (a)   In case too much has been withheld from an employee, if the
error is discovered by the employee, such employee shall file a claim with the
Tax Administrator, and, upon verification thereof by the employer, the Tax
Administrator shall refund to the employee the amount of such excess
withholding provided no other tax is due by the employee for the year or for
any other year or account for which the employee is responsible for the tax and
no other tax returns are delinquent or unfiled.
      (3)   Non-residents employed outside the Municipality:
         (a)   Where an employer has withheld the tax from all wages of a non-
resident of Findlay and such non-resident has been employed outside of Findlay
for all or part of the time, such employee shall file a claim with the Tax
Administrator covering such erroneous withholding and the Tax Administrator
shall, upon verification thereof by the employer, refund to the employee the
amount of such excess withholding provided no other tax is due by the employee
for the year or for any other year or account for which the employee is
responsible for the tax and no other tax returns are delinquent or unfiled.
      (4)   Insufficient withholding:
         (a)   If less than the amount of tax required to be deducted is
withheld from an employee, such deficiency shall be withheld from subsequent
wages. However, if the employee-employer relationship has terminated, the
employer shall notify the Tax Administrator of such deficiency and the reason
therefor.
            (i)   Unless otherwise prohibited by provisions in Chapter 718 of
the Ohio Revised Code (Substitute House Bill 5, 130th Ohio General Assembly),
and in accordance with the provisions of this section, the employer may be held
liable for the insufficient withholding.

employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
194.03  of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, the Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Division (B)(1) and division (D) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
194.051  of this Chapter.
   (G)   Intentionally left blank.

194.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE: CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Section
3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales agent
conducting video lottery terminal sales on behalf of the state to withhold and
remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages
as provided in this section.
   (B)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by Section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and Social Security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or Social Security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent (50%) of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in Section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
194.07  of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

194.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
194.03 (23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
194.03 (1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
194.03 (11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in Section
194.0621 and division (B) of
194.062, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used
in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
194.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
194.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
194.19  of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and the
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or division (C)(2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in Section
194.0621, receipts from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be
sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides. A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
194.081  of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
194.03  of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This
division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount
of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation
under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

194.0621 ALTERNATIVE NET PROFITS APPORTIONMENT FOR REMOTE EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
         (a)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.    
         (b)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services for
the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
      (2)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer_
         "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
      (3)   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
         (a)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
         (b)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer or
client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under section 718.03 of the Revised Code on qualifying wages paid to an
employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
      (4)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
         (a)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
         (b)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (A)(4)(a) of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
         (c)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (A)(4)(a) or (b) of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
   (B)    A taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this section to the
apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers
that make this election, the provisions of section 718.02 of the Revised Code
apply to such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this section. A
taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this section in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election. The
taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this section, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location. After the taxpayer
makes the initial election, the election applies to every municipal corporation
in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer shall not be required to
file a net profit return with a municipal corporation solely because a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located in such municipal corporation. Nothing in this section prohibits a
taxpayer from making a new election under this section after properly revoking
a prior election.
   (C)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A)
of section 718.02 of the Revised Code, all of the following apply to a taxpayer
that has made the election described in division (8) of this section:
      (1)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of section 718.02 of the
Revised Code, the average original cost of any tangible personal property used
by a qualifying remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote
work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
      (2)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of section 718.02 of the
Revised Code, any wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (3)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of section 718.02 of the
Revised Code, and notwithstanding division (D) of that section, any gross
receipts of the business or profession from services performed during the
taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
   (D)    Nothing in this section prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a tax
administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or a
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of section 718.02 of the Revised Code. However, a tax
administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a
manner that it would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a
municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's
qualifying remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
   (E)    Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section
is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages pursuant to
sections 718.011 and 718.03 of the Revised Code. (Ord. 2023-114. Passed 11-21-
23.)
194.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.

defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or division (B)(2) of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
Regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (E)(3), and
(E)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
194.03 (1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of Section
194.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
194.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
194.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200).
For the purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
194.091  of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the

      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in divisions (C)(1)
(a) through (C)(1)(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
194.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar-year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal-year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
194.10  of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
194.091  of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

   (F)   The Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayer after finding that the
waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator shall not waive the estimate payment
requirements established herein, except as allowed by written policy approved
by the Income Tax Board and Council.
      (2)   Taxpayers granted permission to waive the requirement established
herein shall resume the estimate payment requirements beginning with tax year
2020. For tax year 2019, said taxpayers shall make an extension payment for the
entire year as of the original due date prescribed in Section
194.09.

   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Sections 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same
extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who
are employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
194.081  of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
194.096  of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
194.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
194.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires the Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
194.081  of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

shown to be due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
194.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
194.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
194.092  of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under divisions (F)(3) and (F)(4) of
this section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or division (B)(1)(c) of Section
194.051  of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
194.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
194.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), division (B), or division
(C) of this section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2)
and (B)(3) or division (B)(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the
spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is
married filing jointly for that year.
(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of
a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income
tax return for a taxpayer that is an individual shall be the fifteenth day of
the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return
relates. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return for a
taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's income tax return. If the request is received by the Tax
Administrator on or before the date the tax return is due, the Tax
Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under paragraph(A), (B), (C), (D) or (E) of this section, the
tax administrator shall not make any
inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or
before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due
date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
   (G)    If a tax administrator violates paragraph (F) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars.
Paragraph (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
paragraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this section if the tax administrator has actual
knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required
to receive the extension under paragraph (A) of this section or failed to file
for an extension under paragraph (C) of this section. (Ord. 2015-101. Passed
12-15-15; Ord. 2023-114. Passed 11-21-23.)
194.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
194.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
194.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
194.10  of this Chapter.
   (E)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
194.10  of this Chapter.
   (F)   Unless otherwise prohibited by provisions in Chapter 718 of the Ohio
Revised Code (Substitute House Bill 5, 130th Ohio General Assembly), the Tax
Administrator is authorized to withhold a refund request and transfer the
overpayment to any tax year for which there is any tax due or any return due by
the taxpayer for any year or account for which the taxpayer is responsible or
liable.
   (G)   Unless otherwise prohibited by provisions in Chapter 718 of the Ohio
Revised Code (Substitute House Bill 5, 130th Ohio General Assembly), taxes
erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for a refund is made in
accordance with the filing requirements specified in Sections
194.05  and
194.09  of this Chapter.

which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A
taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an
audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

computations, assessments, or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the
Tax Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

of this Chapter.
      (1)   This authorization extends for those municipalities for which this
Municipality administers the income tax.
   (K)   Under the supervision and control of the Director of Law, the Tax
Administrator, or his duly authorized agent, is hereby empowered and authorized

      (1)   This authorization extends for those municipalities for which this
Municipality administers the income tax.
         (Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;

(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that the Tax Administrator believes is subject
to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (E)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return, has failed
to provide sufficient records for a proper return to be filed, or whenever the
Administrator has been unable to secure information from the taxpayer as to the
taxable income for any year or period for which the prescribed filing deadline
has passed, the Tax Administrator, or his duly authorized agent, may determine
or estimate the amount of tax due the Municipality from the taxpayer, and shall
send to the taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined or estimated, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any,
in accordance with Sections
194.131 ,
194.133 ,
194.17 , and
194.18  of this Chapter and Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (1)    Such determination of tax and applicable penalties and interest
may be adjusted upon submission by the taxpayer of actual records from which
the tax may be computed.
         (Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's Social Security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
194.10  of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
194.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
194.10  of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
194.99  of this Chapter for a violation of
194.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio Revised Code 718 or
by the charter or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio
Revised Code 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may furnish all necessary taxpayer
information to the firm, legal office, attorney, or agency to which the Tax
Administrator has assigned taxpayers' accounts for past-due collection,
including, but not limited to copies of taxpayers' municipal returns, bills,
statements, reports, affidavits, account summaries, transaction histories,
Social Security numbers, and federal identification numbers.
         (a)   The firm, legal office, attorney, or agency to which the Tax
Administrator has assigned taxpayers' accounts for past-due collection is
subject to the provisions of this section and to the provisions of Section
718.13 of the Ohio Revised Code in their entirety.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
194.15  of this Chapter.
   (E)   If the Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds the Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   The Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has

involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-101. Passed 12-15-15.)
194.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Chapter 718 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,

preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be

administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.

legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in Section 718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall be appointed to or
serve on another such board simultaneously.
      (10)   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be
domiciled in the Municipality.
      (11)   The members of the Local Board of Tax Review shall hear appeals on
behalf of any municipality for which this Municipality administers the income
tax.
   (B)   Whenever the Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
194.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or

   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
194.18  of this Chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
194.096  of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been

195.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy an excise tax of three percent (3%)
on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests, as authorized and permitted by Ohio R.C. 5739.02(C).
Accordingly, this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and to
be consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a
prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied.
(1979 Code 99.01)
195.02 PURPOSE.
   There shall be levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging by a
hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests of three percent (3%) of the
amount paid or to be paid by the transient guests for the lodging for the
purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs of the City.
(1979 Code 99.02)
195.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   "Administrator" means the City Auditor.
   (b)   "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (c)   "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty days.
   (d)   "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel
and who furnishes the lodging.
      (1979 Code 99.03)
195.04 APPLICATION OF TAX.
   The tax shall be known as the transient guest tax. It applies and is
collectible at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time when
the price is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or
any of its political subdivisions. For the purpose of the proper administration
of this chapter and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all
lodging furnished by hotels in the City to transient guests is subject to the
tax until the contrary is established.
(1979 Code 99.04)
195.05 ADOPTION OF RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Administrator shall have power to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the transient guest tax.
(1979 Code 99.05)
195.06 TAX COLLECTION; EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   The transient guest tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the
transient guest to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient
guest the full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. The
tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held in
trust by the vendor until paid to the Administrator, as provided in Section
195.09. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the vendor, the
Administrator may require that the tax be paid directly to the Administrator.
 
   (b)   No exemption shall be granted except on a claim therefor made at the
time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury on a form prescribed by the
Administrator.
(1979 Code 99.06)
195.07 RECORDS.
   The transient occupancy tax shall be stated and charged separately from the
charge for the lodging and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time
when the occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and on every
evidence of occupancy issued or delivered by the vendor.
(1979 Code 99.07)
195.08 LIMITATIONS ON TAX REDUCTIONS.
   No vendor shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
vendor, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging, or
that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(1979 Code 99.08)
195.09 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of the month, make and
file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the
Administrator, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax
due from the vendor to the City for the period covered by the return, and any
other information the Administrator deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. The Administrator may extend the time for
making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing them
to the Administrator, together with payment of the full amount of tax shown to
be due thereon.
 
   (b)   The Administrator may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not
such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Administrator on the
basis of administrative costs of the City, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals. This authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
 
   (c)   All claims for exemption from tax filed by transient guests with the
vendor during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
 
   (d)   All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by the Administrator and shall not be released by him except on
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County or the City, for official use only.
 
   (e)   The Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to
be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the
vendor or his authorized agent.
(1979 Code 99.09)
195.10 REFUNDS.
   The Administrator shall refund or grant credits to vendors for the amount of
taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous
assessment where the vendor had not reimbursed himself from the transient
guest. A transient guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount of taxes
paid illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was paid by the transient
guest directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid unless the
claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement
and makes a claim in writing on forms furnished by the Administrator, stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds on which the claim is founded.
The claim shall be filed with the Administrator within three years of the date
of payment.
(1979 Code 99.10)
195.11 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX.
   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient guest tax or to file
a return to make a remittance of the tax or any portion thereof, as required by
this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in the manner he may deem best to
obtain information on which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any vendor who has failed or refused to collect the tax,
or to file a return and to make a remittance of the proper amount thereof. The
Administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against the vendor the tax
and penalty provided for in this chapter.
(1979 Code 99.11)
195.12 HEARINGS.
   (a)   In case a determination as provided for in Section
195.11 is made, the Administrator shall give notice of the amount so assessed
by serving it personally or by registered or certified mail. The vendor may
within ten days after the serving or mailing of the notice, make application in
writing to the Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If
application by the vendor is not made within the time prescribed, the tax and
penalty determined by the Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable.
 
   (b)   If the application is made, the Administrator shall give not less than
five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the
vendor to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount
specified therein should not be fixed for the tax and penalty. At this hearing,
the vendor may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax and penalty
should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the Administrator shall determine
the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
person in the manner prescribed in this section of the determination and the
amount of the tax and penalty. The amount determined to be due shall be payable
after fifteen days.
(1979 Code 99.12)
195.13 APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling or determination of the Administrator with respect
to the amount of the tax and penalty shall be made as provided by law.
(1979 Code 99.13)
195.14 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.

(Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.02 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
 196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in
a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Ohio Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the
Ohio Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control.
Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws
of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in
both this section and Chapter
194.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in sections
196.02 to
196.16 of this Chapter.
   As used in sections
196.02 to
196.16 of this Chapter only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section 196.03, as applicable, reduced by any pre-
2017 net operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code and
Chapter
194.03, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)    (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
196.07 of this Chapter.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (L)(2) of section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the
election described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Ohio Revised
Code, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this
section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and
other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use
of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal
Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to
a qualified selfemployed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the
taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Ohio Revised
Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy
when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
      (1)    Unless otherwise prohibited by provisions of Chapter 718 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a single member limited liability company that is a
disregarded entity for federal tax purposes may be a separate taxpayer from its
single member in all Ohio municipal corporations in which it either filed as a
separate taxpayer or did not file for its taxable year ending in 2003, if all
of the following conditions are met:
      (2)    The limited liability company's single member is also a limited
liability company
      (3)    The limited liability company and its single member were formed
and doing business in one or more Ohio municipal corporations for at least five
years before January 1, 2004.

section existed on December 31, 2004.
      (5)    The limited liability company was not formed for the purpose of
evading or reducing Ohio municipal corporation income tax liability of the
limited liability company or its single member.
      (6)    The Ohio municipal corporation that was the primary place of
business of the sole member of the limited liability company consented to the
election.
      (7)    For purposes of division (47)(B)(i)(e) of Chapter
194, a municipal corporation was the primary place of business of a limited
liability company if, for the limited liability company's taxable year ending
in 2003, its income tax liability was greater in that municipal corporation
than in any other municipal corporation in Ohio, and that tax liability to that
municipal corporation for its taxable year ending in 2003 was at least four
hundred thousand dollars ($400,000).
      (8)    This Municipality hereby consents to such election as required in
division (47)(B)(i)(e) of Chapter

   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and
includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation
of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax
commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year
for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax
purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal
income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new
taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
 196.11 of this Chapter.
      (Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)

performed in the City of Findlay to wages, salaries, and other compensation
paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or

718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City of
Findlay to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)    (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City of Findlay, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;

      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
196.11 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
196.11 of this Chapter.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, courtmartial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of
Findlay as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City of Findlay only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:

Findlay from a stock of goods located within the City of Findlay.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the City of Findlay from a

engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City of Findlay and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.

City of Findlay to the extent that such services are performed in the City of

property shall be sitused to the City of Findlay based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the City of Findlay.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of Findlay
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to the City of Findlay based upon the ratio
of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate located in the City of Findlay to the commissions received
from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable
year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Chapter
194, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Findlay. In no case
shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to
the City of Findlay any amount other than the amount upon which the employee
would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not
exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Findlay
under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)

municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be

commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under

      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section

(B)(1) or (2) of Chapter
194.063 is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
196.01 of this Chapter is terminated, a valid election made under this section
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section

division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
196.02 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
196.03 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
196.03 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
196.03 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
196.03 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under sections
196.01 to
 196.16 of this Chapter or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group. (Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.08 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
196.01 of this Chapter fails to pay any tax as required under sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date prescribed
for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued
under section
196.11 of this Chapter, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.09 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)    (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (D)    (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there
shall be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code upon the amount of
underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to
reasonable cause as described in division (E) of this section. The amount of
the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
196.01 to
 196.16 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year. (Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.10 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter or Chapter 5703. of the Ohio Revised Code, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing
between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on
which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this
division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
 196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
196.01 of this Chapter fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid
under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen per
cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
 196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on
the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
196.12 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed
under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund
from the date of the refund, may be assessed under section
196.11 of this Chapter without regard to any time limitation for the assessment
imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
196.01 to
 196.16 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section 718.83 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.11 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under sections
 196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
 196.12 of this Chapter for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or
limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject
to assessment as required by sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in section 5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner
shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a
hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Ohio Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until
the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Ohio Revised Code, whichever comes
first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney
general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Ohio Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the
clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the
taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division
(B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the
assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the
commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
196.12 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by that
section.
(Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.12 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
 196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (A) of section
196.11 of this Chapter. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed
by the tax commissioner.
   
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Ohio Revised Code. If the amount is greater
than ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day
the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 2018-014. Passed
2-20-18.)
196.13 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
196.01 of this Chapter and used to determine the tax due under sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
196.11 of this Chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due
under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The
amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
196.12 of this Chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
196.12 of this Chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.14 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
196.01 to
196.16 of this Chapter shall be open to the tax commissioner's inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The commissioner may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is
liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a
municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.15 CREDITS.
   (A)    A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the City of Findlay
pursuant to Chapter
194.064 to
 194.065, shall be available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
196.01 of this Chapter, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A
municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the tax
commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-first

   (B)    (1)    Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the City of Findlay granting the
credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount
of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the
credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City of Findlay and taxpayer under Chapter
194.064 to
194.065, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.
         (Ord. 2018-014. Passed 2-20-18.)
196.16 RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
   (A)    Except as provided in division (B) of this section, whoever

imprisonment for a term of up to six months, or both.
   (B)    Each instance of access or disclosure in violation of division (A) of
section
 196.04 of this Chapter constitutes a separate offense.
   
   (C)    These specific penalties shall not be construed to prevent the City
of Findlay from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may apply.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.

but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to

thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear

compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and

   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and
to determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty- day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
 
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
 
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
 
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
 
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
 
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
 
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
 501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

(1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to its
former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable cost
of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

705.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "The Findlay Cablevision
Franchise Procedure and Standards Chapter."
(1979 Code 115.01)
705.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (a)   "Cable television system" (sometimes referred to as a "CATV system" or
"system") means a communications system of coaxial cables or other electrical
conductors, equipment and appurtenances which is capable of receiving,
transmitting and distributing sounds, pictures, writings, data, signals and
other intelligence by electrical impulses, but which is used primarily to
receive television or radio signals directly or indirectly off the air, and
transmit them to subscribers for a fee.
   (b)   "Company" means the cable television franchise applicant selected by
Council as franchisee, as well as the franchisee's successors and assigns.
      (1979 Code 115.02)
705.03 NATURE OF GRANT.
   The City is authorized to select a cable television franchisee who will be
granted the nonexclusive right and privilege to construct, erect, operate and
maintain, in, under, on, along, across, above and over the streets, alleys,
highways, lanes, avenues, sidewalks, bridges, boulevards, public ways or other
public places now laid out or dedicated, and all extensions thereof and
additions thereto, in the City, a cable television system, and grant the right
to use and occupy such streets, alleys and public ways and places to any person
at any time during the period of this franchise.
(1979 Code 115.03)
705.04 AREA SERVICED.
   Any company franchised hereunder shall extend cable television service
throughout the incorporated area of the City at the date of the franchise
grant, in an equitable and reasonable manner so that all parts of the community
are offered the same CATV servicing opportunity. On the annexation of any
territory to the City, the portion of the system that is located or operated
within such territory and on the streets, alleys or public grounds thereof
shall thereafter be subject to all the terms of this chapter as though it were
an extension of the grant made thereunder.
(1979 Code 115.04)
705.05 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND ORDINANCES.
   The City shall retain the right, at all times during the term of any
franchise granted hereunder, to reasonably exercise its police powers over the
franchisee by means of administrative or legislative action. The company shall
comply with all rules and regulations of all appropriate state and federal
agencies of competent jurisdictions, and particularly those of the Federal
Communications Commission. Any revision or modification adopted by the FCC
which would otherwise not be applicable to an existing franchise agreement made
pursuant to this chapter shall nevertheless automatically be incorporated into
such franchise agreement, and made effective one year after the revisions or
modification is adopted by the FCC.
(1979 Code 115.05)
705.06 LIABILITY.
   Any company franchised hereunder shall, at all times, save the City harmless
from and against any and all damages, claims and demands for injury to person
or property which may be made against the City in any manner growing out of the
installation, construction, maintenance and operation, or any one or any
combination of these, of such system or any equipment of the company, and in
case suit is filed against the City, either independently or jointly with the
company to recover for any claim or damages, such company, on notice to it by
the City, shall defend the City against the action, and, in the event of a
final judgment being obtained against the City, either independently or jointly
with the company on account solely of the acts of the company, the company
shall pay such judgment and all costs, and hold the City harmless therefrom.
(1979 Code 115.06)
705.07 INSURANCE.
   Any company franchised hereunder shall carry insurance to protect the City
and the franchisee from and against all claims, demands, actions, judgments,
costs, expenses and liabilities which may arise or result, directly or
indirectly, from or by reason of, such loss, injury or damage. The amount of
such insurance against liability due to physical damages to property shall not
be less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) as to any one accident and
not less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) aggregate in any single
policy year; and against liability due to bodily injury or to death of persons,
not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) as to any one person and
not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) as to any one accident.
All policies shall be maintained and in effect for the entire life of any
franchise term. Such policy or policies of insurance shall be approved by the
Service-Safety Director of the City and certificates of such insurance, along
with written evidence of payment of required premiums, and shall be filed and
maintained with the Service-Safety Director.
(1979 Code 115.07)
705.08 SERVICE STANDARDS.
   Any company franchised hereunder shall maintain and operate its system and
render efficient service in accordance with the rules and regulations as set
forth by this chapter, any amendments thereto, and the terms of the company's
franchise agreement with the City.
   (a)   Notice of interruption for repairs. Whenever it is necessary to shut
off or interrupt service for the purpose of making repairs, adjustments or
installations, the company shall do so at such time as will cause the least
amount of inconvenience to its customers, and unless such interruption is
unforeseen or immediately necessary, it shall give reasonable notice thereof to
its customers.
   (b)   At the beginning of any original franchise term or renewal term, the
franchisee shall meet as minimum technical standards those standards required
by the FCC of applicants for a new system. If such minimum technical standards
for new systems are changed during the term of the franchise, the franchisee
may be required, on eighteen months' notice, to comply with the new minimum
standards for applicants for new systems, provided that in no event shall such
compliance be required in less than three years after such change. By this, the
City intends that its franchisee will be no more than three years
technologically outdated.
   (c)   The franchisee shall provide no less than the number of signals and
carriages presently being devoted to rebroadcast and relay of TV signals, the
present number being fifteen signals carried over twelve channels.
   (d)   After providing eighteen months' notice, the City may at any time
require a company to furnish additional channel capacity and special channels
for public access, educational and governmental use, but not in excess of the
capacity required by FCC rules and regulations for a community located in one
of the first 100 major television markets as defined by the FCC.
   (e)   A franchisee shall exercise care in the installation and maintenance
of its equipment such that no interference is caused to existing communications
systems, and so as not to distort or interfere with direct off-the-air
television signals.
      (1979 Code 115.08)
705.09 COMPANY RULES.
   (a)   Any company franchised hereunder shall have the authority to
promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct
of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the company to
exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this chapter, and to
assure an uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers. However, such
rules, regulations, term and conditions shall not be in conflict with the
provisions hereof or of laws of the State or any federal law or regulation.
Such rules shall specifically cover delinquency and discontinuance of service.
   (b)   Copies of all such rules, rate schedules and other charges shall be
made available to the public at the company's office in the City.
(1979 Code 115.09)
705.10 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   Any company granted a franchise hereunder shall promptly accomplish
significant construction within one year after receiving its certificate of
compliance from the FCC. Construction and maintenance of the transmission
distribution system shall be in accordance with the provisions of the National
Electrical Safety Code of the National Fire Protective Association, and such
applicable ordinances and regulations of the City, affecting electrical
installations, which may be presently in effect, or changed by future
ordinances. All installations of equipment shall be of permanent nature,
durable and installed in accordance with good engineering practice, and of
sufficient height to comply with all existing City regulations, ordinances and
state laws so as not to interfere in any manner with the right of any public or
individual property owner, and shall not interfere with the travel and use of
public places by the public during the construction, repair or removal thereof,
and shall not obstruct or impede traffic.
(1979 Code 115.10)
705.11 SERVICE TO SCHOOLS.
   A company granted a franchise hereunder shall furnish and deliver all
signals carried by the company's system to a designated point outside the
school building but on the property or grounds of any public school within the
City, without charge. All attachment to and distribution of signals within any
school building or buildings shall be done by or at the expense of the school.
The company shall provide similar services without cost to private schools,
including parochial or other religious schools. The franchisee shall also
provide for those channels used by governmental and civic groups, otherwise
required by the rules and regulations of the FCC.
(1979 Code 115.11)
705.12 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   A company granted a franchise hereunder shall furnish a bond to the City in
the amount designated by the franchising authority and in such form and with
such sureties as shall be approved by the Service-Safety Director, guaranteeing
the faithful performance of all of the obligations of the franchisee under the
terms of this chapter, within thirty days after the commencement of this
franchise, if such bond has not already been given.
(1979 Code 115.12)
705.13 PREFERENTIAL AND DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES PROHIBITED.
   Any company selected hereunder shall not, as to monthly rates, service
facilities, rules, regulations, or in any other respect, make or grant any
preference or advantage to any person, nor subject any person to any prejudice
or disadvantage, provided that nothing in this franchise is deemed to prohibit
the establishment of a graduate scale of charges and classified rate schedules
to which any customer coming within such classification would be entitled, and
provided further that this section shall not prohibit the reduction or
elimination of installation or other one-time charges offered generally to the
public for a limited time to promote and encourage the installation of
additional cablevision connections.
(1979 Code 115.13)
705.14 APPROVAL OF FRANCHISE TRANSFERS.
   Council reserves the right to approve any transfers of the franchisee, in
order to insure uniformity of service and continuity of rate structures. In the
event of an approved franchise transfer, any resultant goodwill or going
business value shall not be recognized by the City as an investment in
subsequent rate review proceedings. Any company selected under the terms of
this chapter shall not sell, lease, assign or otherwise alienate the franchise
grant or any privilege thereunder, without first acquiring the approval of
Council.
(1979 Code 115.14)
705.15 FRANCHISE PROCESS.
   In order to provide for public participation in franchise selection and to
assure fundamentals of due process, the City adopts the following franchise
selection process:
   (a)   Council shall itself serve as the City's franchising authority.
   (b)   Council shall conduct the franchisee selection process herein
described and, after fully considering the evidence presented and the best
interests of the City, select cable television franchisees.
   (c)   Whenever any new system is proposed, or whenever Council determines
that the City is being inadequately serviced with cable television, Council
shall invite applications for a CATV franchise with the City and give adequate
public notice thereof.
   (d)   Whenever an existing franchise expires, a succeeding franchise shall
be designated a renewal franchise, regardless of any changes in the provisions
of the franchise agreement. An existing franchise shall be eligible to apply
for the renewal franchise. Other competing applicants shall also be permitted
to apply for the renewal franchise at the same time and be considered along
with the existing franchisee.
   (e)   Council shall place all franchise applications on public file,
available at reasonable times in the Clerk of Council's office.
   (f)   Council shall give public notice of all such filings, so that the
City's residents may familiarize themselves with the franchise applicants and
intelligently engage in the franchisee selection process.
   (g)   At a reasonable time in advance of any proposed public hearings,
Council shall publicly give adequate notice thereof.
   (h)   At a convenient time and place, Council shall then conduct a public
proceeding, at which all interested persons shall be afforded the opportunity
of testifying as to the qualifications of the various franchise applicants.
   (i)   At such public proceedings, Council shall examine, among other
factors, the applicants' legal character and financial and technical
qualifications, as well as the adequacy and feasibility of their construction
arrangements.
   (j)   Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of such public
proceedings, Council shall review the evidence presented and select a
franchisee.
(1)   In the case of a new franchise, Council shall select that applicant which
is best qualified to meet the needs of the City, and shall make a public report
setting forth the basis for its selection. The selection shall not be based
solely on which applicant offers the lower subscriber rates, but shall take
into account all the characteristics and qualifications of the applicant listed
in subsection (i) hereof and may further take into account the reputation, the
record of performance and the financial results an applicant may have developed
in operating CATV systems in various communities.
(2)   In the case of a renewal of an existing franchise, the existing
franchisee shall be selected over competing applicants if the existing
franchisee:
A.   Demonstrates that he possesses the requisite legal, character, financial
and technical qualifications;
B.   Establishes at the public hearing that during the preceding franchise
term, its record of performance has been satisfactory and its program service
has been substantially attuned to meeting the needs and interest of the area;
and
C.   Satisfies the franchising authority that it will provide at competitive
rates a quality of service and programming substantially equal or better than
that available to the City from other cablevision companies.
   (k)   Finally, Council shall enter into a nonexclusive cable television
franchise agreement, the terms of which shall comply in all substantial regards
with the provisions of this chapter as well as any amendments thereto. Any
individual franchise may include additional terms, not otherwise in conflict
with FCC rules or the express mandates of this chapter.
      (1979 Code 115.15)
705.16 FRANCHISE RECORD AND ACCOUNT KEEPING.
   (a)   Any company selected hereunder as a cable television franchisee shall
maintain a local office within the City to facilitate record keeping, the
payment of subscription charges and the handling of service complaints. The
City reserves the right to examine, and keep copies of, all records and
accounts of the company, and the right to audit, examine and keep copies of
such records and accounts, and to require from the company detailed reports at
any reasonable time relating to the finances and operation of such company. The
company shall regularly file its annual financial statements with the Clerk of
Council within seventy-five days after the end of its annual accounting period.
The company is further required to establish and maintain a separate section of
accounts and record keeping for that portion of its system operative within the
City limits and in contiguous area surrounding the City. The City may require
that the company file separate certified financial statements for the
franchisee's City activities.
   (b)   The company shall at all times keep on file with the Clerk of Council
an up-to-date copy of all pole rental agreements with telephone and electric
power companies.
   (c)   The company shall maintain an accurate and current record of all
service complaints it has received, including its disposition thereof, and
shall retain for inspection by the City all responses received from the annual
customer inquiry conducted pursuant to Section
705.18.
   (d)   The company shall file with the Clerk of Council a copy of any
additional documents or reports which it may judge relevant to the City's
supervision and regulation of the company's activities in the City and any and
all other documents and information as Council may reasonably request.
(1979 Code 115.16)
705.17 MANNER OF GIVING NOTICES.
   Whenever, by the terms of this chapter or any franchise agreement, the City
is required to give notice to the company, such notice shall be given in
writing addressed to the company's designated resident manager and delivered to
the principal office of the company in the City. Whenever the company is
required to give notice to the City, such notice shall be given in writing
addressed to the Clerk of Council and delivered to his office during ordinary
business hours.
(1979 Code 115.17)
705.18 SERVICE COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any company selected as a franchisee hereunder shall designate a
representative, who will be available at the company's local office at
reasonable hours, and who will be authorized to answer, and make adjustments in
response to, all service complaints of the public, including quality of service
and equipment malfunctions. If attempts at settling the subscriber-company
dispute fail at the representative level, the complainant may petition Council
for the appointment of a three-member arbitration board. The arbitration board
shall be comprised of one member selected by Council, one member selected by
the franchisee and one member selected by, and mutually agreeable to, the other
two members. The arbitration board thus empaneled shall be authorized to hear
testimony in an orderly and fair manner from both sides of the controversy and
render final judgment thereof. No judgment rendered by the arbitration board
shall be construed as precluding an otherwise actionable controversy in a court
of law of competent jurisdiction.
   (b)   At least annually, the company shall solicit comments from each of its
subscribers regarding local programming, the technical quality of its service,
and other CATV-related topics as Council may request.
(1979 Code 115.18)
705.19 RATE STRUCTURE AND FRANCHISE AGREEMENT STANDARDS.
   Any franchise agreement entered into between the City and the company shall
contain specific provisions which are consistent with the following
requirements:
   (a)   The franchise term shall be of reasonable duration, not in excess of
fifteen years.
   (b)   The franchise fee charged by the City shall be reasonable and not in
excess of three percent (3%) of the franshise's annual gross subscriber
revenues from cable television operation in the community, including all forms
of consideration such as initial lump sum payments.
   (c)   The subscription rate structure shall be fair and equitable to all
classes of service without unreasonable discrimination. Before any subscription
rate structure becomes effective (either the initial rate structure or any
subsequent amendment thereto), it shall first be approved by the franchising
authority after conducting appropriate public proceedings.
   (d)   At the end of the fifth and tenth years of any existing franchise
term, the franchising authority and its franchisee shall review as a matter of
course the existing rate structure, and either approve its continuance or make
such appropriate adjustments as may appear necessary to arriving at a figure
which is reasonable and fair to all parties. The foregoing five-year review
periods shall not be construed to prevent the franchisee from petitioning the
franchising authority for a change of subscription rates on a showing of cause.
      (1979 Code 115.19)
705.20 POLE LINE REGULATIONS.
   Any company selected hereunder shall furnish the City at least annually maps
or prints showing the pole line system in sufficient detail to assure the City
of being currently advised as to the location of the cables of the system. It
shall be the responsibility of the company to keep the City advised of any
material changes and additions, and removals in the system, except for the
individual subscriber's connection wires. Wherever, within the City, other wire
carriers such as telephone and electric utilities are compelled, required or
elect to place the wires underground, the company shall also place its wire
facilities underground. No poles or towers shall be installed by the company on
City streets, alleys or public ways except such poles as may be necessary due
to the fact that the pole spacing of either the electric or telephone utility
makes it impractical to use same. In such an event, the company may set an
intervening additional pole within the normal spacing of the electric or
telephone utility's pole line, providing specific written approval shall first
be obtained from the City Engineer as to actual need. In no event shall the
absence of a pole line agreement be regarded as justification for installing
poles or towers.
(1979 Code 115.20)
705.21 MANNER OF TERMINATION.
   (a)   The City reserves the right to revoke the rights of any franchise
granted hereunder if the company fails, after sixty days' written notice, to
comply with the conditions, provisions or regulations under this chapter or
under the terms of its franchise agreement. The company at any time during the
effective period of this chapter may terminate its agreement hereunder on
giving the City ninety days written notice of such termination, provided the
company pays the City, within thirty days of the effective date of such
termination, all sums due the City under the provisions of its franchise.
   (b)   (1)   On termination for cause as provided by this chapter, the City,
at its election, and on payment to the franchisee of a sum equal to the net
book value of the physical property of the system, shall have the right to
purchase and take over the CATV system in its entirety.
      (2)   On expiration of the term of any franchise granted hereunder, or on
receipt of an application for franchise transfer approval as set forth in
Section
705.14, the City, at its election, and on payment to the franchisee of a sum
equal to the fair market value of the physical property of the system, shall
have the right to purchase and take over the CATV system in its entirety.
      (3)   Under subsections (b)(1) and (2) hereof, any sum payable by the
City for net book value or fair market value shall in no event include and the
franchisee shall not receive anything for the valuation of "good-will" or of
any right or privilege appertaining to it under its franchise. On exercise of
either of these options by the City and its service of an official notice of
such action on the franchisee, and on payment of the purchase price, the
franchisee shall immediately transfer to the City possession and title to all
facilities and property, real and personal, of the CATV business, free from any
and all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the City in lieu of
some portion of the purchase price set forth above, and the franchisee shall
execute such warranty deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the City as
shall be necessary for the purpose.
   (c)   In order that the City may exercise its option to take over the
facilities and property of the system as herein provided, the franchisee shall
not make, execute or enter into any deed, deed of trust, mortgage, contract,
conditional sale contract or any loan, lease pledge, sale, gift, pole
agreement, or any other agreement concerning any of its facilities or property,
real or personal, without prior approval of Council.
(1979 Code 115.21)
705.22 SUPERVISION AND INSPECTION.
   The City shall have the right to supervise all construction or installation
work performed subject to the provisions of this chapter and any franchise
granted hereunder, and to make such inspections as it shall find necessary to
insure compliance with the governing ordinances and the terms of the franchise
agreement.

903.02 DEPOSIT REQUIRED BEFORE OPENING.
   No person, partnership or corporation, including any public utility or its

   No person shall open or disturb a greater area than that authorized by the
permit for which the deposit has been made. Should the above required deposit
exceed the actual cost of the supervision and expense of re-laying and
repairing the street or public way, then the excess shall be refunded. Any
public utility or its agents operating under a franchise with the City, or a
contractor, may, with the consent of the Engineering Department and the
Service-Safety Director, in lieu of the aforesaid deposit for each opening,
make a single deposit at the beginning of each calendar year in the amount of

hold harmless the City against any and all damages arising from the opening or
excavation made in the street or other public ways of the City, and further
conditioned to fill and place in good and safe condition, to the satisfaction
of the Service-Safety Director, all openings and excavations. Such bond shall

given under this provision each year conditioned as above to all openings and
excavations made in the streets or other public ways of the City, by the
principal in such bond during the term of one year from the date.

completely filled to the surface of the pavement, and such backfilling shall be
done within forty-eight hours after the completion of the work required by such
opening or excavation, and shall be done so as to make the traveled surface at
least as good as it was before it was disturbed. Any excavation or opening in
the paved portion of the street made by a public utility shall be repaved at
the cost of the person, partnership or corporation making such excavation, and
shall be replaced in accordance with specific directions from the Service-
Safety Director. Such paving shall be done not less than seven days after the
closing of the opening or excavation. All openings and excavations shall be put
in a condition safe for public travel on such street or public way. Any person,
partnership or corporation which leaves a job site or excavation in an
unfinished condition or in a condition hazardous to the public shall be subject

905.01 SIDEWALKS REQUIRED.
   Sidewalks shall be required as follows:
   (a)   On all streets in newly platted subdivisions.
   (b)   On properties where a new primary structure is being constructed.
   (c)   All streets (other than those in newly platted subdivisions) within
the corporate limits of the City, that do not have sidewalks on 100% of the
street frontage shall be designated as either a primary or secondary
thoroughfare. The intent of this chapter and a guiding principle of its
implementation shall be to exempt property owners from having to install
sidewalks whose houses abut quiet residential streets which experience minimal
or modest vehicular traffic that is primarily local in nature by designating
those streets as secondary thoroughfares.
   (d)   All street designations shall be promulgated at a public hearing by a
majority vote of a Street Designation Committee composed of: the Mayor; two
members of Council, one of which shall be the Chairman of the Streets and
Sidewalks Committee, the other to be nominated by the President of Council and
approved by a majority of Council; the Safety-Service Director; the City
Engineer; a citizen nominated by the President of Council and approved by a
majority of Council and a citizen nominated by the Mayor and approved by
Council. With the exception of the Mayor, the City Engineer and the Safety-
Service Director, all of whom shall be permanent members, Street Designation
Committee members shall serve staggered terms as follows, with vacancies to be
filled upon the expiration of that member's term: citizen nominated by the
Mayor, two years; citizen nominated by the President of Council, one year;
member of Council, one year; Chairman of Streets and Sidewalks, two years.
   (e)   Considerations in establishing or changing the designation of a street
(or any section thereof) as a primary or secondary thoroughfare shall be
primarily public safety as it relates to traffic, usage and practical need. In
the event any property owners abutting any street disagree with the designation
of their particular street, said owners may appeal directly to Council which
may, by a three-fourths majority vote, override the decision of the Street
Designation Committee.
   (f)   Streets which shall have been designated as primary thoroughfares
shall be required to have sidewalks installed by the property owners whose
property abuts the subject street pursuant to the provisions outlined in
Sections 905.02 through 905.08, inclusive.
   (g)   Streets which have been designated as a secondary thoroughfare shall
not be required to have sidewalks installed by the property owners whose
property abuts the subject street unless a majority of the property owners of a
particular street on a front footage basis (not just a majority of property
owners, but a majority of front footage owners) petition Council to require the
installation of sidewalks in the same manner and pursuant to the same criteria
established in these Codified Ordinances. If a majority of the owners on a
front footage basis have petitioned Council for the installation of sidewalks,
the provisions outlined in Sections 905.02 through 905.08, inclusive, shall
apply.
   (H)   This chapter repeals all pending orders by the City to install new
sidewalks.
      (Ord. 2002-108. Passed 12-17-02.)
905.02 SIDEWALKS NOT REQUIRED.
   Sidewalks shall not be required as follows by reason of the fact that they
do not constitute thoroughfares:
(Exemptions)
   (a)   Alleys and unplatted streets.
   (b)   On unimproved streets with a right of way of less than thirty feet.
   (c)   Cul-de-sacs with less than six fronting homes.
   (d)   Dead-end streets, excluding corner lots.
      (Init. Ord. Approved by voters 11-5-96.)
   (e)   In all platted and recorded industrial parks where said property is
zoned exclusively for industrial use.
      (Ord. 2000-10. Passed 2-15-00.)
   All matters pertaining to exemptions shall be under the jurisdiction and
authority of Council and its committees.
(Init. Ord. Approved by voters 11-5-96.)
905.03 PROCEDURE FOR REQUESTING VARIANCES.
   An appeal procedure for variances is established as follows:
   (a)   Variances may be granted for the following reasons:
      (1)   Variances for a specified period of time established by the City
Engineer.
         A.   Allowance for settling of sidewalk right of way due to recent
excavation and subsequent filling.
         B.   Evidence of scheduled construction or excavation within the
sidewalk right of way.
   (b)   Upon receipt of notice requiring installation and specified date of
completion, the property owner may file a request for variance. This appeal for
variance must be filed with Council no later than ninety days prior to the
completion date. Council shall retain exclusive authority to grant or rescind
all variances.
      (1)   Location variances.
         A.   Location variances may be granted as needed, provided continual
passage between abutting properties is maintained. Continual passage along
abutting properties should be in a consistent pattern.
      (2)   Indefinite variances.
         A.   Sidewalk installation impracticabilities, as determined by the
City Engineer, whereby existing buildings or mature shade trees preclude
installation of sidewalks at proper location on property.
         B.   Engineering impracticabilities, as determined by the City
Engineer, may provide cause for a variance to be granted until such time as the
problem is eliminated.
   (c)   This chapter rescinds all previously granted variances.
   (d)   All matters pertaining to variances shall be under the jurisdiction
and authority of Council and its committees.
      (Init. Ord. Approved by voters 11-5-96.)

information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations."
   The City will evaluate the complete disclosure form and data furnished by
the user and may require additional information. Within thirty days after full
evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the City shall notify the user
of the City's acceptance thereof.
      (3)   The City reserves the right to amend this chapter and the terms and
conditions hereof in order to assure compliance by the City with applicable
laws and regulations. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in the
chapter at least thirty days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes
or new conditions in the chapter shall include a reasonable time schedule for
compliance. All national categorical pretreatment standards now existing or
promulgated in the future shall be adopted by reference as part of this
chapter. Where a user, subject to a promulgated national categorical
pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted a disclosure form as
required by subsection (b)(2) hereof, the user shall file a disclosure form
with the City within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable national
categorical pretreatment standard by the U.S. EPA. In addition, any user
operating on the basis of a previous filing of a disclosure statement shall
submit to the City within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable
national categorical pretreatment standard, the additional information required
by subsection (b)(2)H. and I. hereof.
   (c)    (1)    Within ninety days following the date for final compliance by
the user with applicable pretreatment standards set forth in this chapter or
ninety days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW by a new source, any user subject to this chapter shall submit to the City
a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into
compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This
statement shall be signed in accordance with subsection (b)(2)L. hereof, and
certified by a qualified engineer (licensed to practice in the State of Ohio).
      (2)    A.    Any significant industrial user shall submit to the City
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the

regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment
standards hereof. In addition, this report shall include a record of all
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting
period reported in subsection (c)(1) hereof. Flows shall be reported on the
basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility
considerations justify, the City may accept reports of average and maximum
flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The City, for good cause shown
considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles or other extenuating factors may authorize the submission of such
reports on months other than those specified above.
         B.   Reports of users shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the City. The frequency of monitoring
by the user shall be as prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard of
this chapter. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part
136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling
or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis
shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA
publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of
the U.S. EPA.
         C.   Sampling technique requirements;
            1.   Except as indicated in paragraphs 2. and 3. below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by (the Superintendent). Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by (the City), the samples
must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab sample collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples
may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and
oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite
samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by (the City), as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
Instantaneous Limits.
            2.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
            3.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
90-day compliance reports required in Section 6.1 and 6.3 (40 CFR 403.12(b) and
(d), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling date is available, (the Superintendent) may authorize a
lower minimum. For reports required by paragraphs Section 6.4 (40 CFR 403.12(e)
and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to collect a number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by which applicable
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
         D.   All industrial users shall notify the Superintendent 30 days
prior of any substantial change in the operations, volume or character of
pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under
40 CFR 403.12(p).
         E.   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation
of discharge limitations, the user shall notify the City within twenty-four
hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the City
within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation, except the user is
not required to resample if:
            1.   The City performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at
least once per month, or
            2.   The City performs sampling at the user between the time when
user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
         F.   If sampling performed by the control authority indicates a
violation of discharge limitations, the control authority shall perform the
repeat sampling and analysis within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the
violation unless it notifies the user and requires the user to perform the
repeat sampling and analysis.
         G.   If the industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently
than required by the City the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the periodic self-monitoring report.
         H.   Industrial Users with applicable standards that require
compliance with a BMP or a pollution prevention alternative shall submit
documentation to determine compliance with the standard when submitting
baseline or periodic compliance reports.
   (d)   Each user shall provide and operate at the user's own expense, a
monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each
sewer discharge to the City. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the
user's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, the City may concur with the facility being
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility
is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
The monitoring structure shall have an opening of no less than twenty-two
inches diameter and an internal diameter of no less than thirty-six inches
containing flow measuring, recording and sampling equipment as required by the
City to assure compliance with this chapter. There shall be ample room in or
near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense
of the user. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of permit by user.
   (e)   The City may inspect the monitoring facilities of any user to
determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The user shall
allow the City's representative(s) to enter upon the premises of the user at
all reasonable hours, for the purposes of inspection, sampling or records
examination. The City shall have the right to set up on the user's property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance
monitoring and/or metering operations.
   (f)   Information and data furnished to the City with respect to the nature
and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of the user.
   When requested by a user furnishing a report, the portions of a report which
may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public shall be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the national pollutant
discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/
or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report
shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in judicial review
or enforcement proceedings involving the user furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information.
   Information accepted by the City as confidential, shall not be transmitted
to any governmental agency by the City until and unless a ten-day notification
is given to the user.
(Ord. 2009-041. Passed 5-5-09.)
925.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   The City may for good cause shown suspend the wastewater treatment
service to a user when it appears to the City that an actual or threatened
discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the health
or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment, interferes with
the operation of the POTW, or violates any pretreatment limits imposed by this
chapter. Any user notified of the suspension of the City's wastewater treatment
service shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the City,
cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the user to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order within the specified time, the City shall commence
judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the user's compliance
with such order. The City shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service and
terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the user of the elimination of
the non-complying discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or
substantial danger as set forth above.
   (b)   The City may seek to terminate the wastewater treatment services to
any user which exhibits significant non-compliance from any permitted
monitoring points. A user shall be considered in significant non-compliance if
its violations meet one or more of the following criteria.
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
during a six month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit,
instantaneous limits or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of the measurements taken
during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the average maximum
limit, instantaneous limits or the average limit times the applicable TRC
(TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except PH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum, instantaneous limits, longer-term average or BMPs) that the City
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass-through (including endangering the health or POTW
personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of its emergency authority under subsection (a) hereof to halt or
prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Violation, by ninety days or more after the scheduled date, of a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order, for starting construction, completing construction or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide required reports such as baseline monitoring
reports, ninety-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and
reports on compliance with schedules within forty-five days of the due date;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (8)   Any other violation or group of violations which the City considers
to be significant.
   (c)   Whenever the City finds that any user has engaged in conduct which
justifies termination of a wastewater treatment services, pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof, the City shall serve or cause to be served upon such
user, a written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within
thirty days of the date of receipt of the notice, the user shall respond
personally or in writing to the City, advising of its position with respect to
the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity
of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory
correction thereof.
   (d)   Where the violation of subsection (b) hereof is not corrected by
timely compliance by means of administrative adjustment, the City may order any
user which causes or allows conduct prohibited by subsection (b) hereof, to
show cause before the City or its duly authorized representative, why the
proposed service termination action should not be taken. A written notice shall
be served on the user by personal service, certified or registered, return
receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
City or its designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement
action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user
to show cause before the City or its designee why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less
than ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer or
authorized representative of a user. The proceedings at the hearing shall be
considered by the City which shall then enter appropriate orders with respect
to the alleged improper activities of the user. Appeal of such orders may be
taken by the user in accordance with applicable local or state law.

      (1)   Quantity of Wastewater Discharged (Q). The volume used for
computing industrial waste charges shall be the metered water consumption of
the user as shown in the records of water meter readings maintained by the City
except as provided herein in this section. If the user discharging industrial
wastes into the public sewers procures any part, or all of this water from the
user shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type approved
by the City Engineer for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from those other sources. The user discharging industrial wastes into
the public sewers may install and maintain at his expense a metering instrument
for determining the volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer. The
instruments shall be of a type acceptable to the City Engineer. The City
Engineer may require the installation of an instrument for measuring the volume
of waste discharged if the volume cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records. Any instrument for determining the volume of
waste discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned, maintained and
calibrated annually at the expense of the user. Certification that the
calibration has been performed shall be provided to the City Engineer within
thirty (30) days of the calibration.
      (2)   A significant industrial user is defined by the City in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.0, subsection t, as:
         A.   All users subject to categorical pretreatment standards; or
         B.   Any user that discharges an average of 25,000 or more gallons per
day to the sewer system; or
         C.   Any user that contributes five percent (5%) or more of the
average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant; or
         D.   Any user that, in the opinion of the Service Director, has a
reasonable potential to adversely affect the performance of the wastewater
treatment plant or for violating any pretreatment standards.
      (3)   The charge for the quantity of waste discharged, and for industrial
waste discharges where concentrations of the following parameters exceed the
limits set forth in Sections
925.06 (d) or
925.07 (e), shall be as follows:
 
WASTEWATER SERVICE – MAJOR INDUSTRIAL
 
Q   $0.76 per hundred cubic feet
COD $0.16 per pound
SS  $0.16 per pound
P   $1.33 per pound
NH3 $0.96 per pound
 
Q =   Flow
COD = Chemical Oxygen Demand
SS =  Suspended Solids
P =   Total Phosphorus
NH3 = Ammonia
   In addition to the above, the monthly minimum based on meter size will be
charged.
   (c)   Any residential customer of the wastewater system that does not also
have City water service shall be billed for their wastewater discharge on the
basis of a usage of 6,000 gallons per month (800 cubic feet). The usage for any
nonresidential customer in this situation shall be established by the City
Engineer.
   (d)   On an annual basis, at a time to be determined by the POTW authority,
the costs associated with all facets of the POTW operation, including but not
limited to: OM & R, debt service and administration and billing, shall be
audited. At that time, any necessary changes in the user charges will be made
to reflect each user's fair and equitable share of total costs.
   (e)   On an annual basis, and at a time of a regular billing, each user
shall be notified of the rate and that portion of the user's sewer service
charge which is attributable to OM & R costs to wastewater treatment services.
   (f)   All users connected to the POTW shall compensate the POTW for their
fair and equitable share of total treatment costs. No free service shall be
made to any user.
   (g)   The sewerage service charge or rental provided in this chapter shall
be payable monthly at the water and sewer office of the City, and at the option
of such office, may be payable at the same time as water bills are payable.
   (h)   A customer or specific group of customers of the wastewater system who
for their own benefit cause a capital improvement to be made to the wastewater
system, such customer or customers may be required to pay for the partial or
total cost of such improvement. The actual cost of the improvement shall be
determined by the City Engineer and the terms and amount of the payment shall
be determined by City.
      (Ord. 2011-022. Passed 5-3-11.)
925.161 TEMPORARY DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   (a)   Temporary discharge permits are issued for customer who will discharge
into the City's wastewater system for a specific period of time. While these
customers are required to sample and test their discharges, the City does not
currently charge temporary discharge customers for collection and treatment.
This creates an inequity as these discharges, often treated on-site, add to the
flows received and treated by the City's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). The
costs associated with treating these flows are resultantly borne by the other
users of the system.
   (b)   One approach for charging temporary discharge permits would include a
permit fee and a volume charge. The permit fee would recover customer costs
related to setting up a new account and account billing, as well as costs
associated with testing and monitoring the temporary discharge concentration
and loadings. The fee would be based on the cost per full time equivalent (FTE)
employee(s) that would be assigned to complete each of these activities. In
addition, a volume charge would be levied that would recover costs associated
with the additional flows and loadings discharged into the City's wastewater
system.

(Ord. 2011-022. Passed 5-3-11.)
925.17 SERVICE CHARGE A LIEN ON LAND OR PREMISES.
   Each charge or rental levied by or pursuant to this chapter is made a lien
upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection to the
wastewater system of the City, and if the same is not paid within thirty days
after it shall be due and payable, it shall be certified to the Hancock County
Auditor who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the County with the
interest and penalties allowed by law and be collected as other taxes are
collected.
(Ord. 1992-12. Passed 5-5-92.)
925.18 WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FUND.
   The funds received from the collection of the charges or rentals authorized
by this chapter and all other receipts resulting from the operation of the POTW
shall be deposited with the City Treasury and shall be accounted for and be
known as the Water Pollution Control Fund and when appropriated by Council,
shall be available for the payment of the cost of operation and maintenance of
the POTW and any surplus in such fund shall be used for the payment of the
principal and interest on bonds and notes issued and outstanding with which to
pay the City's portion of the cost of the construction of the POTW and for the
enlargement or replacement of the POTW. (Ord. 1992-12. Passed 5-5-92.)
925.19 WASTEWATER TREATMENT CAPACITY CHARGE.
   In order to partially pay for the ultimate investment required by the City
for wastewater treatment facilities to serve additional users of the wastewater
system, all connections made to the POTW shall pay the following charge per
sewer connection:
   (a)   For residential service: two hundred forty-two dollars ($242.00) per

937.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to meet USEPA standards, and establish
technically feasible and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level
of Drainage, Erosion and Sediment Control that will minimize damage to property
and degradation of Water Resources and Wetlands, and will promote and maintain
the health and safety of the citizens of Findlay. The objectives of this
regulation are based on USEPA mandates to control Storm Water quantity,
quality, and Erosion and are intended to:
   (a)   Allow development and/or redevelopment within the municipal boundaries
and outside the municipal boundaries that discharge to the MS4 while minimizing
impacts to existing Drainage courses and increases in Erosion and
Sedimentation.
      (1)   Control Storm Water Runoff from such Parcels and ensure that all
Storm Water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of Storm Water Runoff
originating from such Parcels so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and Erosion potential are not increased.
      (3)   Preserve natural Infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes Water Resources.
      (4)   Maximize the use of Storm Water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, Erosion and
Sediment Control, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (5)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated Soil Disturbing Activity in order to minimize the City of
Findlay from future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream
crossings.
   (b)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving Water Resources and Wetlands
that may be caused by new development and redevelopment activities.
(Ord. 2015-038. Passed 5-19-15.)
937.02 APPLICABILITY.

compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (b)   This Chapter does not require a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3) for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation on private property and approved by the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio or the U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), that do not result in the
installation of impervious surface as determined by the City of Findlay
Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize the number of stream
crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear construction projects must
comply with USEPA requirements regarding Erosion and Sediment Control.

(Ord. 2015-038. Passed 5-19-15.)
937.05 DEVELOPMENT OF DRAINAGE PLANS.
   (a)   This Chapter requires that a drainage plan be submitted and
implemented for all Parcels that are being developed or redeveloped and that
are subject to site plan or plat approval, unless specifically exempted in
Section
937.02.
   (b)   The following information shall be submitted as part of an engineered
site plan or construction drawing application.
      (1)   The design of storm sewer systems will be based upon the "Rational
Method" using the equation Q=CiA and the "Manning Formula" (A is less than 100
acres). Areas greater than 100 acres use State of Ohio Bulletin Number 43 and
compare with Bulletin Number 45 Floods in Ohio or Soil Conservation Service
Technical Release #55, 2nd edition.
      (2)   Complete drainage calculations shall be submitted for pipe size
determinations, 10 year hydraulic gradient checks and catch basin type and
spacing designs. All culverts will be designed for a 10 year frequency storm
with a hydraulic gradient check for a 25 year storm. The HGL shall be
consistent with any data available at the City or County Engineer's office if
established. Drainage calculations shall be prepared, organized, and submitted
in a report format for review by the City engineer. The report shall include
the designer and/or reviewer name(s) and the seal, signature, and date of the
Professional Engineer responsible for the calculations in accordance with
Section 4733.14 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (3)   Storm sewers shall be designed to flow just full for the 5 year
intensity-duration-frequency curve. The minimum velocity at just full shall be
2 feet per second. Minimum pavement gutter elevations shall be at or above the
hydraulic grade line for a 10 year frequency storm. Use the 10 year intensity-
duration-frequency curve for determining this hydraulic grade line.
      (4)   Detention/Retention facilities will be required. Existing
conditions may limit the allowable out flow of the proposed site. The allowable
outflow will be limited to the existing 5 year intensity storm for existing
conditions of the proposed site and/or available capacity of the outlet,
whichever is lesser. The detention facility shall store the proposed inflow
from a 100 year intensity storm without overtopping a multi-stage outlet
control structure.
      (5)   A flood route will be shown on the plan depicting the flow path of
storm water in the event of a structure failure or storm that exceeds design
capacity
      (6)   Grading plans will be required showing the proposed elevations at
the right of way line, building lines and back lot lines. In areas where the
site grading plan calls for the conveyance of surface storm water along or
across rear property lines, a catch basin shall be provided. An absolute
minimum grade of 0.3% shall be provided for rear lot swales. Flood routing
shall be illustrated for the structures.
      (7)   Flood Hazard Boundary (if applicable) shall be shown along with a
clear delineation and plan for work within the Flood Hazard Zone. Any FEMA
permits required to accomplish grading and or construction objectives shall be
identified. Reference also the City of Findlay Flood Damage Reduction
Ordinance.
 
   (c)   FEMA regulations shall be strictly followed for all developments.
Impacts on floodway and floodway fringe shall be addressed. Filling in
floodplain requires a permit the City of Findlay. Flood boundaries shall be
shown on plans along with 100 year storm elevations. All necessary CLOMRs,
LOMRs, or LOMAs shall be secured from FEMA before construction of buildings can
commence. FEMA studied streams and ditches require that new structures do not

in accordance with the requirements of this regulation.
   (a)   Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) required: The applicant
shall develop a SWP3 describing how the quantity and quality of Storm Water
will be managed after construction is complete for every discharge from the
site and/or into a Water Resource. The Plan will illustrate the type, location,
and dimensions of every non-structural and Structural Storm Water Management
Practice incorporated into the site design, and the rationale for their
selection. The rationale must address how these storm water management
practices will address flooding within the site as well as flooding that may be
caused by the development upstream and downstream of the site. The rationale
will also describe how the storm water management practices minimize impacts to
the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of on-site and
downstream Water Resources and, if necessary, correct current degradation of
Water Resources that is occurring or take measures to prevent predictable
degradation of Water Resources.

937.10 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The intent of the ordinance is not to specify the engineering methodology
required for meeting NPDES standards. Acceptable methods for erosion and
sediment control as defined in the most recent edition of Ohio Department of
Natural Resource Rainwater and Land Development (Ohio's Standards for
Stormwater Management, Land Development and Urban Stream Protection) or the
USDA NRCS Field Office Technical Guide.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to re-stabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Inspections Requirements. All controls on the site shall be inspected
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen).
The applicant shall assign CPESC qualified inspection personnel to conduct
these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to
evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures
are required.
      These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City of Findlay or an alternate form
acceptable to the City of Findlay Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   General weather information for the period since the last
inspection, or in the case of a large storm/discharge, a best estimate of the
beginning of each storm event, duration of each storm event and approximate
amount of rainfall for each storm event in inches, and whether any discharges
occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Final Stablization. Final stabilization shall be determined by a
certified inspector and notice given to the City of Findlay Engineering
Department. The City may perform inspection before bonds are released.
   (j)   Annual Inspection. Annual inspections by a CPESC Certified

939.04, "Definitions Applicable to Type I Applications for Minor
Modifications," the following words and phrases used in this Chapter
939 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this Section
939.03, regardless of whether or not the words and phrases are capitalized.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.1 ANTENNA.
   "Antenna" means any apparatus designed for the purpose of the transmission
and/or reception of radio frequency ("RF") radiation, to be operated or
operating from a fixed location to facilitate wireless communications services
including but not limited to the transmission of writings, signs, signals,
data, images, pictures, and sounds of all kinds.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.2 APPLICANT.
   "Applicant" means any person that submits an application to the city to
site, install, construct, collocate, modify, and/or operate a Wireless
Communications Facility in the right of way. (Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.3 BASE STATION.
   "Base Station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001
(b)(1), as may be amended and interpreted by the FCC and any other authority
with competent jurisdiction, which defines that term as follows:
   A structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or
authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications
network. The term does not encompass a Tower as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001
(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a Tower.
   (i)   The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with
wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety
services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services
such as microwave backhaul.
   (ii)   The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers,

communications facilities in the right of way, which are supplemented by Design
Guidelines, and which are effective insofar as they do not conflict with state
or federal law, including without limitation any applicable FCC rules and
regulations.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.7 ELIGIBLE SUPPORT STRUCTURE.
   "Eligible Support Structure" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47
C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[a]ny
tower or base station as defined in this section, provided that it is existing
at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local
government under this section."   
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.8 POTENTIAL SUPPORT STRUCTURE.
   "Potential Support Structure" means an existing building or structure, other
than a Tower as defined in this section, that may be transformed into a base
station through the mounting or installation of an antenna or transmission
equipment after that city approves it as a support structure and the permittee
installs transmission equipment pursuant to such approval; Potential Support
Structures include but are not limited to buildings, steeples, water towers,
utility poles, light poles, City-owned structures in the right of way, and
outdoor advertising signs.   
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)

   "Person" means, without limitation, a natural person, a corporation, whether
nonprofit or for profit, a partnership, a limited liability company, an
unincorporated society or association, and two or more persons having a joint
or common interest.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.10 RIGHT OF WAY.
   "Right of Way" means real property for or devoted to (1) public
transportation purposes; or (2) the placement of the city's municipal utility
easements and other traditional uses along a transportation route, whether by
dedication, prescription, or otherwise, as well as the spaces above and below.
In addition to the foregoing, the definition of right of way includes, without
limitation, public highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges,
aqueducts, and viaducts within the city. (Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.11 SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE.
    "Substantial change" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. §
1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, and as applicable to facilities in the public
right-of-way, which defines that term as a collocation or modification that:
   (a)   Increases the overall height more than 10% or 10 feet (whichever is
greater);
   (b)   Increases the width more than 6 feet from the edge of the wireless
tower or base station;
   (c)   Involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground
when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets;
   (d)   Involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets
that are ten percent (10%) larger in height or volume than any existing ground-
mounted equipment cabinets;
   (e)   Involves excavation or deployment of equipment outside the area in
proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on
the ground;
   (f)   Would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support
structure as determined by the City of Findlay Engineering Department; or
   (g)   Violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the
collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to
height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the
thresholds for a substantial change.
   Note: For clarity, the definition in this Chapter includes only the
definition of a substantial change as it applies to facilities in the public
right-of-way. The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are
disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds
means that a substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height
increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated
deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted
support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless
equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically
separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site
dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012, the date that Congress passed
Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act. (Ord.
2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.12 TOWER.
   "Tower" means any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of
supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated
facilities, that are constructed for wireless communications services
including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services,
as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as
microwave backhaul, and the associated site, as more specifically defined by
the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended or superseded.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.13 TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT.
   "Transmission Equipment" means any equipment that facilitates transmission
of any FCC licensed or authorized wireless communications service, including
but not limited to radio transceivers, and other relevant equipment associated
with and necessary to their operation, including coaxial or fiber-optic cable,
and regular and backup power supply, as more specifically defined by the FCC in
47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(8). This definition includes equipment in any
technological configuration associated with any FCC authorized wireless
transmission, licensed or unlicensed, commercial mobile, private mobile, fixed
wireless microwave backhaul, and fixed broadband. (Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-
17.)
939.03.14 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.
   "Wireless Communications Facility" means any unstaffed installation for the
transmission and/or reception of radio frequency signals for wireless
communications services, typically consisting of a tower or base station,
transmission equipment, equipment cabinets, and all materials or techniques
used to conceal the installation.

MODIFICATIONS.
   For Type I applications for minor modifications, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them below, regardless of whether
or not the words and phrases are capitalized. In the event that any defined
term conflicts with any applicable federal law or regulation, the federal law
or regulation shall control.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.18 ELIGIBLE SUPPORT STRUCTURE REQUEST.
   "Eligible Support Structure Request" means the same as defined by the FCC in
47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[a]ny
request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not
substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station,
involving: (i) [c]ollocation of new transmission equipment; (ii) [r]emoval of
transmission equipment; or (iii) [r]eplacement of transmission equipment."
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.03.19 EXISTING.
   "Existing" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)
(4), as may be amended, which provides that "[a] constructed tower or base
station is existing for purposes of [the FCC's Section 6409(a) regulations] if
it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting
process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, provided
that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a
zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for
purposes of this definition."

nonbinding estimate of the cost for such review. The applicant shall have five
business days from the date of mailing of notice to elect to withdraw the
application without any liability for any costs or expenses in connection with
the independent technical review.
      (2)   Scope. The City of Findlay Engineering Department may request
independent consultant review on any issue that involves specialized or expert
knowledge in connection with the permit application. Technical review issues
may include, but are not limited to:
         i.   permit application completeness or accuracy;
         ii.   planned compliance with applicable RF exposure standards;
         iii.   whether and where a significant gap exists or may exist, and
whether such a gap relates to service coverage or service capacity;
         iv.   the applicability, reliability, and/or sufficiency of analyses
or methodologies used by the applicant to reach conclusions about any issue
within this scope; and
         v.   any other issue that requires expert or specialized knowledge
identified by the department of transportation and engineering.
      (3)   No permit until payment. The applicant must pay for the cost of
consultant technical review and for the technical consultant's testimony in any
hearing as requested by the department of transportation and engineering. No
permit shall issue to an applicant where that applicant has not timely paid any
fee required under the Municipal Code or if the applicant owes payment on
outstanding invoices for costs recoverable by the City under this Chapter

939.06 APPLICATION REVIEW AND WIRELESS FACILITY RIGHT-OF-WAY OCCUPANCY PERMIT.
   (a)   General Standard of Review for Wireless Communications Facilities. All
wireless communications facilities in the right of way shall conform to the
provisions of this chapter and to the Design Guidelines as modified from time
to time by the City of Findlay Engineering Department. The City of Findlay
Engineering Department shall review and consider each application according to
the application classifications, review processes, and deployment standards
described in the Design Guidelines.
   (b)   Notice to Residents. Within 10 days of filing a Type II or Type III
application, the applicant shall provide the City of Findlay Engineering
Department with proof of notice to the owners of all real property located
within a 200-foot radius of the site of the proposed Wireless Communications
Facility as well as notice to the corresponding community council(s). The
notice shall inform interested persons of the opportunity to file written
comments to be submitted to the City of Findlay Engineering Department, which
comments should address whether the application conforms to the provisions of
this chapter. The applicant shall provide the City of Findlay Engineering
Department with proof that the notice required under this section has been
given, including a mailing list for all recipients and a copy of the mailed
notice. Notwithstanding the above, City of Findlay Engineering Department at
its discretion, may provide additional public notice if it determines such
notice is in the best interests of the public. Notice shall not be required for
Type I applications.
   (c)   Written Decision.  Within five working days after the City of Findlay
Engineering Department renders a decision on an application, it shall send
written notice to the applicant. Any denial shall include the reasons for the
denial and information regarding the process for an administrative appeal under

939.06.
   (d)   Approval. Approval of an application shall include the following
permissions:
      (1)   Permit to construct. A permit to construct the approved wireless
communications facility, subject to any conditions established by the City of
Findlay Engineering Department to carry out the purposes and intent of this
chapter and the Cincinnati Municipal Code.
       (2)   Wireless facility right-of-way occupancy permit. A wireless right-
of-way occupancy permit ("Wireless ROW Permit") granting the applicant
permission to occupy the right of way at the proposed site and subject to (a)
the standard conditions required by Section
939.07 and (b) any additional conditions required by the City of Findlay
Engineering Department to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter and
the Findlay Municipal Code. The Wireless ROW Permit shall not convey title,
equitable or legal, in the right of way.
   (e)   Restrictions on Wireless ROW Permits. A Wireless ROW Permit may be
transferred upon notification to the city and acceptance by the transferee to
allow the transferee to site wireless facilities in the same location on the
same supporting structure as the transferor. Such a transfer may be made only
to a provider who possesses a current Wireless ROW Permit from the city for
siting wireless facilities elsewhere in the right of way.
   (f)    Denial.  The city reserves the right to deny an application if any
one of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The applicant has not demonstrated that its application conforms to
the provisions of this chapter and the Findlay Municipal Code, including the
Design Guidelines established pursuant to this chapter;
      (2)   The applicant is not authorized to conduct business in the State of
Ohio;
      (3)   For any Type I application, the applicant has failed to show that
the project qualifies for approval pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) and the
related FCC regulations at 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001 et seq.;
      (4)   For any Type II or Type III application, the applicant has failed
within the prior three years to comply or is presently not in full compliance
with the requirements of this chapter with regard to another Wireless
Communications Facility that is not the subject of the application in question;
      (5)   The applicant is in default of its obligation to pay to the city
fees imposed by this chapter;
      (6)   The design or location does not comply with the relevant standards
promulgated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) and utilized by the department of transportation of
engineering for construction in the right of way;
      (7)   The design or location does not comply with current or proposed
Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) promulgated by
the United State Access Board.
   (g)   Appeal of Denial on the Merits. Upon denial of an application for
failure to meet the requirements of this chapter, the applicant may appeal the
decision to the Public Service Director for reconsideration. The appeal must be
in writing and delivered to the director no later than 5:00 p.m. (EST) on the
tenth business day after written notification by the city of denial of the
permit. An appeal must provide a detailed explanation, in writing, of the
reasons the applicant contends the proposed wireless facility satisfies the
requirements of Chapter
939 (including if the application qualifies for a limited exemption for
personal wireless service facilities under Section
939.06(h). The appeal should include supporting documentation. The director
shall review the written appeal together with other evidence in the record and
grant the permit if the director determines that, based on substantial evidence
in the application record, the permit complies with the requirements of Chapter
939. The director shall issue a written decision within ten (business days of
the filing of the appeal. Failure by applicant to appeal and request
reconsideration under this section shall constitute a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies for purposes of any subsequent appeal in a court of
law.
   (h)   Limited Exemption for Personal Wireless Service Facilities. Federal
law prohibits a permit denial when it would effectively prohibit the provision
of personal wireless services. Due to wide variation among wireless facilities
and technical service objectives, and due to changed circumstances over time, a
limited exemption for proposals in which strict compliance with this chapter
would effectively prohibit personal wireless services serves the public
interest. Circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are
extremely difficult to discern, and specified findings to guide the analysis
promotes clarity and the City's legitimate interest in well-planned wireless
facilities deployment. Therefore, in the event that any applicant asserts that
strict compliance with any provision in this chapter, as applied to a specific
proposed wireless communications facility, would effectively prohibit the
provision of personal wireless services, the Public Service Director may grant
a limited, one-time exemption from strict compliance, subject to the following
provisions:
      (1)   Required findings.  The director of the department of
transportation and engineering shall not grant any exemption unless the
applicant provides each of the following:
         i.   Evidence that the proposed wireless facility qualifies as a
"personal wireless services facility" as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(C)
(ii);
         ii.   A clearly defined and reasonable technical service objective and
a clearly defined potential site search area; and
         iii.   A meaningful comparative analysis that includes the factual
reasons why (1) any alternative location(s) or design(s) suggested by the City
or otherwise identified in the administrative record are not technically
feasible and (2) the proposed location and design deviation is the least
noncompliant location and design necessary to reasonably achieve the
applicant's technical service objective.
      (2)   Scope of exemption. The Public Service Director shall limit the
exemption to the extent to which the applicant demonstrates such exemption is
necessary to reasonably achieve its reasonable technical service objectives.
The City of Findlay Engineering Department may adopt conditions of approval
specific to a permit issued as a limited exemption pursuant to this section, as
reasonably necessary to promote the purposes in this chapter and protect the
public health, safety, and welfare.
         (Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.07 STANDARD CONDITIONS OF PERMIT APPROVAL.
   (a)   Standard Conditions of Approval. Permission to site wireless
communications facilities in the right of way shall be conditioned on
compliance with the standard conditions of approval provided in this Section
939.07. The City of Findlay Engineering Department may add or modify conditions
of approval as necessary or appropriate to protect and promote the public
health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Wireless ROW Permit Duration. For Type II and Type III permits, the
Wireless ROW Permit will automatically expire one year from the date of
issuance, except when federal or state law authorizes the City to issue a
permit with a shorter term. Any request for a permit renewal shall be reviewed
as a request for a new permit subject to all applicable procedures and
standards in effect at the time the request is received.   
   (c)   Standard Conditions of Approval for Type I Permits. Any Type I permit
approved or deemed granted by the operation of law shall be automatically
subject to the following conditions of approval:   
      (1)   Permit duration. The city's grant or grant by operation of law of a
Type I permit constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying
permit or approval of the subject tower and/or base station. The City's grant
or grant by operation of law of a Type I permit will not extend the permit term
for any underlying permit or other regulatory approval, and its term shall be
coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the
subject tower or base station.   
      (2)   Accelerated permit terms due to invalidation. In the event that any
court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a)
or any FCC rule that interprets 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) such that federal law would
not mandate approval of any Type I permit, such permit shall automatically
expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order, unless the
decision specifically does not authorize accelerated termination of previously
approved Type I permits. A permittee shall not be required to remove its
improvements approved under the invalidated Type I permit if it submits an
application for a Type II or Type III permit for those
improvements before the one-year period ends. The City of Findlay Engineering
Department may extend beyond one-year the time in which a permittee may apply
for a Type II or Type III permit for an invalidated Type I permit.   
      (3)   No waiver of standing.  The City's grant or grant by operation of
law of a Type I permit does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any
standing by the City to challenge 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), any FCC rules that
interpret 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), or any particular Type I permit.   
   (d)   Standard Conditions of Approval for All Wireless ROW Permits. All
applications for Type I, II, and III permits shall be subject to the following
standard conditions of approval by operation of law:
      (1)   Compliance with all applicable laws. Permittee shall at all times
maintain compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
regulations, ordinances, or other rules.   
      (2)   Inspections; emergencies. The City or its designee may inspect a
Wireless Communications Facility in the right of way upon reasonable notice to
the permittee. The permittee shall cooperate with all inspections. The City
reserves the right to support, repair, disable, or remove any elements of the
facility in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons
or property.   
      (3)   Contact information for responsible parties.  Permittee shall at
all times maintain accurate contact information for all parties responsible for
the facility, which shall include a phone number, street mailing address, and
email address for at least one natural person. All such contact information for
responsible parties shall be provided to the City of Findlay Engineering
Department.   
      (4)   Indemnities. The permittee and, if applicable, the non-government
owner of a Wireless Communications Facility shall defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless the City and its agents, officers, officials, and employees from:
         i.   Any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and
expenses arising out of any claims, demands, lawsuits, writs of mandamus, or
other actions or proceedings brought against the City to challenge, attack,
seek to modify, set aside, void, or annul the City's approval of the applicable
Wireless ROW Permit; and
         ii.   Any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and
expenses and any claims, demands, lawsuits, or other actions or proceedings of
any kind, whether for personal injury, death, or property damage, arising out
of or in connection with the activities or performance of the permittee or its
agents, employees, licensees, contractors, subcontractors, or independent
contractors.
         iii.   In the event the City becomes aware of any such actions or
claims, the City shall promptly notify the permittee and shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense. It is expressly agreed that the City shall have the
right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal
counsel providing the City's defense, and the permittee (as applicable) shall
reimburse City for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by
the City in the course of the defense.   
      (5)   Interference with public safety radio services.  In the event that
the City has reason to believe that permittee's radio communications operations
are causing interference with the City's radio communications operations, then
the permittee shall, at its cost, immediately cooperate with the City to either
rule out permittee as the interference source or eliminate the interference.
Cooperation with the City may include, but shall not be limited to, temporarily
switching the transmission equipment on and off for testing.   
      (6)   Adverse impacts on adjacent properties. Permittee shall undertake
all reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse impacts to adjacent properties
and/or uses that may arise from the construction, operation, maintenance,
modification, or removal of the facility.   
      (7)   General maintenance. The site and the facility, including but not
limited to all landscaping, fencing, and related transmission equipment, must
be maintained in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved
plans and conditions of approval.   
      (8)   Good condition required.  Wireless communications facilities shall
at all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order, and repair by
qualified maintenance and construction personnel, so that the same shall not
menace or endanger the life or property of any person.   
      (9)   Graffiti abatement.  Permittee shall remove any graffiti on the
wireless facility at permittee's sole expense.   
      (10)   RF exposure compliance. All facilities must comply with all
standards and regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal government
agency with the authority to regulate RF exposure standards.   
      (11)   Relocation for public improvement projects. Permittee shall remove
and relocate the permitted Wireless Communications Facility at permittee's sole
expense to accommodate construction of a public improvement project by the City
of Findlay.
      (12)   Removal if discontinued use.  In the event that the use of a
Wireless Communications Facility is discontinued, the owner shall provide
written notice to the city of its intent to discontinue use and the date when
the use shall be discontinued. If a Wireless Communications Facility is not
removed within ninety (90) days of discontinued use, the city may remove it at
the owner's expense irrespective of the notice requirement under this section.
      (13)   Taxes and assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments
are imposed by taxing authorities on the use of city property as a result of an
applicant's use or occupation of the right of way, the applicant shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise
required by the taxing authority.
         (Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.08 DESIGN STANDARDS AND SITING PREFERENCES.
   General Design Principles. Every Type II and Type III Wireless
Communications Facility must conform to the following design principles:
      (1)   The proposed wireless facility, its support structure, equipment
and all associated improvements, shall be designed and sited in a manner that
is sympathetic to the particular architectural character of the buildings and
compatible with the streetscape in the vicinity of the proposed project site;
      (2)   Design elements of the proposed wireless facility, its support
structure, equipment and all associated improvements, shall be sensitively
selected to reflect the detailing and materials associated with the buildings
and streetscape in the vicinity of the proposed project site;   
      (3)   The proposed wireless facility, its support structure, equipment
and all associated improvements, shall be designed and sited in a manner that
does not adversely impact right-of-way circulation, accessibility, or obstruct
existing or planned-future uses of the right-of-way; and   
      (4)   The proposed wireless facility shall comply with all applicable
design, construction and location provisions in the Design Guidelines.
   (a)   Design guidelines.  The City of Findlay Engineering Department shall
promulgate additional detailed Design Guidelines for the design and
installation of wireless communications facilities in the right of way, which
the City of Findlay Engineering Department shall consider in reviewing an
application. The Design Guidelines will accord with this section but will
provide greater detail, description, and examples of acceptable wireless
facilities including visual depictions. In addition, the Design Guidelines
shall provide administrative and procedural guidance to applicants such as, for
example, a list of minimum application requirements. The provisions in this
section shall not limit or prohibit the City's discretion to promulgate and
make publicly available other information, materials or requirements in
addition to, and separate from, the Design Guidelines.
   (b)   The Design Guidelines shall be reviewed and approved by the City
Planning Commission before being finalized. The City of Findlay Engineering
Department shall have authority to update or supplement the Design Guidelines
to address relevant changes in law, technology, or administrative processes.
Any revisions to the Design Guidelines that would materially modify the
physical design requirements for wireless facilities to make them more
obtrusive or materially modify the standard and minor review locations for
wireless facilities shall be presented to the City Planning Commission for
review and recommendation at a duly-noticed hearing prior to adoption by the
director. The notice shall be transmitted, at minimum, to all community
councils and any person holding a Wireless ROW Permit under Chapter
939 or having an active permit application for the same. In the event of any
conflict between the Design Guidelines and the standards articulated in this
chapter of the Findlay Codified Ordinances, the language of this chapter takes
precedence over the language of the Design Guidelines.
   (c)   For revisions to the Design Guidelines required to be presented to the
city planning commission under Section
939.08(c), the city shall provide notice of the proposed revisions to all
community councils and any person who holds a permit under this Chapter
939, and shall provide reasonable time (not less than 14 days) for those
persons to review and comment on the proposed modifications.
      (Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.09 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Prevention of Failures and Accidents. Any person who owns a Wireless
Communications Facility sited in the right of way shall at all times employ
ordinary and reasonable care and install and maintain in use nothing less than
the best available technology for preventing failures and accidents which are
likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public.
   (b)   Compliance with Fire Safety and FCC Regulations. Wireless
communications facilities, wires, cables, fixtures, and other equipment shall
be installed and maintained in substantial compliance with the requirements of
the National Electric Code, all FCC, state, and local regulations, and in such
manner that will not interfere with the use of other property.
   (c)   Surety Bond or Equivalent Financial Tool for Cost of Removal. All
owners must procure and provide to the city a bond, or must provide proof of an
equivalent financial mechanism, to ensure compliance with all provisions of
this section. The bond or equivalent financial method must specifically cover
the cost of removal of each Wireless Communications Facility which the owner
installs in the right of way in case the city has to remove or pay for removal
of the wireless facility. Two acceptable alternatives to a bond include a funds
set-aside and a letter of credit.   
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.10 NONCONFORMING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (a)   Any Wireless Communications Facility sited in the right of way that is
legally in existence on the date of the adoption of this chapter but that does
not comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be permitted to remain
in the right of way but shall be considered a nonconforming Wireless
Communications Facility.
   (b)   As of the effective date of the ordinance establishing this chapter,
the owner of the nonconforming facility and the facility itself are subject to
the standard conditions found in Section
939.07 and the maintenance requirements found in Section
939.09 of this Chapter.
   (c)   If a nonconforming Wireless Communications Facility is hereafter
damaged or destroyed beyond repair, any replacement facility must be designed
in accordance with all provisions of this chapter of the Findlay Codified
Ordinances and the Design Guidelines.
   (d)   The provisions in this section shall not be applied to prohibit or
deny any collocation or modification pursuant to a Type I application, as
required by FCC regulations.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.11 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of any part of this chapter are severable. If any provision
or subsection, or the application of any provision or subsection to any person
or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining provisions, subsection, and
applications of such ordinance to other persons or circumstances shall not be
made invalid as well. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
remaining provisions would have been adopted had such invalid provisions not
been included in this chapter when originally adopted by Council.
(Ord. 2017-037. Passed 5-2-17.)
939.12 PENALTIES.
   (a)   Any person who shall erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair,
convert, attach, or maintain any Wireless Communications Facility in violation
of any of the terms of this chapter, or who, being the owner or agent of the
owner of any lot, tract, or parcel of land, shall suffer or permit another to
erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair, convert, attach, or maintain any
such facility, shall be deemed to have violated the provisions hereof and shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. Each day that the violation
continues is a separate and distinct offense.
   (b)   If any Wireless Communications Facility is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, attached, or maintained in
violation of this chapter or of any regulations made pursuant hereto, the
proper officer of the city, in addition to other remedies, may institute in the
name of the city any appropriate action or proceeding, whether by legal process
or otherwise, to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, attachment, or use, to restrain,
correct, or abate such violation, to prevent the use of such facility, and/or
to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about such

to swine or other animals within or without the corporate limits of the City,
as the Board of Health may by resolution designate.
(1979 Code 94.47)
953.04 WASTE NOT THROWN ON STREETS OR OTHER PLACES.
   No person, firm or corporation producing, responsible for or having any

minimum requirements:
   (a)    Location and Arrangement.
      (1)    The proposed subdivision shall conform to the various elements of
the Findlay and Hancock County Comprehensive Land Use Plans and shall be
considered in relation to the existing and planned major and secondary
thoroughfares and such streets shall be platted in the location and width
indicated on such Plan.
      (2)   The street layout shall provide for continuation of secondary
thoroughfares and minor streets in adjoining subdivisions or the proper
projection of streets when adjoining property is not subdivided.
      (3)   The street layout shall include minor streets so laid out that
their use by through traffic shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain an existing or
proposed major or secondary thoroughfare, the Commission shall require marginal
access streets, reverse frontage or such other treatment as may be necessary
for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
traffic and reduction of traffic hazards.
      (5)    Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain a railroad,
expressway or other limited access highway right of way, the Commission may
require the location of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right of way at a distance suitable for the development of the intervening
land. Such distances shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for approach grades to future grade separation.
      (6)    Half streets shall be prohibited, except where absolutely
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
the other requirements of these regulations, and where the Commission finds it
will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is developed. Wherever there exists adjacent to the tract to
be subdivided a dedicated or platted and recorded half street, the other half
shall be platted.
      (7)    Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-
end streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuing street plan, and
only if a temporary turnaround satisfactory to the Commission in design is
provided and provisions for maintenance and removal are advanced. Temporary

      (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1111.03 BLOCKS.
   Blocks within subdivisions shall conform to the following standards:
   (a)   Sizes.
      (1)    Blocks shall not exceed 1,400 feet in length, except where, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, conditions may justify a greater distance.
      (2)    Widths of blocks shall be determined by the condition of the
layout and shall be suited to the intended layout.
   (b)   Public Walkways.
      (1)    Location of public walkways or crosswalks may be required by the
Commission to obtain satisfactory pedestrian access to public or private
facilities or where blocks exceed 900 feet in length.
      (2)    Public walkways shall be in the nature of an easement for this
purpose.
   (c)    Easements.
      (1)    Location of utility line easements shall be provided along the
rear or side lot lines as necessary for utility lines. Easements shall give
access to every lot, park or public grounds. Such easements shall be a total of
not less than fifteen (15) feet wide, seven and one-half (7 ½) feet from each
parcel.
      (2)    Recommendations on the proposed layout of telephone and electric
company easements should be sought from all of the utility companies serving
the area. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to submit copies of
the preliminary plat to all appropriate public utilities.
      (3)    Easements not less than three (3) feet in width shall be provided
where needed alongside lot lines so as to provide for street light dropouts.
Prior to the approval of the final plat for a proposed subdivision, a statement
shall be obtained from the appropriate utility indicating that easements have
been provided along specific lots. A notation shall be made on the final plat
indicating: "The side lot lines between lots (indicating lot numbers) are
subject to street light dropout rights granted to the (name of utility
company)." (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1111.04 LOTS.
   Lots within subdivisions shall conform to the following standards:
   (a)    Sizes and Shapes.
      (1)    The size, width, depth and shape in any subdivision proposed for
residential uses shall be appropriate for the location and the type of
development contemplated.
      (2)    In areas where City or township zoning regulations are in effect,
the lot width and lot area requirements of such zoning regulations shall
control.
      (3)    The following standards shall apply in unincorporated areas where
no zoning regulations are in effect:
         A.    When a subdivision in an unincorporated area is to be connected
to public sanitary sewer facilities or to a community sewage disposal plant,
and when lots in such subdivision are intended for single-family residential
use, all lots shall have a minimum width of sixty-five feet at the building
line and a minimum area of 7,800 square feet.
         B.    Whenever either public or community sewage disposal facilities
are not available, lots intended for single-family residential use shall have a
minimum width of 125 feet and a minimum area of two (2) acres.
         C.    Whenever sanitary sewer facilities are not reasonably accessible
and a community sewage disposal plant is not required, lots shall be increased
in area by 10,000 square feet for each dwelling unit in excess of one.
      (4)   Unless otherwise controlled by City or township zoning regulations,
the minimum front yard setback shall be thirty (30) feet. In the case of a rear
yard abutting a side yard, the side yard setback shall be not less than the
minimum front yard setback required herein, and all regulations applicable to a
front yard shall apply.
      (5)    Corner lots in residential subdivision shall be platted at least
ten (10) feet wider than the minimum width permitted by these regulations or
any applicable zoning regulations.
      (6)    Excessive lot depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A
depth-to- width ratio of three to one shall normally be considered a maximum.
      (7)    Flag lots shall not be less than five (5) acres in area, either in
recorded subdivision plats or as minor subdivisions. In computing the area of a
flag lot, the area of the flag "pole" shall not be included. The area of the
"flag" itself shall be five (5) acres or more. To ensure future access, and
orderly development of land adjoining the parcel, the flag "pole" shall extend
the full depth of the flag lot. Additionally, to ensure the future ability to
utilize the "pole" for access, all improvements or structures shall be set back
from the nearest point of the pole not less than thirty (30) feet. Upon timely
application, in situations where exceptional topographic or other physical
conditions render compliance with the required length of the flag "pole"
impractical, the Planning Commission may grant such variance as may be needed
to affect the spirit and purpose of these regulations.
      (8)    Lots intended for purposes other than residential use shall be
specifically designed for such purposes, and shall have adequate provision for
off- street parking, setbacks and loading and unloading areas.
      (9)    Lots may not be created by dividing land at the ends of stub
streets in adjacent subdivisions, such stub streets being intended to provide
continuity of street systems in adjoining subdivisions.
      (10)    To provide adequate right of way for future public roadways, all
parcels shall be provided not less than sixty (60) feet of frontage on a public
roadway, or on a private roadway that has been approved as part of a record
subdivision plat. In the case of a flag lot, the flag "pole" shall have a width
of sixty feet for its entire length.
   (b)    Arrangement.
      (1)    Every lot shall front or abut a public street, except those
private streets existing prior to January 15, 1963, and which have existed as
easements of access and are so recorded in the records of Hancock County, may
remain as private roadways.
      (2)    Wherever practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles or
radial to the street right-of-way lines.
      (3)    Residential lots abutting major or secondary thoroughfares, where
marginal access streets are not desirable or possible to attain, shall be
platted with reverse frontage lots or with side lot lines parallel to the major
or secondary traffic streets.
      (4)    Lots shall have a front-to-front relationship across all streets
where possible. (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1111.05 NATURAL FEATURES.
   To the greatest extent possible, the natural features and character of land
shall be preserved. Due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as
large trees, natural groves and similar community assets that will add
attractiveness and value to the property, if preserved. The preservation of
drainage and natural stream channels shall be considered by the subdivider and
the dedication and provision of adequate barriers where appropriate shall be
required.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1111.06 FLOOD AREAS AND STORM DRAIN DITCHES.
   (a)    Flood Plain Areas. All subdivisions shall conform to the City flood
damage prevention ordinance or, if in unincorporated territory, to the Hancock
County Flood Damage Prevention Regulations, as approved by the Hancock County
Commissioners on May 9, 1991. Such Regulations are maintained by the Hancock
County Engineer.
   Whenever all or part of a proposed subdivision lies within an area of
special flood hazard as identified in the most recent available mapping
published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), approval of the
subdivision plat shall be conditioned on the following:
      (1)   No encroachment by either fill material or future structures shall
be permitted in the area identified as "floodway" on FEMA mapping.
Modifications of floodway areas shall only be permitted if an engineering
analysis demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City or County Engineer that
such modifications will not result in detrimental impacts either up or
downstream
      (2)   Development within flood hazard areas shall not result in any
decrease in the flood storage capacity of the flood plain area. Therefore, any
subdivision proposed in flood hazard areas shall be accompanied by a grading
plan indicating how land balancing may be achieved, and how all building sites
can be elevated above the base flood elevation for that location.
      (3)    If a subdivision is approved in a flood hazard area, the
subdivider shall be required to post a performance bond guaranteeing execution
of the grading plan. The grading plan shall be executed and the results
certified by an engineer prior to the plat being signed by the City Engineer
and submitted to the County Recorder. The plat shall be accompanied by
restrictive covenants prohibiting the placement of any fill material in areas
lying below the base flood elevation, and the subdivider shall be responsible
for enforcement of the covenants until all lots in the subdivision have been
conveyed to others.
      (4)    Development activities located in areas that are designated as
flood plain areas, including floodway, will require an approval from the City
Local Flood Plain Administrator and shall follow all requirements set forth in
Chapter
1351 of these Codified Ordinances. All engineering analysis submitted to the
City Local Flood Plain Administrator shall be conducted by a state registered
professional engineer.
      (5)   No encroachment by either fill material or future structures shall
be permitted in the area identified as “floodway” on FEMA mapping.
Modifications of floodway areas shall only be permitted if such modifications
follow all requirements found in Section 60.3(d) of the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations and in Chapter
1351 of these Codified Ordinances. Modifications in the floodway shall not
result in any increases in the base flood elevation, also known as 100-year
flood elevation. All engineering analysis that certifies no increase in the
base flood elevation shall extend a distance of one (1) mile upstream and
downstream of the development site to ensure no impact on the 100-year flood
elevation.
   (b)    Areas of Poor Drainage. If a subdivision is located in an area having
poor drainage or other adverse physical characteristics, the Commission may
approve the subdivision provided the subdivider agrees to perform such
improvements as will render the area safe for the intended use. In lieu of the
improvements, the subdivider shall furnish a surety or certified check covering
the cost of the required improvements.
   (c)    Flood Control and Storm Drainage Facilities. Flood control or storm
drainage facilities shall be provided as follows:
      (1)    Access to flood control or storm drainage ditches and channels
shall be by means of easements. Such easements shall be not less than thirty
(30) feet in width, exclusive of the width of the ditch or channel, and an
easement of this type shall be provided on one side of a flood control or storm
drainage ditch, channel or similar type facility.
      (2)    Flood control or storm drainage easements containing underground
facilities shall have a minimum width of ten (10) feet.
      (3)   Whenever a flood control or storm drainage ditch or channel has a
depth of five (5) feet or more, or a bank slope of two (2) feet horizontal to
one (1) foot vertical or steeper, a five (5) foot high masonry wall or chain
link fence may be required by the Commission.
      (4)    The basis for determining storm water conveyance shall be a ten
(10)-year storm. All storm water to be discharged from the platted area shall
be detained based on a 100-year storm volume unless otherwise recommended by
the Chief Engineer and approved by the City Planning Commission. The discharge
rate for all detention-retention areas shall be equal to the five (5) year pre-
developed runoff from the site. Detention- retention calculations shall be
reviewed by the Chief Engineer. All lots within recorded subdivisions shall be
provided positive drainage so as to avoid areas of standing water. Where a
subdivision includes a pond, lake, basin or other physical facilities for storm
water management, the restrictive covenants filed with the plat shall include
measures to assure the continued maintenance of the facilities, placing the
responsibility for maintenance with the owners of property in such subdivision.
      (5)   Provisions shall be made to provide an emergency overflow route,
from the detention areas to the point of discharge, in the event a storm
exceeds the 100-year detention capacity. The overflow route must not adversely
impact adjoining properties.
      (6)    In any subdivision created after the effective date of this
section, the subdivider shall be required to post a performance bond to
guarantee the execution of the detention-retention area plan. The performance
bond shall not be released until the actual conditions, certified by a
professional engineer, are submitted and verified by the Chief Engineer.
         (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1111.07 HIGH PRESSURE GAS, CRUDE AND PRODUCTS LINES.
   Whenever a proposed subdivision is located on land crossed by a high-
pressure gas, crude or products line, the following regulation shall apply:
   (a)   Preliminary Plat. The preliminary plat shall show the location of all
high-pressure gas, crude or products lines.
   (b)    A twenty-five (25) foot easement shall be provided, with the center
line of the easement being the actual pipeline.

1112.03 PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   (a)   Requirements for Underground Wiring. The subdivider shall make
arrangements for all lines for public utility services distributed by
facilities such as wire or cable to be placed underground entirely throughout a
newly subdivided area, except for major or secondary thoroughfare rights-of-
way, and such conduits or cables shall be placed within private easements
provided to such public utility service companies by the developer or within
dedicated public ways; provided, however, that overhead lines may be permitted
within the limits of such newly subdivided area upon approval of the Commission
and Council or the Board of County Commissioners and the County Engineer at the
time of final plat approval where it is determined that overhead lines will not
constitute a detriment to the health, safety, general welfare, plat design and
character of the subdivision. In the event that a public utility company
foresees practical difficulties in complying with the requirements of this
section, such company may petition the Commission for a variance. All such
facilities placed in dedicated public ways shall be planned so as not to
conflict with other underground utilities. All such facilities shall be
constructed in accordance with standards of construction approved by the State.
All drainage and underground public utility installations which traverse
privately owned property shall be protected by easements granted by the
subdivider. The requirements for underground wiring contained in this section
shall also include and require the developer (subdivider) to have the public
utility stub in street light wiring in accordance to the utility's plans and
specifications for said subdivision and shall be done at the time all other
underground wiring is installed by said utility.
   (b)   Storm Drainage System and Other Drainage Improvements. Per details and
specifications approved by Council or the Board of County Commissioners,
depending upon jurisdiction.
   (c)    Sewage Disposal. Per details and specifications approved by Council

of way adjacent to the subdivision being developed, and such walks shall be
located one foot from the property line. In areas outside the City's corporate
limits, and in the event no good purpose would be served by the provision of
sidewalks, this requirement may be waived by mutual consent of the Planning
Commission and the Board of County Commissioners.
   (b)   Public Walkways. Walkways shall be at least six (6) feet in width.
Fences and other improvements may also be required if the Commission determines
they are necessary to protect the adjacent property owners.
   (c)    Street Signs. Street name signs shall be placed at all street
intersections and shall be of a permanent weather resistant construction with
the street names visible from two directions, as approved by the City or County
Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction. Traffic regulation signs, as may be
required, shall be located as required by the Traffic Commission and/ or

   The City’s zoning districts may be further defined through restrictions
imposed by one or more of the following Overlay Districts:
   (a)   “MOD” Medical Overlay District. The Medical Overlay District promotes
medical and related uses associated with a primary care point such as a
hospital. The district allows for a mix of uses supporting the primary care
point while protecting the property in the vicinity from more intrusive uses
allowable in other use districts.
   (b)   “ROD” Riparian Overlay District.  Setbacks along watercourses,
including rivers, streams, major and minor tributaries to serve as buffer
areas. The District is prepared and adopted in preparation of the Flood
Mitigation effort underway to minimize or reduce flooding of the Blanchard
River and its tributaries. Once the mitigation effort is complete, the overlay
district shall be designated on the zoning map. One example would be seventy-
five feet (75’) setbacks both sides of the Blanchard River and twenty-five feet
(25’) both sides of Eagle Creek.
   (c)   “UOD” University Overlay District.  The University Overlay District
promotes educational and related uses associated with secondary education
institutions such as a university or community college. The Overlay District
permits educational institutions and their accessory uses, as well as a variety
of local commercial uses typically associated with and nearby a university or
college, to enhance the campus existence but protect the area from more
intrusive uses allowable in commercial districts. (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-
23.)
1119.03 ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   The boundaries of zoning districts are shown upon the Zoning District Map
which is made a part of this Zoning Ordinance, which is designated as the
"Zoning District Map." The Zoning District Map and all notations, references
and other information shown thereon are a part of this Ordinance and have the
same force and effect as if the Zoning District Map and all the notations,
references and other information shown thereon were fully set forth or
described herein, of which the original Zoning District Map is properly
attested and is on file with the City Council.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1119.04 RESPECT TO OTHER LOCAL REGULATIONS.
   The intent of this Zoning Ordinance is to coordinate, cross reference, and
respect other local government regulations where they apply in specific
instances as much as possible. The various regulations incorporated by
reference herein include but may not be limited to:
   (a)   Findlay Municipal Code Chapter
1351 “Flood Damage Reduction Ordinance” Restricts or prohibits certain land
uses within the 100-year flood plain as defined by the Flood Hazard Boundary
Map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Administration for the City of
Findlay.
   (b)   Findlay Municipal Code Chapter
1105 Subdivision Rules and Regulations Establishes requirements for creating
lots, or parcels and establishing the review and decision-making process.
   (c)   Hancock County Access Management Regulations. Establishes policies for
the unincorporated area of Hancock County to allow access onto county and
township roadways. A county roadway classification system is identified along
with related distance requirements between access points.
      (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1119.05 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Zoning District Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Roadways.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such
centerlines.
   (b)   Lot Lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot
lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.
   (c)   Municipal Limits.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following
municipal limits shall be construed as following municipal limits.
   (d)   Railroads. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be
construed to be located in the centerline or the midway (if multiple) between
the main tracks.
   (e)   Shorelines. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be
construed to follow the centerline of streams, rivers, lakes, or other bodies
of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines and in the event of a
natural change in the watercourse way shall be construed to follow such
centerlines.
   (f)   Map Interpretations.  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or
extensions of features indicated in subsections (a) through (e) above shall be
so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official Zoning
District Map shall be determined by the scale of the Map.
   (g)   Interpretations and Discrepancies. Where physical or natural features
existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official Zoning
District Map, or in other circumstances not covered by subsections (a) through
(f) above, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall interpret the District boundaries.
   (h)   Extend to Centerlines. Insofar as some or all of the various Districts
may be indicated on the Zoning District Map by patterns which, for the sake of
map clarity, do not cover public rights-of-way, it is intended that such
District boundaries do extend to the center of any public right-of-way.
      (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1119.06 ZONING OF VACATED AREAS.

or portion thereof shall automatically be classified in the same Zoning
District as the property to which it attaches.

   The C-3 Downtown Business District is designed to distinguish the area as
unique from all other business district areas in the City. The unique
characteristics include closer massing of buildings, taller buildings,
pedestrian-friendly walkways; numerous uses to co-exist that are prohibited in
other districts; using the City’s rights-of-ways for outdoor dining, sidewalk
sales, and exhibits; lack of required setbacks; and lack of parking
requirements.
   The C-3 Downtown Business District is the most open zoning district and
allows the mixing of uses that other zoning districts do not permit. Creative
parking arrangements are encouraged but not required. Absent any parking
requirements, there cannot be an expectation to provide ample curbside parking
in front of each business door, nor can there be a code standard cited as
reason for creating surface parking lots in place of existing buildings.

CHAPTER 1139
Downtown Design Review District Review Guidelines
1139.01   Introduction.
1139.02   Design guidelines.
1139.03   Secretary of the Interior standards.
1139.04   Appendix.
1139.01 INTRODUCTION.
   The City of Findlay has adopted the following design guidelines for the
Downtown Design Review District. This booklet is designed to give property
owners and developers a sense of the criteria utilized in reviewing projects
for appropriateness. The guide is not a set of regulations set-in-stone but
rather a tool to help visualize and convey the design goals and character of
the Downtown Design Review District.
   The Downtown Design Review District, as adopted by the City of Findlay,
encompasses the geographic area highlighted on the zoning map.
   (a)   Role. The Downtown Design Guidelines comprise the minimum design
criteria and range of performance guidelines suggested for the overlay
district, which exemplify the design direction that the City of Findlay
recommends as appropriate. Additionally, the Downtown Design Review Board will
encourage property owners to preserve the historic character of their building.
The role of the Design Guidelines is different from the more precise
regulations found in the zoning code. The Design Guidelines:
      (1)   Do not dictate specific limits, nor does strict adherence to them
necessarily assures approval of an application;
      (2)   Are not rigid sets of rules, but rather a guide on how to make
improvements in the overlay district which are compatible with its character;
      (3)   Give building owners advice on how to undertake work in the
district, and they give the Design Review Board a way to determine whether the
proposed work is appropriate; and
      (4)   Set broad parameters within which changes should occur in order to
achieve business and economic development, while maintaining many opportunities
for design creativity and individual choices and tastes.
   (b)   Purpose.  The purpose of the Design Guidelines is to help owners to
make improvements consistent with the scale, form and character of the
downtown. This, in turn, will help to promote economic development, business
expansion, and residential opportunities in the area. These guidelines are also
in place to protect the significant public and private investment that has
occurred downtown.
   (c)   Design Review Process. As stated in the City of Findlay Downtown
Design Review District Ordinance, the Design Review Board shall review all
exterior façade alterations, additions, and new construction within the
Downtown Design Review District. Repairs and alterations or other modifications
not visible from the street or alley shall not be reviewed.
      How does the process begin?
The recommended first step in the Design Review process is a pre-application
meeting between the applicant and the Design Review Board Administrator. After
a preliminary review of the applicant's proposal, the Administrator will
determine if the project can be approved administratively or if it should go
before the Design Review Board.
      How is a decision made to approve or deny an application?
      (1)   When the property owner or occupant/tenant intends to construct,
reconstruct, or alter any portion of a structure within the district, they
shall first apply for and secure a Certificate of Appropriateness from the
Design Review Board. The application for a certificate shall be deposited with
the Design Review Board Administrator, together with such plans, specifications
and drawings needed to convey the scope of the project. The application must
contain the following:
         A.   Completed Application Form.
         B.   Application fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
         C.   Photographs of existing conditions.
         D.   Colored drawings of proposed project showing all exposed façades
of the building.
         E.   List of materials to be used in the project including proposed
colors.
      (2)   The Administrator shall transmit the application to the Design
Review Board Members.
      (3)   Within forty-five (45) days of filing, the Board shall consider the
application package and approve, deny, or table the application. Review of the
application shall be based on Design Review Guidelines contained in this
document.
      (4)   If the Board fails to meet and consider an application within
forty-five days of filing, the application shall be deemed approved. Once the
Board meets to consider the application the forty-five (45) day period is
satisfied and no specific timeline is applied to the application. The Board may
table an application for further discussion or factfinding purposes.
      (5)   The Board may require any person applying for a Certificate of
Appropriateness to supply additional information with the Board prior to any
hearing or determination to properly review the request.
      (6)   If the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration is
determined to have no adverse effect on the Downtown Design Review District,
and does not violate the spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the
Board Administrator shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (7)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed
construction, reconstruction, Alteration will have an adverse effect on the
Downtown Design Review District, or violates the spirit and purposes of these
guidelines, then the Board shall deny issuance of the Certificate of
Appropriateness. The Board shall state in its records the reason for denial and
transmit to the Applicant via proof of mailing the reasons for denial.

Figure 1.01 District Boundary Map: The Design Review Board Guidelines apply to
the buildings within the outlined Downtown Design Review District overlay.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 5-19-23.)
1139.02 DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   These design guidelines help convey the desired architectural quality and
design for the Downtown Design Review District. These guidelines are used by
the Design Review Board to help guide the decision-making process.
   (a)   General Building Design. The purpose of the Design Review Guidelines
is not to define a specific style or period of architecture. Instead, the
Design Review Guidelines are intended to encourage alterations, renovations and
new construction which are distinctive in character, aesthetically pleasing and
built of lasting quality.
      (1)   In general, buildings in the Downtown Design Review District
should:
         A.   Have a singular architectural style.
         B.   Use durable, high-quality materials.
         C.   Preserve historic buildings or details when feasible.
         D.   Use neutral color schemes.
         E.   Be pedestrian friendly.
         F.   Create or maintain a unified street wall.
         G.   Incorporate landscaping and greenspace when possible.
         H.   Give equal emphasis to all exposed façades.
         I.   Have a compatible or complimentary architectural design to its
neighbors.
         J.   Utilize signage designed for pedestrians.
         K.   Hide mechanical equipment from view.
      (2)   Buildings should not:
         A.   Mix several architectural styles.
         B.   Use bright, florescent, shiny, reflective paint or materials.
         C.   Lack architectural features
         D.   Use cheap, low-quality materials.
         E.   Have one-sided architecture.
      (3)   The Design Review Board will review each applicant based upon their
compliance with the following design objectives:
         A.   Building Massing.
         B.   Building Materials.
         C.   Building Façade.
         D.   Windows.
         E.   Entrances.
         F.   Awnings.
         G.   Signage.
         H.   Lighting.
         I.   Colors.
         J.   Site Improvements.
         K.   Fencing.
         L.   Parking Lots.
         M.   Landscaping.
         N.   Mechanical Systems.
Applicants should ensure that the Design Guidelines have been considered in
their application. Failure to consider all aspects of the Design Guidelines may
result in a denial of the application.
   (b)   Building Massing.  The physical qualities of massing, scale, and form
help to determine whether buildings are sensible to their context. Traditional
Main Street commercial buildings have demonstrated physical qualities that make
them proportionate to the street space and appropriate to the pedestrian scale.
Generally, buildings are two (2) to five (5) stories tall, and built to the lot
line and form a continuous frontage on Main Street. Overall, these buildings
demonstrate proportions, rhythm, and details that are traditional in character.
In addition, the overall building design is important to create a sense of
place, enclosure, and activity. The following guidelines are offered:
      (1)   Building massing, height, and lot coverage should be proportionate
to adjacent buildings. Appropriate massing will assist in creating a sense of
enclosure.
      (2)   Primary façades should be located near the right-of-way line.
Buildings located at the street edge enhance both the urban quality of the
street and the pedestrian experience. Conversely, buildings set back away from
the right-of-way detract from the urban experience and should be avoided.
      (3)   Buildings should extend and establish a continual street wall.
      (4)   Plazas and outdoor cafes are encouraged as they continue street
wall whereas parking lots are discouraged as they eliminate the street wall.
      (5)   Single-story buildings should be avoided along the major corridors.
The size, spacing, and location of neighboring buildings may allow for single-
story buildings in some cases.

Figure 2.02: Inappropriate building massing - too much variation in height does
not present uniform street front. Of most concern is the single-story building
which deteriorates the sense of enclosure.

Figure 2.03 Building height, street width ratio: This illustrates a good design
criterion that is the street width to building height ratio (1:3 Building
heights to street width). Maintaining this ratio helps create the urban sense
of enclosure.

   (c)   Building Materials.  Building façade materials are essential elements
that tie the building to its surroundings and visually impact the surrounding
environment. In addition to other design features, traditional façade materials
allow buildings to appear suitable and harmonious to their context while other
materials can appear distracting.
      (1)   Base materials should be consistent and new materials should
complement the existing.
      (2)   Repair and restoration of original features and materials such as
brick, stone, wood siding, etc. is highly encouraged. Covering original
features and materials, however, is discouraged.
      (3)   Building materials such as utility brick, concrete masonry units,
and Exterior Insulating Finishing Systems (EIFS) as a primary façade material
are discouraged but may be used as accent materials.
      (4)   Building materials such as brick, stone, manufactured stone, terra
cotta accents, metal accents, and wood are encouraged as they provide visual
interest and assist in creating a pedestrian friendly corridor.
      (5)   A horizontal expression should establish the ground level of the
building from the rest of the building. The expression should complement
adjacent buildings and reinforce the street as a pedestrian friendly space.
      (6)   Materials should be used to differentiate between the importance of
building features and provide visual separations between material functions.

Figure 2.08 Discouraged Materials: Discouraged - utility masonry
   (d)   Building Façade. Features that extend out from the building façade can
contribute to the character, scale, and visual interest of the street.
      (1)   Consider entire blocks as a single façade - use similar or
complementary materials, colors, elements to create a unified appearance.
      (2)   Façades should reflect proportionate shapes and patterns.
Unarticulated walls create poor visual appearance, and do not relate to the
base or the roof.
      (3)   Façades should be visually appealing through detailing, openings,
and materials.
      (4)   Corner buildings are buildings exposed on two (2) streets. Corners
of these buildings should be articulated and elaborated to reflect this
importance.
      (5)   There should be a clearly defined top, middle, and base seen on the
outside.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d569dcd37a21a73e8765743d2b9acf9ad2694a08/

Figure 2.10 Discouraged Façade: These figures illustrate poor design through
lack of detail, poorly spaced windows and doors, no sense of top, middle, and
base, and minimal variation in materials and brick color.

Figure 2.11 Encouraged Façade: Another example of encouraged façade design
styles. Again, we see complementary materials, well-patterned building
openings, and a variety of architectural details.
   
   (e)   Windows.
      (1)   Ground floor windows should be designed to encourage retail uses.
Generally, the majority of the first floor should be windows as they enliven
the streets and provide both interest and activity at the street level.
      (2)   Knee walls are encouraged to provide a strong base. They should be
between twelve (12) - thirty (30) inches tall.
      (3)   Windows should be transparent, not opaque.
      (4)   Blocked in windows should be opened up and restored to the original
appearance.
   (5)   Avoid altering the shape of the original openings.
      (6)   If window replacements are necessary, the new windows should convey
the same visual appearance as the originals.
      (7)   Replacement windows should fill the entire historic window opening.
If historic window openings require closing, the opening should be a different
material or texture to maintain the rhythm of the wall.
      (8)   Painting aluminum window (and door) frames can help to blend them
with the building.
      (9)   Upper story windows should be in rhythm with the base level.
      (10)   Sills, lintels, divided lights, and style can create visual
interest. Double-hung windows provide more visual interest than casement
windows.

Figure 2.16: Encouraged Storefront- Knee walls and windows making up the
majority of the storefront demonstrate a strong base.
   
   (f)   Entrances.  A building entrance serves both building tenants and
customers. In addition, it can enliven the building's context. A city block
with buildings with entrances directly accessible from the public sidewalk
encourages pedestrian traffic and increases possibilities for more activities -
shopping and social interactions.
      (1)   Entries should be prominent features of the base. They should be
different from the standard building bay through articulation, elaboration, and
materials.
      (2)   Entrances should be easily recognizable to the pedestrian.
      (3)   If possible, commercial buildings should not use residential doors.
      (4)   There are a variety of ways to enunciate the entryway to a
building:
         A.   Arched entries.
         B.   Recessed entries - two (2) feet from surrounding façade.
         C.   Projecting entries.
         D.   Decorative molding above doorways
         E.   Columns.
         F.   Signage.
         G.   Planters with ornamental landscaping.
         H.   Oversized doors.

Figure 2.18: Discouraged Entryway - Opaque windows, and windows that do not
make up the majority of the storefront give the appearance of a residential
entryway rather than an entryway
of a commercial building.
   (g)   Awnings. Awnings, canopies and marquees serve many functions, and
enhance building façades and sidewalks. They provide store entrances and
sidewalks with a sun-screening element, and a shelter from the rain. They unify
the building appearance, articulate the storefront and entryways, and provide a
surface to place a business name. Careful design and integration with the
building façade design are important considerations to prevent clutter and
façade distractions.
      (1)   Awnings create visual interest while shielding pedestrians from
weather. They should be compatible in both material and style with adjacent
properties. Awnings may have advertised goods and provide visual cues to the
location of the entrance.
      (2)   Awnings should not obscure the architectural features of the
building and should reinforce the frame of the storefront.
      (3)   Awnings should be in proper scale with the building.
      (4)   Awning material should be compatible with building materials and
style.
      (5)   Canvas or metal are generally suitable materials for awnings
      (6)   Plastic, backlit awnings, and shiny or bubble awnings should be
avoided.
      (7)   Scale of signage on awnings should be minimal.
      (8)   Simple, flat-sloped awnings are encouraged.

Figure 2.21: Discouraged Backlit Awning - Plastic backlit awnings are not
appropriate.
   (h)   Signage.  Signs and communication are necessary but sometimes
unattractive components of business operations. It is important to reach a
visual balance between drawing pedestrian attention, and creating an attractive
area free of visual clutter by integrating signage into the overall design of
the building/storefront.
      (1)   Projecting signs create visual interest and can assist businesses
in advertising.
      (2)   Signs should fit existing features of the façade and not cover
major architectural elements.
      (3)   Signs should be mounted somewhere above the display windows and
below the second story windows.
      (4)   It is recommended that window signs do not exceed thirty percent
(30%) of the total glass area of the window.
      (5)   Remove unused/outdated signs and repair any holes resulting from
the removal of the sign(s).
      (6)   Signage should be scaled to pedestrian use within district.
      (7)   Signage should complement the building character.
      (8)   Back-lit box signs should be avoided.
      (9)   Freestanding signs should be temporary and used only for special
events. Permission from the Zoning Officer may have to be obtained before using
freestanding signs.

Figure 2.24: Encouraged Projecting Sign - Projecting signs help to create
visual interest
   (i)   Lighting.
      (1)   Protruding light fixtures also add visual interest while
highlighting building details.
      (2)   Any lighting should minimize glaring and light trespassing.
Lighting near mixed-use buildings should not have a direct impact on upper
story residential windows.
      (3)   Lighting shall complement retail display and nighttime activities.
      (4)   Signs with opaque backgrounds should be lit from the exterior by
wall-mounted, focused, directional lights. The lighting exposure should be
limited as to illuminate the sign content.
      (5)   Neon lighting should be minimal and restricted to "Open" signage
visible through the street level windows only. Strobe lighting is not
permitted.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d569dcd37a21a73e8765743d2b9acf9ad2694a08/
IMAGES/0-0-0-12952_5169x3860.jpg]
   (j)   Color.  Within traditional main streets, neutral and subtle colors are
considered more contextual or pleasing than high intensity, metallic or
fluorescent colors. Colors and finishes that enhance the collective image of
traditional main streets are contextual, which reflect tasteful and responsible
artistic expressions.
The City does not have a required color palate for the Downtown Design Review
District but the color selection process should fit the character of the
downtown.
      (1)   Bright fluorescent colors should be avoided.
      (2)   Brighter and darker hues should be used sparingly for smaller
accent features or to draw attention to details, such as a door.
      (3)   Colors should accentuate architectural details of the building.
      (4)   Color schemes should be simple, using the minimum number of colors
necessary to achieve a desired look.
      (5)   The color selection should complement the predominate hues of the
adjoining buildings.
      (6)   If masonry must be painted, select colors that are similar to the
natural range of the brick.
      (7)   Stripes, polka dots, checkerboard patterns and other distracting
paint combinations are discouraged.
      (8)   Neutrals, earth tones, and natural materials of both low
reflectance and subdued shades are encouraged.
      (9)   Building colors should be consistent on all sides.
      (10)   Appropriate color palettes are noted in the Appendix.
   (k)   Site Improvements.
      (1)   Fencing.  Fencing around a building or site can serve many
functions. It can mark boundaries, provide screening, control entry and exit,
and to provide a form of security. Security fencing around a commercial
establishment can portray defensiveness toward the pedestrian and negatively
impact neighboring properties. Although there are not many fences within the
downtown, there are cases in which they are appropriate. Special consideration
should be given to the type of fencing used.
         A.   The following types of fencing are discouraged:
            i.    Chain link
            ii.    Wood privacy
            iii.    Vinyl fencing
            iv.    Split rail fencing
         B.   The following is encouraged:
            i.    Metal wrought iron fencing
            ii.    Masonry walls   
            iii.    Combination of masonry wall and metal wrought iron fencing

Figure 2.26: Appropriate Fencing - fencing material can create a more inviting
appearance.
      (2)   Parking Lots. Parking lots consume vital land, separate buildings
from public sidewalks, break up continuity of the street wall and can be
visually intrusive if not screened and landscaped appropriately. Consideration
for physical qualities like appropriate building sitting, building site
relationship, landscaping and screening elements not only reduces the negative
visual impact of parking lots, but also improves the walkability, livability
and safety of the main streets.
         A.   Parking lots should be set back from the street lot line or the
back or the sidewalk.
         B.   Locate parking lots behind buildings as close as possible to rear
entrances.
         C.   Large, paved areas for off-street parking should be screened with
walls, fencing, or plants.
         D.   Concrete curbs are the appropriate edges for the parking lot.
Avoid blocks or bumpers.

Figure 2.27: Appropriate Parking Lots - Good example of parking lot
      (3)   Landscaping. Landscaping can provide visual appeal and
environmental comfort. It improves both the appearance and property value while
instilling confidence and pride in the area. Landscape design works with a
variety of elements that include water, screening, fencing, lighting, as well
as hard (non-living elements.) and soft surfaces (living elements). Trees, when
appropriately located, provide shade and windbreak, and help to create a
pedestrian-friendly environment.
         A.   Landscaping can create pedestrian friendly sidewalks by
separating vehicles from pedestrians. Benches adjacent to landscape areas
assist in creating pedestrian friendly spaces.
         B.   Dead or dying plant material should be removed and replaced as
needed.
         C.   Avoid plastic of artificial plant material.
         D.   Trees can serve as a buffer between pedestrians and the road as
well as help with screening sun and wind exposure.
         E.   Trees should be in scale with their surroundings and planted so
as not to impede with pedestrian traffic flow.
         F.   Trees should be deep rooted to avoid upheaval of the sidewalks.
         G.   Tree should be selected to fit the climate, soil type, and
environment for which they are planted.
         H.   Façades can be enlivened by the addition of hanging plants.
Hanging plants, however, must not impede pedestrian traffic.
         I.   Window planters are also recommended to enhance the greenery of
the streetscape.
         J.   Landscaping can be used to soften fencing as noted in Section
2.04.1 above.
Figure 2.28: Appropriate Landscaping - Good example of parking lot
      (4)   Mechanical Systems.
         A.   AC units distended from windows are not allowed.
         B.   New mechanical systems/additional mechanical services should be
placed out of the line of sight when possible.
         C.   Special precautions should be taken when installing new
mechanical systems in older buildings to ensure that both the interior/exterior
of the building is preserved.
         D.   Rooftop units visible from the street shall be screened from
pedestrian view with a material in keeping with the architecture of the
building.
            (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1139.03 SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR STANDARDS.
   The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and
Historic Preservation, which are included in this document, are intended to
provide technical advice about archeological and historic preservation
activities and methods. These standards, however, are not
regulatory and do not set or interpret agency policy. These are encouraged
activities and practices, but may not be suitable or practical for all projects
within the design district.
   (a)   Standards for Preservation.
      (1)   A property will be used as it was historically, or be given a new
use that maximizes the retention of distinctive materials, features, spaces,
and spatial relationships. Where a treatment and use have not been identified,
a property will be protected and, if necessary, stabilized until additional
work may be undertaken.
      (2)   The historic character of a property will be retained and
preserved. The replacement of intact or repairable historic materials or
alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a
property will be avoided.
      (3)   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate, and conserve existing
historic materials and features will be physically and visually compatible,
identifiable upon close inspection, and properly documented for future
research.
      (4)   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in
their own right will be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be
preserved.
      (6)   The existing condition of historic features will be evaluated to
determine the appropriate level of intervention needed. Where the severity of

1151.06   Definitions.
1151.01 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
   (a)   Purpose. In some cases, the standard zoning district regulations do
not adequately regulate or enable the range of uses in a single zoning district
that are appropriate in the city.
      (1)   The purposes of the PUD regulations are to:
         A.   Provide an opportunity for a mix of land uses otherwise not
permitted within the standard municipal zoning district classifications.
         B.   Enable greater review of design characteristics to ensure that
the development project is properly integrated into its surroundings and is
compatible with adjacent development.
         C.   Assure compatibility between proposed land uses within and around
the PUD through appropriate development controls.
         D.   Promote economical and efficient use of land and reduce
infrastructure costs through unified development.
         E.   Allow for innovated design
   (b)   Application. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations combine
the request for zoning with the development plan review process, and when
applicable, the subdivision process.
      (1)   Each PUD shall be considered a separate and unique zoning district
wherein a preliminary development plan, including associated text depicting the
specific development standards, is adopted simultaneously with the amendment of
the zoning map.
      (2)   PUDs adopted and established in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and the requirements contained herein shall take precedence over
any conflicting regulations contained in the Zoning Code and Subdivision
Regulations.
   
   (c)   Ownership. All property owners shall be a party to the PUD
Application. The PUD shall be binding upon the owners, their successors and
assigns and shall limit and control the issuance and validity of all
certificates of zoning compliance.
   (d)   Size.
      (1)   Minimum size for a PUD is five (5) acres.
      (2)   The five (5) acres requirement may be waived if the project is
considered an infill development.
      (3)   The City Planning Commission shall determine if a development is
considered infill.
         A.   General Criteria the planning shall consider when determining
infill designation:
            i.    The area is unused or underutilized compared to the
surrounding land.
            ii.    Previously or currently has dilapidated or vacant
structures.
            iii.    Utilizes existing infrastructure.

CHAPTER 1155
Riparian Corridor Overlay District
1155.01   Purpose.
1155.02   Intent.
1155.03   Riparian areas defined.
1155.04   Prohibited activities.
1155.05   Area, yard and height regulations.
1155.06   Riparian setback.
1155.07   Exemptions.
1155.08   Standards and regulations.
1155.09   Permitted uses.
1155.10   Exceptions.
1155.01 PURPOSE.
   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses contributes to the health and safety of the residents of
the City of Findlay. The specific purpose and intent of the Riparian Corridor
Overlay District is to regulate land use and construction within riparian areas
to:
   (a)   Impact Reduction. Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows,
slowing the velocity of floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
   (b)   Watercourse Stabilization.  Stabilize the banks of watercourses to
reduce bank erosion and then downstream transport of sediments eroded from
watercourse banks.
   (c)   Pollutant Reduction. Reduction of pollutants in watercourses during
periods of high flows by filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants in
runoff before they enter watercourses.
   (d)   Habitat.  Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining
diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
   (e)   Improve City Economy. Benefit the City economically by minimizing
encroachment on watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering
solutions such as dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures by
reducing property damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents and
by preserving the character and property values of the City.
      (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1155.02 INTENT.
   It is the policy of the City of Findlay to encourage the establishment of
naturally vegetated riparian setbacks along watercourses. Property owners who
own land beside watercourses are encouraged to assume responsibility for
helping to maintain water quality and the environmental health of riparian
systems within the City of Findlay. Riparian setback requirements defined
herein represent only minimal protection to water quality, and property owners
are encouraged to do more to protect the ecological health of waterways.
   Setbacks along watercourses, including rivers, streams, major and minor
tributaries, serve as buffer areas. The district has prepared and adopted plans
in preparation of the Flood Mitigation effort underway to minimize or reduce
flooding of the Blanchard River and its tributaries. Once the mitigation effort
is complete, the overlay district should be designated on the zoning map.
   As an overlay zone, this zoning district imposes additional development
standards for new construction beyond those of the underlying zoning district.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1155.03 RIPARIAN AREAS DEFINED.
   (a)   Streams.  Streams include rivers, creeks and ditches and appear on at
least one of the following maps: USGS topographical map, or soils maps located
in the Soil Survey for Hancock County, Ohio, USDA, and NRCS.
   (b)   100 Year Floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be defined by FEMA
Flood Insurance Rate Map as adopted by the City of Findlay.
   (c)   Permitted/Conditionally Permitted. Permitted and conditionally
permitted uses in the underlying zoning district(s) are allowed except for
those identified as prohibited uses in Section
 1155.04. (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1155.04 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES.
   Additionally, the following activities are prohibited:

1161.01 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES.
1161.01.1 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES R-1, R-2, R-3 & R-4 SINGLE FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   The following standards shall apply to the following zoning districts: R-1,
R-2, R-3, R-4
   (a)   Permitted Accessory Structures. The following accessory structures
shall be permitted and require a zoning permit:
      (1)   Buildings or structures such as detached garages.
      (2)   Gazebos, decks, and hot tub enclosures.
      (3)   Carports, pool houses and greenhouses.
      (4)   Sheds, Swimming Pools.
      (5)   Fences.
      (6)   Sauna.
   (b)   Permitted No Zoning Permit Required.
      (1)   Structures with a building footprint of fifty square feet (50 sq
ft) or less. No such structures are permitted in any front yard.
      (2)   Wheel Chair ramps (Exempt from Section
1161.01.1(c)(3)) Restricted in front yard.
      (3)   Commercial storage containers are permitted on a property not to
exceed sixty (60) days in a calendar year and must be situated on a site so as
not to create a visibility hazard. Exemptions may be granted by the Zoning
Administrator in the event of a calamity.
   (c)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Accessory structures shall comply with the following requirements:
Relationship to Primary Use: Shall be customarily incidental, accessory and
subordinate to, and commonly associated with the primary use and occupant of
the same parcel. Owners of multiple, contiguous parcels that desire treatment
as though they are a single lot must combine the parcels with a new legal
description and deed at the Hancock County Auditor’s Office. Proof of a
recorded deed must be provided as part of the application.
Example: This requirement prevents a property owner of multiple parcels from
erecting an accessory structure on a separate, vacant but recorded lot that
could eventually be sold and thus become an illegal non-conforming use and lot
under Chapter
1162 Nonconformity Sections 2 – 5.
      (2)   Maximum Floor Area. The combined building footprint of all
accessory buildings on site shall not exceed nine hundred square feet (900 sq.
ft.) One accessory building that is fifty square feet (50 sq. ft.) or less
shall be exempt from this requirement. In no instance shall any separate
accessory building be larger than nine hundred square feet (900 sq. ft.).
Unless the lot equals or exceeds one (1) acre in size the maximum floor area
cannot exceed twelve hundred square feet (1,200 sq. ft.) or eighty percent
(80%) of the primary structure footprint whichever is less. All accessory
buildings are subject to maximum lot coverage requirements as prescribed in
each zoning district. The following stipulations apply to properties without an
attached garage:
         A.   One (1) accessory building used for the parking of vehicles up to
five hundred seventy-six square feet (576 sq. ft.) shall not count against the
total allowable accessory building area. The accessory building used for the
parking of vehicles that is greater than five hundred seventy-six square feet
(576 sq. ft.) will have that area in excess of five hundred seventy-six square
feet (576 sq. ft.) deducted from the maximum allowable accessory building area.
Example: If the property contains a seven hundred square foot (700 sq. ft.)
accessory building for the parking of vehicles, one hundred twenty-four square
feet (124 sq ft.) of area of excess are deducted from any proposed accessory
building, thereby limiting the size of a new accessory building to seven
hundred seventy-six square feet (776 sq. ft.) in area.
         B.   An existing accessory building used for the parking of vehicles
that is less than five hundred seventy-six square feet (576 sq. ft.), can be
increased in area so the total building area does not exceed five hundred
seventy-six square feet (576 sq. ft.), even if the property contains other
accessory buildings that exceed the nine hundred square foot (900 sq. ft.)
limit. Maximum lot coverage requirements will still apply.
      (3)   Restricted in Front Yard Requirement. No accessory structure shall
be permitted in the required front yard.
      (4)   Conversions. Permanently attaching any accessory building to a
primary building shall be considered a conversion and shall be subject to all
required setbacks for primary structures. These connections must include a four
feet (4’) width building footprint, must be enclosed, have doorways on either
side, and have a foundation.
Example: A detached garage on a street side yard is proposed to be attached to
the primary building with a breezeway. The garage is located in R-3 Single
Family and is five feet (5’) from the property line. In this instance the
conversion would violate the setback required for primary structures and
applicant would not be issued a zoning permit.
      (5)   Storage containers, box truck components, and tractor-trailers are
not considered as buildings and shall not be used as accessory buildings unless
otherwise provided.
      (6)   If an accessory structure is being used for parking/storing of any
vehicle/automobile, the access must be paved with a hard surface from property
line to structure.
   (d)   Setbacks.
      (1)   Front Yard Setback - Accessory structures shall not encroach upon
the required front setback of the lot on which they are located, except fences
and decks.
      (2)   Side and Rear Setbacks - Accessory structures may not be located
closer than three feet (3’) of the side yard and five feet (5’) of the rear
yard.
      (3)   Screening - In no case shall an accessory structure encroach upon
any required screening.

(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.02 ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
1161.02.1 PURPOSE.
   To promote the design and construction of new buildings that support and
enhance character within the City of Findlay. The following standards are
introductory minimums in comparison to standards adopted in many other
communities with a high quality of living. The proposed standards should be
viewed as a starting point for improving the architectural character of the
City’s commercial districts. The standards are only proposed for Multi-Family
Residential Districts, Office and Institutional Districts, and Local and
General Business Districts. Standards are suggested herein to regulate
rooflines on large buildings, to prescribe exterior materials, and to assure
four-sided architectural design. The standards will help to establish a
community-wide architectural quality. Standards should continuously be
developed later to establish architectural compatibility between new
construction and the existing built environment.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.02.2 TERMS.
   To incorporate architectural standards, it is necessary to establish a few
base terms in this zoning chapter:
   (a)   Articulation.  Enhancements prescribed vertically or horizontally
across building façade or roof.
   (b)   Bays. A square unit of measurement used for designing architectural
features and materials proportionate to building facades.
   (c)   Primary Facades.  The prominent façade is the building front and has a
main entryway. It typically faces the main street that provides vehicular
access to the site. Signage indicating the business name and entrance may or
may not exist on this façade. Primary facades on all nonresidential buildings
shall be articulated both vertically and horizontally to relate the structure
to the human-scale.
   (d)   Visible Secondary Façades. Visible secondary facades are visible from
public rights-of-way, public areas or residential areas and shall have a clear
base, middle, and top portion emphasized by the articulation to a human-scale.
Visible secondary façades should incorporate a variety of architectural design
features, techniques, patterns, materials and colors in a coordinated manner
that relate to the overall design of the structure. (See Figure 1161.2 – 1)
   (e)   Secondary Façades. Secondary facades face other secondary facades of
nonresidential buildings and are not visible from adjacent residential or
public areas. Secondary façades or portions of secondary façades completely
screened from public or residential areas by dense landscaping or other
structures shall not be required to include elements of articulation.
   (f)   Vertical Articulation (Figure 1161.2-1). Vertical articulation is used
to present the appearance of a clerestory, half-story, or multiple full stories
through one of the following methods:
      (1)   Exterior demarcation of the floors within, using a change in
building materials, masonry patterns, or windows. (Figure 1161.2 – 1 Vertical
Articulation Demarcation)
      (2)   Shed, gabled, or hipped roof forms with dormers which have windows
or vents. (Figure 1161.2 – 3 Vertical Articulation – Roofing)
      (3)   Vertical recess of wall plane to a depth of at least three percent
(3%) of the building’s depth, with window openings in the recessed wall
indicating the presence of an upper-story. (Figure 1161.2 – 4 Vertical
Articulation – Recesses)
   (g)   Horizontal Articulation.  To break up wall planes on elevations
measuring more than sixty feet (60’) in width using bays proportionate to the
building dimensions and any two (2) of the following:
      (1)   Change in wall plane. Achieved using projections or recesses, the
change in depth from one bay to the next shall be a minimum of three percent
(3%) of the length of the façade.
      (2)   Change in height of wall and/or variation in roof form.
      (3)   Change in texture or masonry pattern.
      (4)   Windows.
      (5)   Other architectural elements and detailing such as pilasters.

potential conflicts between uses in one (1) zoning district from the uses in an
adjacent zoning district by using distance, plantings, fences, walls, and
mounds. The applicant should meet with the Planning Commission Staff to
determine the extent of the buffering required between two (2) zoning
districts. It is the intent of this Chapter to screen the less intensive
district from the effects of the more intensive district.

higher intensity uses than adjacent land shall meet the screening requirements
as a condition for approval.
      (2)   Expansion Re-Development – Higher Intensity. Where a property is
being expanded adjacent to another with a less intensive zoning district or
use, the redevelopment must meet the current screening standards for the entire
site. Any existing screening or vegetation will count towards the entire
screening.

1161.11 PARKING STANDARDS.
1161.11.1 PARKING STANDARDS, GENERAL – ALL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The intent of this Parking Standards Chapter is to establish minimal parking
standards to assure public health, safety and welfare; minimize risks to the
natural environment; create an aesthetic standard; minimize conflicts: and
promote vehicular and pedestrian safety along roadways by minimizing on-street
parking.
   (a)   Paving Required. Impervious Surface. All parking required in this
zoning ordinance shall utilize a paved surface of concrete, asphalt, brick
pavers, or the like. Under no circumstances shall gravel, stone, rock, dirt,
sand or grass be permitted as parking areas unless otherwise provided.
   (b)   Front Yard Residential Districts/USES. Driveways and the parking of
motor vehicles is not permitted on lawns, gravel, or other pervious type
surfaces.
   (c)   Off-Alley Access.  Drives and parking areas used to access accessory
buildings or detached garages are required to be paved if they are accessed
from an alley. This is applicable for all districts.
   (d)   Expansion of Legally Nonconforming Parking Areas.  The expansion of
any existing gravel, stone, or rock parking area is subject to Planning
Commission review and any subsequent conditions or requirements set by the
board.
   (e)   Ingress/Egress Paved.  All ingress and egress points onto a driveway
or into a parking area shall be paved.
   (f)   Parking Space Dimensions.
      (1)   Minimum Area:  Each parking space shall be a minimum of one hundred
sixty-two square feet (162 sq. ft.) in area.
      (2)   Minimum Width: Each parking space shall be a minimum of nine feet
(9’) wide.
      (3)   Minimum Length:  Standard: Each parking space shall be a minimum of
eighteen feet (18’) long.
   (g)   Parking Aisle Widths.  Minimum parking aisle widths shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Ninety-degree (90º) angle space:
         Twenty-four-foot (24’) wide parking aisle for one-or two way traffic.
      (2)   Sixty-degree (60º) angle space:
         Eighteen-foot (18’) wide parking aisle for one-way traffic.
      (3)   Forty-five-degree (45º) angle space:

         Twelve-foot (12’) wide parking aisle for one-way traffic.
         Twenty-four feet (24’) wide parking aisle for two-way traffic.
   (h)   Access. Off-street parking spaces must be accessed from a public or
private right-of-way or a platted access easement.
   (i)   Driving Lanes.  Driving lanes in parking lots that provide access to
parking aisles shall be clearly striped and shall be curbed.
   (j)   Parking Lot Layout. Where a Development Plan is required or when a re-
configuration of an existing parking lot is proposed, the Planning Commission
shall review the parking lot layout to ensure:
      (1)   Vehicular Circulation. That vehicular circulation to and within the
parking lot is managed in a manner that creates conditions favorable to health,
safety, convenience, and harmonious development by confirming;
      (2)   Access Points.  That the design and location of proposed street and
highway access points minimize safety hazards and congestion;
      (3)   Capacity. That the capacity of adjacent streets and highways is
sufficient to safely and efficiently accept traffic that will be generated by
the new development;
      (4)   Compatibility. That the entrances, streets, and internal traffic
circulation facilities in the Development Plan are compatible with existing and
planned streets and adjacent developments; and
      (5)   Compliance with design and performance requirements of Zoning Code
1153 and
1161.
Example: Existing lot with 90-degree parking proposes 45-degree parking,
narrowing the aisles to increase number of available parking spaces. The new
layout would be required to comply with landscaping, bump outs, etc., per the
new code requirements. Cross Reference City of Findlay Standards and
Specifications for the Construction of Curb Cuts and Drive Approaches.
   (k)   Parking Lot Striping. Parking spaces in parking lots shall be striped
so as to clearly show each parking space. The stripes shall be maintained in
clearly visible condition. Re-striping for maintenance purposes will not
require a zoning permit. However, the circulation and number of spaces provided
may not be changed without a site plan review and approval.
   (l)   Number of Parking Spaces Required.
      (1)   Per Zoning District Requirements. Unless a specific use is
identified in Section

space requirements by more than ten percent (10%) shall also:
         A.   Increase Bump-outs. The number of landscape bump-outs (in single-
aisle parking lots) or landscape bump-outs and islands (in multiple-aisle
parking lots) shall increase by the same percentage of the parking overage.
Descriptions for bump-outs and islands can be found in Section
1161.06 Landscaping Standards (B) Interior Parking Lots- Landscaping Islands.
[Example: If the number of parking spaces is increased by thirty percent (30%),
then the area of landscape islands and/or bump-outs shall be increased by
thirty percent (30%)]
         B.   Installation. Each additional landscape island and/or bump-out
shall be installed according to the requirements of Section
1161.06 Landscaping Standards Interior Parking Lots – Landscaping Islands &
Bump-outs.

Department for emergency access or parking shall not be counted toward the
minimum required parking spaces and shall be relocated or accommodated for
somewhere else on the site.
      (4)   Storage.  Any parking space that is used for a cart corral or
similar use shall not be counted toward the minimum number of required parking
spaces.
   (m)   Subordinate Accessory Use Area. Where a structure incorporates
subordinate accessory use areas that will not be used simultaneous to the
primary use areas, or where such accessory use areas serve those utilizing the
primary use areas of the structure, the Planning Commission may determine that
the parking requirement for the primary use areas of the structure is adequate.

   COMPLIANCE WITH CODE REGULATIONS
   (a)   All signs shall comply with the general rules, regulations, and
requirements governing their placement, type, number, and size as outlined and
contained in the provisions of this chapter.
      (1)   Obstruction of traffic signs; misleading or confusing signs. No
sign or sign structure shall be erected at any location where it may interfere
with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic sign,
signal or device. No rotating beam, beacon or flashing illumination resembling
any emergency lights shall be used in connection with any sign display, nor
shall any sign make use of the words “Stop,” “Look,” “Danger” or any other
word, phrase, symbol or character in such a manner as to interfere with,
mislead, or confuse traffic. No sign shall emit any form of sound or sounds.
      (2)   Obstruction of visibility. No sign or sign structure shall be
located or constructed within ten feet (10’) of any street right-of-way unless
provided for otherwise in another Chapter of this Ordinance. No sign shall be
located or constructed in such a manner as to materially impede the view of any
street or highway intersection, or in such a manner as to materially impede the
view of the intersection of a street or highway with a railroad crossing. No
sign shall be designed and placed so as to confuse traffic information for
pedestrians or drivers of motor vehicles. The determination of the
reasonableness of the location of a sign or sign structure taking into account
the above shall be made by the Zoning Administrator whose decision shall be
subject to appeal as provided herein to the Board of Zoning Appeals. See also
Section
1163.11 Corner Vision Clearance Standards.
         (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.12.5 ILLUMINATED SIGNS.
   (a)   Shielding. The light from an illuminated sign shall be so shaded,
shielded or directed that the light intensity or brightness will not be
reasonably objectionable as determined by the Zoning Administrator considering
those affected nearby.
   (b)   Exposure. No exposed bulbs or fluorescent tubes, with the exception of
neon lighting, shall be used on the exterior surface of any sign so as to
directly expose the face of the bulb, light or tube to any public street or
adjacent property.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.12.6 PERMITS, APPLICATIONS AND FEES.

constructing, altering or relocating a sign under the provisions of this
chapter, an application shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator which

         (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.12.9 SIGNS IN DOWNTOWN DISTRICT (C-3).
   The downtown is of unique character apart from the rest of the City. The
buildings are taller and closer to each other; building fronts are typically on
the front lot line, with business doors opening into the right of way;
vehicular traffic volumes are higher than in other areas of the City, and
drivers of all ability and ages are offered parking that is parallel between a
curb line and moving traffic; and the numerous signalized intersections,
parking options, pedestrians, and businesses create significantly more
vehicular obstacles and turning movements per lineal foot than anywhere else in
the community. As such, the placement of signage to support a thriving downtown
is just as important to the community’s safety as it is to identify business
locations. Downtown poses inherent constraints on signage design. The signs
are: closer to the street; offer shorter viewing distance/duration; more
difficult to notice due to the proximity to the street and short building
width, and the traffic speed relative to the more minimal street frontages mean
that business owners will seek more unique signage than the typical pylon/box
or monument style. The signage cannot impede the flow of pedestrian traffic,
nor can it be placed at the curb line and impede driver visibility and
maneuverability. Therefore, the following types of signage are permitted in C-
3 Downtown Business District.
   (a)   Wall Signs.
Wall Width (in feet) Maximum Sign Area
                     (square feet)
Under 15             25
15-19                30
20-24                35
25-29                35
30-34                35
35-39                40
40-44                40
45-49                40
50-54                50
55-59                50
60-64                60
65-69                60
70 and over          70 + 5 for each additional ten feet of frontage of
                     fraction thereof
   (b)   Projecting Signs.
      (1)   Six feet (6’) from curb face from the leading edge of the sign.
      (2)   Ten-foot (10’) clearance shall be provided between the baseline of
any sign and the sidewalk. No sign shall flash or blink. External illumination
is preferred.
   (c)   Low Profile.
      (1)   When buildings are set back on a lot in the downtown, a ground sign
may be appropriate (although not preferred) when all of the following
conditions are met:
         A.   Other alternative types of signs do not provide adequate
identification.
         B.   Scale and location of ground sign complements buildings in
adjacent properties.
         C.   Integration into site landscaping so as not to create a site or
visual obstruction.
   (d)   Sandwich Board Signs.  The following rules and regulations pertain to
sandwich boards and “A” Frames:
      (1)   Size.  The maximum allowable size of the sandwich board sign is
eight square feet. (8 sq ft.).
      (2)   Location. It may not impede in the required four-foot (4’) pathway
between the curb and the Allowable Business Area, if such exists. It is
preferred that the sandwich board either be placed in line with the permanent
street furniture (benches, light poles, trash receptacles) or adjacent to the
business entryway.
      (3)   Duration. Sandwich board signs must be taken inside at the close of
business.
      (4)   Number. One sandwich board is allowed per store front.
         (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.12.11 INTERSTATE HIGH-RISE SIGNS (C-1, C-2, I-1, I-2).
   One Interstate High-Rise Sign is permitted per site. The sign must be within
one thousand five hundred feet (1,500’) of Interstate 75 (I-75) rights-of-way.
Interstate High Rise Signs are limited to ninety-foot (90’) height and setbacks
that measure at least one-half (1/2) the height of the sign. The sign shall not
exceed 300’ three hundred square feet (300 sq. ft.) in area and not have more
than four (4) additional panels not exceeding seventy-five square feet (75 sq.
ft.) each. To advertise additional tenants within the center, see Section
1161.12.12 for Electronic Message Center requirements pertaining to Interstate
High-Rise Signs.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.12.12 ELECTRONIC MESSAGE BOARD C-1, C-2, I-1, I-2, I-3, UOD.
   The following requirements shall prevail over Electronic Message Centers, as
defined:
   (a)   Shall only be placed on conforming ground signs, or on Interstate
High-Rise Signs, where permitted and as defined.
   (b)   Shall not be permitted on any wall or fence.
   (c)   Interstate High Rise Signs are permitted to have an electronic message
board.
   (d)   Electronic Message Boards shall be at least three hundred feet (300’)
from any residential district.
   (e)   Electronic Message Boards shall only be permitted in the C1, C2, UOD,
I-1, I-2, and I-3 Districts and shall not be permitted in any other zoning
district, or overlay district.
   (f)   Electronic Message Boards shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%)
of the total approved constructed sign area.
   (g)   Electronic message boards shall remain constant for a period of not
less than eight (8) seconds per message.

petitioner submits verification that the communication equipment planned for
the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved tower, building, or other structure due
to two (2) or more of the following reasons:
   (a)   Structural Capacity. The planned communication equipment would exceed
the structural capacity of the existing or approved towers, buildings, or
structures as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer; and
the existing or approved towers, buildings or structures cannot be reinforced,
modified, or replaced to accommodate the planned communication equipment at a
reasonable cost.
   (b)   Communication Interference. The planned communication equipment would
cause interference impacting the usability of other existing communication
equipment at the site if placed on existing structures. Supporting
documentation, prepared by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, must
be provided that indicates that the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
   (c)   Design Requirements. The existing or approved towers, buildings, or
structures within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned
communication equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as
documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
   (d)   Reason(s) Unforeseen In This Ordinance.  Other unforeseen reasons that
make it unfeasible or impossible to locate the planned communication equipment
upon an existing or approved tower, building, or structure.

(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.15 CONDITIONAL USE REQUIREMENTS.
   The City Planning Commission shall have the duty to hear and decide
applications for conditional use permits. The City Planning Commission shall
determine that the general standards pertinent to each conditional use
identified in the Findlay Zoning Code shall be satisfied by the establishment
and operation of the proposed conditional use. The City Planning Commission may
also impose such additional conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary for
the general welfare, for the protection of individual property rights, and for
insuring that the intent and objectives of the Findlay Zoning Code will be
observed, including specified limitations as to future expansion.
   The City Planning Commission has no obligation to approve a Conditional Use.
This Zoning Code assumes that the uses listed as Conditional Uses are not
appropriate unless an applicant proves that the use will not be detrimental to
the public health, safety or general welfare of the City or the neighborhood in
which it is proposed. Applicants shall prove that potential negative impacts of
elements such as location, size and extent of facilities and operations, site
design, traffic generation, side access and potential impact upon public
facilities will be adequately addressed. (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1161.15.1 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   The Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances
of each proposed conditional use in terms of the following standards and shall
find adequate evidence showing that such use of the proposed location:
   1.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives
or with any specific objective of the Findlay Zoning code of current adoption;
   2.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
   3.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   4.   Will not be detrimental to property in the immediate vicinity or to the
community as a whole;
   5.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police, and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, and school; or that the persons or agencies responsible for
the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately any
such service.
   (a)   Approval, Expiration and Revocation.
      (1)   An approved conditional use will be for a period of one year
provided substantial progress and completion is made, unless an extension has
been granted by the Planning Commission. A maximum of two (2), six (6) month
extensions are allowed if the scope of the approval has not changed and the
proposed use and site plan still satisfy the decision standards. A Conditional
Use permit shall be valid and run with the land, provided substantial progress
and completion is made, only for the specific use and location approved and in
accordance with any conditions approved.
      (2)   Failure to complete or make substantial progress on the approved
use shall result in the expiration of its authorization and require a new
application.
      (3)   Zoning permits shall not be issued unless the plans substantially
conform to those approved by the City Planning Commission, including
conditions.
      (4)   A Conditional Use Permit shall automatically expire if the
Conditional Use ceases operation for more than one (1) year.
      (5)   A Conditional Use Permit may be revoked by the City Planning
Commission if the existing Conditional Use Permit fails to meet one of the
following requirements:
         A.   The conditions of approval are not met or maintained.
         B.   The continuance of the conditional use would pose a substantial
risk to the public health, safety and welfare. Notification will be provided to
all who are entitled to such notice.
      (6)   Modifications to a Conditional Use.
      (7)   Modifications shall be classified as a minor or major modification
based on the following:
      (8)   Minor Modification:
         A.   Does not change the use or density to a more intense use or
density than permitted by the approved plan; and
         B.   Does not change the location or amount of land designated for a
specific land use; and
         C.   Are of a magnitude that will not substantially alter the
appearance of the use from off of the site; and
         D.   Will not substantially or detrimentally affect the provision of
public services to the site or general vicinity; and
         E.   Will not substantially or detrimentally increase potential demand
on public or private utilities; and
         F.   Are not of a scope, scale, or character, that would cause a
negative impact on adjoining properties and neighborhood; and
         G.   Are not contrary to and in no way diminish the intent of the
originally approved permit.
      (9)   Major Modification.
         A.   An increase in density or intensity; or
         B.   Changes to the property or project boundaries; or
         C.   Anything not classified as a minor modification above.
         D.   A major modification requires an entirely new Conditional Use
application (including the fee), according to the provisions of this section.
      (10)   Review of Modifications. If an applicant proposes to modify an
approved Conditional Use, the applicant shall submit the proposed modifications
to the Zoning Inspector, supplemented with a written statement describing the
modifications. A Minor Modification may be reviewed administratively and
approved by both the Zoning Inspector. Administrative approvals shall be
clearly documented and made part of the original Conditional Use permit on file
and placed on the City Planning Commission’s agenda. Any changes to a
Conditional Use that are not approved by the Zoning Inspector or City Planning
Commission shall constitute a violation of the City Zoning Code.

1162.06   Nonconforming uses of structures.
1162.07   Uses under exception provisions, not nonconforming uses.
1162.08   Change in tenancy.
1162.09   Re-establishment of a nonconforming use.
1162.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit legal nonconforming lots,
structures, or uses to continue until they are removed.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.02 PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Nonconformities. It is recognized that there exist within the
districts established by this Ordinance and its amendments, lots, structures
and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this Ordinance was
passed or amended, which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under
the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments.
   (b)   Non-Precedent.  Such uses are declared by this Ordinance to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the
intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same District and shall be brought into
conformity with this Ordinance as soon as practicable.
   (c)   Containment.  A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use
of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended
or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment of a building or
premises or additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by
addition of other uses of a nature which would not be permitted generally in
the district involved.
   (d)   Projects at Time of Code Adoption. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in
this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction,
or designated use of any building for which a zoning permit was lawfully
acquired prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent position and fastening each in a permanent
manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal
shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work (demolition
and construction) shall be diligently carried on until completion of the
building involved.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   In any District, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of
this Ordinance, principal and accessory buildings may be erected on any lot of
record which exists at the effective date of this Ordinance’s adoption or
subsequent. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in this
District. However, the yard dimensions and other requirements not involving
area or width (or both) of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement variances may be
obtained through approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.04 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where a lawful use of land exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance that is made no longer permissible under the terms
of this Ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Proportion of Nonconformity. No such nonconforming use shall be
enlarged or increased after the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance except that the Planning Commission, after written notice to abutting
and adjacent property owners, may conditionally approve or deny an extension,
or enlargement of a nonconformity as a recommendation to City Council.
   (b)   Location of Nonconformity.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved
in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such
use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance except
that the Planning Commission, after written notice to abutting and adjacent
property owners, may conditionally approve or deny the relocation of a
nonconforming use as a recommendation to City Council.
   (c)   Extinction of Nonconformity. If such nonconforming use of land ceases
for any reason for a period of more than two (2) years, the nonconformity is
thereafter considered extinct and any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the District in which such
land is located. (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this
Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or
other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (a)   Proportion of Nonconformity. A nonconforming structure may be enlarged
or altered provided the new construction complies with the requirements of this
Ordinance.
Example: New work may not increase the nonconformity, such as encroachment into
the setbacks.
   (b)   Non-Replacement of Nonconformity. Should such structure be destroyed
by any means to an extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%) of its actual
cash value, exclusive of the foundation, it shall be reconstructed only in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. Cash value may be determined
by an appraisal or the Hancock County Auditor’s value.
   (c)   Location of Nonconformity. Should such structure be moved for any
reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the District in which it is located after it is moved. This
does not preclude the elevation of structures to comply with the flood damage
reduction ordinance. Portions of nonconforming buildings such as porches,
attached garages or other appurtenances may be replaced so long as the
replacement does not increase the degree of nonconformity of the structure.
   (d)   Additions to Nonconforming Structures.  Additions to nonconforming
structures must meet the applicable setbacks with the following exception:
Infill construction as noted below will be permitted.

Department of Interior Standards and Guidelines and receive a Certificate of
Appropriateness from the appropriate body in order to be eligible for this
exclusion.
      (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.06 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
   If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and land in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that
would not be permitted in the District under the terms of this Ordinance, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (a)   Proportion of Nonconformity. The City Planning Commission may
conditionally approve or deny the expansion, enlargement, or relocation of any
nonconforming use of any structure or land, or combination thereof as a
recommendation to City Council, after giving written notice to abutting and
adjacent property owners. One (1), two (2), or three (3) family uses, devoted
to a use not permitted by this Ordinance in the District in which it is
located, may be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or
structurally altered by approval of the Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   Confinement. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use,
and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but
no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building except
that the Planning Commission, after written notice to abutting and adjacent
property owners, may conditionally approve or deny such an extension as a
recommendation to City Council.
   (c)   Development Standards.  R-1, R-2, R-3, or R-4 district shall prevail
as applicable for any expansion or deconstruction of nonconforming single-
family dwelling.
   (d)   Equal or Lesser Nonconformity. Any nonconforming use of a structure
may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted
classification.
   (e)   Extinction of Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Replaced by Conforming Use. Once a nonconforming structure is used
for a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
District in which the structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed.
      (2)   Discontinued Use. When a nonconforming use of a structure is
discontinued or ceases to exist for any reason for two (2) years, the structure
shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the
District in which it is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses, such as
Christmas tree and produce stands, shall be exempt from this provision.
      (3)   Demolition/Destruction. Where nonconforming use status applies to a
structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land except when the use is re-
established within two (2) years of the removal and demolition and can be built
to applicable zoning standards.
         (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.07 USES UNDER EXCEPTION PROVISIONS, NOT NONCONFORMING USES
   Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this
Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such District.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.08 CHANGE IN TENANCY.
   There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing
nonconforming uses of land, of structures or of structures and land in
combination without the loss of nonconforming status.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1162.09 RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF A NONCONFORMING USE.
   There may exist a need to reestablish a nonconforming use for a particular
structure, lot, or both for some unforeseen reason. This may be done by
petition to Findlay City Council. The request shall be in the form of an
application and shall be reviewed by the City Planning Commission, City
Council’s Planning and Zoning Committee, and subsequently approved or denied by
action of Findlay City Council.

1164.01 PURPOSE.
   Based upon various studies done on the effects of adult entertainment
establishments on the
quality of community life, the recognition of The United States Supreme Court
and the courts of Ohio that a local government’s regulation of the location of
adult entertainment establishments in order to preserve the quality of urban
and rural life constitutes a substantial government interest, and based upon
the successful enactment and enforcement of similar ordinances throughout this
state and other states, the Findlay City Council hereby finds that the
enactment of a zoning provision to regulate the location of adult entertainment
establishments is a substantial government interest for the City of Findlay in
preserving the quality of urban and rural life and that it is in the interest
of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Findlay,
Ohio, that adult entertainment uses are regulated pursuant to the standards
herein.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1164.02 MITIGATING SECONDARY EFFECTS.
   This Chapter is intended to provide for the proper location of adult
entertainment uses in order to protect the integrity of adjacent neighborhoods,
educational uses, religious uses, parks and other commercial uses, and the
quality of urban and rural life. Proper separation of adult entertainment uses
prevents the creation of “skid-row” areas in the City of Findlay that results
from the concentration of these uses and their patrons. It is the intent of
this Chapter to limit the secondary effects of adult entertainment uses. The
standards in this Chapter are intended to ensure that residential and
agricultural districts, religious uses, educational uses, parks and other
commercial uses are located in areas free from the secondary effects of adult
entertainment uses. The location of residential and agricultural districts,
religious uses, educational uses, parks and other commercial uses within
viable, unblighted and desirable areas supports the preservation of property
values and promotes the health, safety and welfare of the public.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1164.03 PERMITTED DISTRICTS/CONDITIONAL USE.
   Adult Entertainment Establishments and Adult Entertainment Uses possess
unique characteristics requiring particular consideration as to their proper
location in relation to approximately established or intended uses, or to the
planned development of the community. Therefore, after verification by the
Zoning Inspector that they have met the requirements listed herein, they may be
permitted as conditional uses in I-1 Light Industrial Districts and I-2 General
Industrial Districts upon a majority vote of the City Council, after public
hearing, and after recommendations have been received from the City Plan
Commission pursuant to Section
 1113.16 and Section
1113.20 of the City of Findlay Zoning Ordinance and from the Hancock Regional
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1164.04 LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.
   Adult entertainment establishments, where otherwise permitted in a use
district, are subject to the following location restrictions:
1164.04.1 LOCATION REQUIREMENTS; RESIDENTIAL USES.
   No adult entertainment establishment shall be located within one thousand
feet (1000’) of a residential district (including R-1, R-2, R-3) or districts
and all areas which are designated “residential,” “residence,” “family,” or
“multiple-family” by any local comprehensive plan or zoning ordinance or
ordinance). However, an adult entertainment establishment may be permitted to
locate within one thousand feet (1000’) of a residentially zoned district or
use upon presentation to the Planning Commission of a validated petition
requesting such waiver, signed by in excess of fifty percent (50%) of those
persons owning residential land or business establishments within one thousand
feet (1000’) of the proposed location. The Planning Commission shall adopt
rules and regulations governing the procedure for securing the petition of
consent provided for in this Chapter as well as reasonable fees necessary for
administratively processing the petition. The rules shall provide that the
circulator of the petition requesting a waiver shall subscribe to an affidavit
attesting to the fact that the petition was circulated in accordance with the
rules of the Planning Commission, that the circulator personally witnessed the
signatures on the petition, and that the same were affixed to the petition by
the person whose name appeared thereon. The Planning Commission shall not
consider the waiver of location requirements set forth in this Chapter until
the above-described petition shall have been filed and verified.

Planning Commission makes the following findings:
   (a)   Public Interest/Injury.  That the proposed use / establishment will
not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby properties.
   (b)   Blighting. That the proposed use / establishment will not enlarge or
encourage the development of a blighting influence.
   (c)   Neighborhood Conservation. That the establishment of an additional
regulated use in the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood
conservation nor will it interfere with any program of urban renewal.
   (d)   Adherence to Ordinance. That all applicable regulations of this
Chapter will be observed. (Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)

uses, the distance shall be measured by drawing a straight line between the
nearest point on the perimeter of the exterior wall or bay of the proposed or
existing adult entertainment establishment and the nearest point on the
exterior wall or bay of another adult entertainment establishment. Measurement
shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or
objects. No adult entertainment use may be physically altered or expanded when
such alteration, addition, or subsequent structure would violate the location
restrictions of this ordinance as measured above.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)
1164.06 NO VARIANCE.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section

entertainment establishment under the terms of this Code, shall submit an
application to be declared a nonconforming use to the Planning Commission no
later than six (6) months from the adoption of this Ordinance. Failure to so
submit an application for nonconforming use shall result in the denial of
nonconforming status.
(Ord. 2023-115. Passed 12-19-23.)

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
         The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1351.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Authority to Implement Flood Damage Chapter. Article XVI11, §3, of the
Constitution of the State of Ohio grants a municipal corporation the legal
authority to adopt land use and control measures aimed at promoting the health,
safety, and the general welfare of its residents. Therefore, the City Council
of the City of Findlay, Hancock County, State of Ohio, does ordain the
following Flood Damage Reduction chapter.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Findlay has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation, which could result in the loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and government
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the City's tax base. In addition, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage
also contribute to flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damage,
and to achieve the purposes set for the flood damage reduction, this chapter is
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this flood damage reduction
chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human, animal, and aquatic life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water,
wastewater, and gas mains, electric, telephone, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard, so as to protect property and to
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions and decisions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on properties adjacent to,
within, and near flood-prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program [NFIP].
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this ordinance includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property, due to water hazards; or which result in damaging
increases in flood eights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the aeration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which could increase flood damage; and
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that
would unnaturally divert flood waters, or which could increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Findlay,
as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the City of Findlay after the effective date of
this section.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, the following studies and maps,
generated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Hancock County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective June 2, 2011.
         B.   Flood Insurance Rate Map Hancock County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas effective June 2, 2011.
         C.   Other studies and/or maps which could be relied on for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways, or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
         D.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses generated by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio, which analysis has been
approved by the City of Findlay, pursuant to Section
1351.04(a)(3), Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
            (Ord. 2011-031. Passed 5-3-11.)
      (2)    Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference to them, and declared to be part of this chapter. These
studies, maps, letters, and bulletins are on file at the City of Findlay
Municipal Building, Engineering Department, 318 Dorney Plaza, Findlay, Ohio
45840.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. The regulations contained in this
chapter are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances, including
Subdivision Regulations, or Zoning Codes. In the event of conflict between the
provisions of this chapter and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall
be followed. The provisions of this chapter shall not impair any deed
restrictions, covenant, or easement, but the land subject to such interests
shall also be governed by this chapter.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered to be minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the City Council of the City of
Findlay;
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor to repeal any other powers granted
under Ohio statute.
   Where a provision of this chapter might be in conflict with an Ohio statute,
federal statute, or other Ohio or federal regulation, such Ohio or federal
statute or regulation shall take precedence over this chapter.
(Ord. 2006-067. Passed 9-5-06.)
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes, and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights might be increased by manmade or
natural causes. The provisions of this chapter do not imply that land outside
the areas of special flood hazard, or uses permitted within such areas, will be
free from flooding or flood damage. The provisions of this chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the City of Findlay, any officer or employee of
it; Mutual Aid Floodplain Administrator or their Agency; or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
under this chapter.
(Ord. 2009-106. Passed 12-1-09.)
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be
declared by courts of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid,
such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any
part of it, other than the section or provision declared to be unconstitutional
or otherwise invalid.
(Ord. 2006-067. Passed 9-5-06.)
1351.02 DEFINITIONS.

flood elevations, and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
         C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision [CLOMR]. A formal review and
comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project and whether it complies with the
minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A
CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood

purposes of this chapter, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes, as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (36)    Manufactured home park. As described at §3701-27-01 of the Ohio
Administrative Code, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon
which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation, are parked, either
free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked on the parcel of
real estate, if the roadways are dedicated to the City.

program enabling owners of real property in participating communities to
purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is
designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that the federal government make flood
insurance available within the community as financial protection against flood
loss. In return the City agrees to adopt and to enforce floodplain management
regulations to reduce future flood risk to all development in special flood
hazard areas.

is primarily to meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements.
These requirements include review and approval by FEMA for purposes of
verifying that the City of Findlay's flood maps, studies, and other data
accurately represent flooding conditions. This purpose is important because
appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data. The
following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement of new technical data submission:
         A.   For all development proposals that have an impact on floodway
delineations or base flood elevations, the City of Findlay shall ensure that
technical data reflecting such changes are submitted to FEMA within six months

elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            4.    Subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations pursuant to Section
1351.04(a)(3). For purposes of this Section, the term, "large-scale
development", means any development containing at least 50 lots or 5 acres,
whichever is less.
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to prepare or cause to
be prepared technical data specified in this Section, and prepared in a format
required for Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and

provide a Conditional Letter of Map Revision before the floodplain development
permit is issued in either or both of the following circumstances:
            1.    Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevations.
            2.    Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has indicated base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits that the Floodplain Administrator
issues shall be conditioned upon the applicant's having obtained a Letter of
Map Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to the requirements
of subsection (k)(1)A. hereof.
      (2)    Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
could require that the applicant provide changes to any of the data shown on an
effective map [that is, an official floodplain map] that does not affect
floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling
or planimetric details. If such requirement is imposed, the applicant shall
submit supporting data made in writing to the Mayor of the City of Findlay; and
such data may be submitted at any time.
      (3)    Annexation and/or detachment. The Floodplain Administrator shall
notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Findlay are
modified by annexation; or when the City of Findlay has assumed authority over
an area; or when the City no longer has authority to adopt and to enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Findlay's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City's
boundaries, the City shall include with such notification to FEMA a copy of the
map, suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the
new area for which the City of Findlay has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority. The City shall include a copy of the enabling
ordinance that approved the annexation or detachment. Before a parcel of real
property is annexed to the City of Findlay, any pre-existing floodplain
violation that would constitute a violation of the City of Findlay Flood Damage
Prevention chapter shall be resolved to comply with the chapter.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)    In areas that FEMA has not designated special flood hazard areas;
or in areas where FEMA has designated special flood hazards, and where base
flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review and reasonably rely on other flood hazard data
available from a federal, state, or other reliable source, constituting the
best available information.
      (2)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflects a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of reliable data, showing
increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on
FEMA flood maps and studies, shall be reasonably relied upon by the Floodplain
Administrator as best available information.
      (3)    When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Before FEMA issues a Letter of Final Determination, the use of
preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base flood
elevations and/or floodway areas exist, or where the preliminary base flood
elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or floodway
widths in existing flood hazard data that FEMA has provided. Such preliminary
data could be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
         B.   When FEMA issues a Letter of Final Determination, the preliminary
flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing flood
hazard data provided from FEMA, for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
      (4)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation,
pursuant to Section
1351.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)    Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations are contradictory, the base flood elevations or flood
protection elevations, as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
established high water marks, and the like, shall prevail.
   (m)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)    Damage to structures could result from a variety of causes,
including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, and the like. When such an
event results in structure damage, all of the following activities apply:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas.
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas.
         C.   Make reasonable attempts to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit before
any repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction takes place.
         D.   Reliable data collected from insurance adjusters and other
persons with expertise to render such determinations may be used to make
official substantial damage determinations.
      (2)    The Floodplain Administrator could also implement other measures
to assist in substantial damage determination and subsequent repairs. These
measures could include issuing information to the news media, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to floodplain
development permits and repairs to damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local units of government and governmental agencies;
providing owners of damaged structures with information related to repair of
such structures in special flood hazard areas; and assisting owners of
substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance
claims.
         (Ord. 2006-067. Passed 9-5-06.)

            8.    When the City has granted final grade approval, and/or if
FEMA has granted final grade approval, no development, including the placing of
fill dirt, shall take place until a development permit has been approved
pursuant to subsection (a)(3) hereof.
      (4)    Residential structures.
         A.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic or hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Where a structure and its foundation members are elevated on fill to or above
the base flood elevation, the requirements for anchoring and construction
materials resistant to flood damage are satisfied.
         B.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with methods and materials resistant to flood damage.
         C.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation [including ductwork],
plumbing, and air conditioning equipment or other service components and floor
joists that are designed and/or elevated so as to prevent water from entering
or accumulating within the components during flooding conditions.
         D.   The City shall prohibit the construction of any basement in a
special flood hazard area or 100-year floodplain. New construction and
substantial improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured
homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
the base flood elevation. In Zone AO areas with no elevations specified, the
structure shall have the lowest floor, elevated at least two feet above the
highest adjacent natural grade.
         E.   New construction and substantial improvements, including
manufactured homes, that do not have basements and that are elevated to the
flood protection elevation using pilings, posts, columns, or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to allow unimpeded movement of flood
waters, may have an enclosure below the lowest floor, provided that the
enclosure meets the following standards:
            1.   Used only for vehicle parking, building access, or storage;
and
            2.    Designed and certified by a registered Professional Engineer
or Architect licensed to practice in the State of Ohio. Such design must show
that the new construction or substantial improvement automatically equalizes
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters; or
            3.   Has a minimum of two openings on different walls, having a
total net area not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area, and the bottom of all such openings being no higher than one foot above
exterior grade; and the vent must be completely below base flood elevation
(BFE). The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings
or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
         F.   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
         G.   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of this Section.
      (5)    Nonresidential structures.
         A.   New construction, and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall meet the requirements of
subsection (a)(4)A.-C. and E.-G. hereof.
         B.   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall have either the lowest
floor, including floor joists and basement, elevated to or above the level of
the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall meet all of the following standards:
            1.    Be dry floodproofed so that the structure is watertight, with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, to the level of flood
protection elevation.
            2.    Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
            3.    Be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect, through the use of a Federal Emergency Management Agency
Floodproofing Certificate, that the design and methods of construction comport
with subsection (a)(5)B.1. and 2. hereof.
      (6)    All crawlspace construction. Subject to the provisions of FEMA
Technical bulletin 11-01, crawlspace construction for buildings located in
special flood hazard areas, the following requirements apply:
         A.    The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed through
the required openings described at subsection (a)(6)B. hereof. Because of
hydrodynamic loads, crawl space construction is not recommended in areas with
flood velocities greater than 5 feet per second, unless the design is reviewed
by an Architect or Professional Engineer registered in the State of Ohio. Other
types of foundations are recommended for these areas.
         B.   As an enclosed area below, BFE, the crawl space must have
openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures, allowing the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening shall be no more
than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade, pursuant to FEMA
Technical Bulletin 1-93, Openings in Foundation Walls.
         C.   Crawl space construction is not permitted in V Zones, for which
are required open pile or column foundations that withstand storm surge and
wave forces.
         D.   Portions of a building below BFE must be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. This requirement includes: foundation
walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building; joists; and insulation.
The recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of the joists
and all insulation above BFE. Insulation is not flood resistant. When
insulation becomes saturated with floodwater, the additional weight often pulls
the insulation from the joists and flooring. Ductwork and other utility systems
placed below insulation could also pull away from their supports. Please see
FEMA Technical Bulletin 2-93, Flood Resistant Materials Requirements.
         E.   Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be
elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate
within the system components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in particular,
must either be placed above BFE or sealed from floodwaters. Please see FEMA
Technical Bulletin 348, Protecting Building Utilities From Flood Damage.
      (7)    Additional requirements for below-grade crawlspaces. Subject to
FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01, the following requirements for construction of
below-grade crawlspaces apply:
         A.   The interior grade of a crawlspace below BFE must not be more
than 2 feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG). Please see the
drawing immediately below.
 
[Image]
Figure 2: Below-grade crawlspace construction.
         B.   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the
interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall
must not exceed 4 feet at any point (shown as L in the drawing below). The
height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to
the engineering analyses for flood hazard areas. This limitation also prevents
crawlspaces from being converted to habitable spaces.
 
[Image]
Figure 3: Requirements regarding below-grade crawlspace construction.
         C.   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes
floodwaters from the interior of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be
drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage
system will vary because of site gradient and other drainage characteristics,
such as soil type. Options to be used in order to comport with this requirement
include drainage through porous, well-drained soils, and drainage systems such
as perforated pipe, drainage tile, or gravel or crushed stone drainage by
gravity or mechanical means.
         D.   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed 5 feet
per second for any crawlspace. For velocities exceeding 5 feet per second,
other foundation types must be used.
         E.   Below grade crawlspace construction pursuant to these
requirements of this section shall not be considered to be basements.
      (8)    Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or Dry Floodproofing
Standards may be granted for accessory structures containing not more than 600
square feet; except that, such structures must be firmly anchored to prevent
flotation. Accessory structures greater than 600 square feet must meet all of
the following standards:
         A.   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials.
         B.   They shall not be used or intended for human habitation.
         C.   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         D.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
         E.   Service facilities, such as electrical and heating equipment,
shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation.
         F.   They shall meet the opening requirements of subsection (a)(4)E.3.
      (9)    Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles must meet at least
one of the following standards:
         A.   They shall not be placed on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days; or
         B.   They must be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         C.   They must meet all standards of subsection (a)(4) hereof.
      (10)    Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
      (11)    Ensuring flood-carrying capacity. Pursuant to the purposes and
methods of reducing flood damage, stated in this chapter, the following
additional standards are hereby adopted to ensure that the reduction of the
flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
         A.   Development in floodways.
            1.    In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Before the
Floodplain Administrator issues a floodplain development permit, the applicant
must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a Registered
Professional Engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development would not
result in any increase in the base flood elevation; or
               a.   Permits for development in floodway areas causing increases
in the base flood elevation may be granted, provided that the applicant comply
with all of the following:
                   i.    Meet the requirements to submit technical data in
Section
1351.03(k)(1).
                  ii.   Provide proof of an evaluation of alternatives that
would not result in increased base flood elevations and reasonable grounds for
believing that such alternatives are not feasible.
                  iii.    Provide certification that no structures are located
in areas that would be affected adversely by the increased base flood
elevation.
                  iv.    Provide documentation that individual property owners,
inside and outside the community, who are affected adversely by the proposed
result to their property, had been notified of the impact of the proposed
development.
                  v.    Obtain the concurrence of the Mayor of the City of
Findlay, and the Chief Executive officers of any communities that could be
affected by the proposed development.
         B.   Alteration of a watercourse. For the purpose of this chapter, a
watercourse located in a 100-year floodplain is altered when any change occurs
within its banks. The boundaries or extent of the banks shall be established by
a field determination of the "bank full stage". The field determination of bank
full stage shall be based on methods presented in the United States Department
of Agriculture Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream Channel
Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique, current edition; or
based on other applicable publication generally considered to be authoritative,
issued by a federal, Ohio, or other recognized source. For all proposed
developments that alter a watercourse, the following apply:
            1.    The bank full flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Before the
Floodplain Administrator issues a floodplain development permit, the applicant
must submit a description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as the result of the proposed development; and the
applicant must provide certification by a Registered Professional Engineer
licensed to practice in the State of Ohio that the bank full flood carrying
capacity of the watercourse will not be diminished.
            2.    Communities adjacent to the City of Findlay, the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources [ODNR],
Division of Water, must be notified by the applicant/developer prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence that such advance notice
has been made must be provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The
applicant must provide the necessary maintenance for the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse, so that the flood carrying capacity is not
diminished. The Floodplain Administrator could require the applicant/permit
holder to enter an agreement with the City of Findlay, specifying any such
maintenance responsibilities, including their duration. If the Floodplain
Administrator does require such maintenance agreement, it shall be made a
condition of the floodplain development permit.
            3.    The applicant shall meet the requirements of Section
1351.03(k)(1)A. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
         C.   Compensatory storage required for fill.
Fill within the area of special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of
natural floodplain storage. The volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to
filling in the special flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal
volume of flood storage by excavation or other compensatory measures within the
development site.
         D.   Storage of material or equipment.
Storage of material or equipment not otherwise prohibited in subsection (a)
(1)B. hereof, shall be firmly anchored and/or securely contained to prevent
flotation.
         E.   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
            1.    In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA
where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
base flood elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance
of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
            2.    Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified
by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
               i.    An evaluation of alternatives which would result in a
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
               ii.    Section
 1351.04(a)(11)A.1.a., items (i) and (iii)- v).
(Ord. 2006-067. Passed 9-5-06.)
1351.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.

and faculties, such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and
bridges.
                b.    A variance shall only be issued upon:
                  i.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
                  ii.    A determination that not granting the variance would
result in undue hardship because of the physical characteristics of the real
property that is the subject of the variance request.
                  iii.    A determination that granting the variance would not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which are allowed in this
ordinance; or that the variance would not pose additional threat to public
safety; or that granting the variance would not cause extraordinary public
expense; or that the variance would not create a nuisance, fraud, or
victimization of the public; or that that variance is not in conflict with
existing City ordinances.
                  iv.    A determination that the structure or other
development is protected by measures that minimize flood damage.
                  v.    A determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
                  vi.    Any other factors that the City Planning Commission
deems appropriate.
               c.    After considering the factors described in subsection (d)
(1) hereof, the City Planning Commission could attach any such conditions to
the grant of a variance that the Commission deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
         D.   Other conditions for variances.
            1.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
            2.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements on a lot of ½ acre or less in size, contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, provided that the items listed at subsection (d)(1)C.1.a.i.-xi. have
been fully considered. As a lot size increases beyond ½ acre, the technical
justifications required for granting a variance increase.
            3.    Any applicant granted a variance shall be given notice of the
variance in writing. The notice shall inform the applicant that the structure
that is the subject of the variance may be built with a lowest floor elevation
below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (e)   Hearing Procedure.
      (1)    In general, the hearing shall be conducted in the manner in which
the City Planning Commission meetings are typically conducted.
      (2)    All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (3)    Minutes of the proceedings shall be kept; except that, the
deliberations of the Planning Commission shall be confidential to the limits
permitted pursuant to Section 149.44 of the Ohio Revised Code. The record of
the proceedings shall include all documentary evidence presented at the hearing
and as part of the request for the variance. Testimonial evidence shall be
taken; except that, the Appellant/Applicant may choose to request a Court
Reporter or other verbatim recording of the hearing at the expense of the
Appellant/Applicant.
      (4)    The Floodplain Administrator may present evidence or testimony
concerning the appeal for a variance.
      (5)    Witnesses who present testimony shall be subject to cross-
examination by the adverse party or his/her counsel and/or members of the
Planning Commission.
      (6)    Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered, and shall be
included with the record of the hearing.

request by the Appellant for particular witnesses. A reasonable deposit for
issuing the subpoena shall be made at the time the subpoena request is made.
The Planning Commission shall, in its discretion, establish a reasonable fee
for service of subpoena and mileage. All such subpoenas are to be served by the
Findlay Police Department.
      (8)    The City Planning Commission shall prepare conclusions of fact
supporting its decision. The decision could be announced either at the
conclusion of the hearing and thereafter given in writing; or the Commission
could choose to issue its decision within a reasonable time, not later than the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission, unless it
determines that a longer period is necessary, in the interest of justice, to
obtain relevant engineering or other data on which the Commission must base its
decision.
   (f)   Appeal to Common Pleas Court. An applicant aggrieved by the City
Planning Commission's decision may appeal that decision to the Hancock County
Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to Chapters 2505 and 2506 of the Ohio Revised

(Ord. 1993-2. Passed 2-2-93.)
1373.04 DESIGN REVIEW BOARD; POWERS AND DUTIES.
   Within the boundaries of any Preservation District established by Council,
the Design Review Board shall review any proposed alterations or changes to
property as herein defined. The Board's approval of such alteration or change
shall be secured before any owner of property may commence work thereon. In
reviewing proposed alterations or changes to property, the Board shall use as
evaluative criteria the ten federal standards established by the Secretary of
the U.S. Department of the Interior as follows:
   (a)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site
and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
   (b)    The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
   (c)    All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)    Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (e)    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)    Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different elements from other
buildings or structures.
   (g)    The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
    (i)    Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
    (j)    Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
       (Ord. 1993-2. Passed 2-2-93.)
1373.05 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES AND PERMITS.
   No construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any structure
or significant exterior architectural feature thereof in any designated
Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to obtaining a certificate of
appropriateness from the Design Review Board and a certificate of occupancy
from the Zoning Department. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the
Zoning Department for the construction, reconstruction, alteration or
demolition of any area, place, site, building, structure, object or work of art
within a designated Preservation District unless the application for such
permit is approved by the Design Review Board through the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness in the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 1993-2. Passed 2-2-93.)
1373.06 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)    When the owner of a property within a Preservation District intends
to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish any portion of a structure within
the District, he shall first apply for and secure a certificate of
appropriateness from the Design Review Board. The application for a certificate
shall be deposited with the City's Zoning Officer, together with such plans,
specifications and other material as the DRB may from time to time prescribe.
The Zoning Officer shall immediately transmit such application to the secretary
of the Design Review Board.
   (b)    Within thirty days of filing, the Board shall consider the
applications, plans and specifications, and determine:
      (1)    Whether any exterior architectural feature is involved and
      (2)    Whether a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued or
denied.
   If the DRB determines that no architectural feature is involved, it shall
cause the secretary to endorse the certificate of appropriateness and return
the application, plans and specifications to the applicant. If the Board fails
to act on an application within thirty days of filing, the application shall be
deemed approved.
   (c)    In the event that the Design Review Board finds that an architectural
feature is involved, the Board shall determine whether the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition is appropriate or
whether it has an adverse effect upon the purposes of this chapter or the
Preservation District. In making such determination, the Board shall refer to
the Secretary of the Interior’s "Standards for Rehabilitation" as quoted
herein. In the case of archeological properties, the Board shall refer to the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's "Treatment of Archaeological
Properties: A Handbook".
   (d)    The Board may require any person applying for a certificate of
appropriateness or request any person whose interests appear adverse to those
of the applicant, to file with the Board prior to any hearing or determination,
information concerning the applicant's intentions, or such adverse person's
interests or intentions.
   (e)    If the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or
demolition is determined to have no adverse effect on the Preservation
District, and does not violate the spirit and purpose of these regulations,
then the Board secretary shall issue the certificate of appropriateness.
   (f)    If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition will have an adverse effect on the
Preservation District, and does violate the spirit and purposes of these
regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of the certificate of
appropriateness.
   (g)    In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the
thirty-day review period that a certificate of appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object or work of art. The secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Zoning Department of such determination
and transmit to him a certified copy of the reasons for denial and
recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (h)    Upon denying a certificate of appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty days, but not to exceed six months from the
date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with the owner
of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to both.
The first meeting between the Board and the applicant shall be held within
thirty days from the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal is accepted
by both parties, the Board may henceforth issue a certificate of
appropriateness.
    (i)    In the case of a denial of a certificate of appropriateness for
demolition:
       (1)    The Board and the applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of
preserving the property. The Board and the applicant shall investigate the
feasibility of all means of preserving the listed property. If the Board and
the applicant do not agree on a means of preserving the structure at the
initial meeting, then they must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing
discussions for the purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and
such good faith meetings shall be held at least every forty-five days after the
initial meeting.
       (2)    If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at
the time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
       (3)    If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the secretary of the Board shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness for such proposed demolition.
       (4)    If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative property use is developed or no offer to
save the structure is made by the applicant, the Board or a third party, then
the applicant may appeal the decision to Council. Council may affirm or reverse
the Board decision. If Council affirms the decision, the denial of the
certificate of appropriateness will stand.
 
   (j)    In the case of a denial of a certificate of appropriateness for
construction, reconstruction or alteration:
       (1)    The Board and the applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find an alternative
to incompatible new construction, reconstruction or alteration within a
Preservation District. If the Board and applicant do not agree on an
alternative solution at the initial meeting, then they must continue to
undertake meaningful discussions for the purpose of seeking a compromise
solution, and such good faith meetings shall be held at least every forty-five
days after the initial meeting.
       (2)    If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith in
the time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
       (3)    If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the secretary of the Board shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness, for such proposed construction, reconstruction
or alteration.
       (4)    If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction or alteration is reached, then the applicant may appeal the
decision to Council. Council may affirm or reverse the Board decision. If
Council affirms the decision, the denial of the certificate of appropriateness
will stand.
