ADOPTING ORDINANCE
Ordinance No. 98-109            Passed December 17, 1998

   WHEREAS, the Council has had the matter of codification and general revision
of the legislation of the City before it for some time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of the City's legislation, together with the new
matter to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is
before the Council; and
   WHEREAS, in order to meet publishing deadlines, this matter shall be adopted
as an emergency;
   NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PICKERINGTON,
FAIRFIELD-FRANKLIN COUNTIES, OHIO, THREE-FOURTHS OF ITS MEMBERS CONCURRING:

   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Municipal Clerk, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof and filed with the permanent records of the City of Pickerington, Ohio.
   SECTION 2: That all ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof that are in
conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the 1998 Codified Ordinances are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the 1998 Codified Ordinances shall not be construed
to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, nor an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

EDITOR'S NOTE
 
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

INCORPORATION, POWERS, FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 1.01. INCORPORATION.

of the State of Ohio. All such powers shall be exercised in the manner
prescribed in this Charter, or, to the extent that the manner is not prescribed
herein, in such manner as shall be provided by Council. The laws of the State
of Ohio not inconsistent with this Charter shall have the force and effect of
the City's ordinances.
SECTION 1.03. FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
   The form of government provided in this Charter shall be known as the

All meetings of Council shall be open to the public, except as allowed by the
laws of the State of Ohio.
SECTION 2.04. POWERS.
   The legislative powers of the City under this Charter, together with all
such powers as conferred by the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio upon
municipalities, shall be vested in Council.

meeting, which shall be in written form and which shall contain a concise
title. The form and style of ordinance or resolution shall be determined by
Council.
SECTION 2.05. FORM OF ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   Council action shall be by motion, ordinance or resolution. No Council
action shall be invalidated merely because the form of the action taken fails
to comply with the provisions of this Charter.
   (A)   MOTIONS. Council shall use a motion to determine policy and procedural
matters; to conduct elections among and make appointments by Council members;
and as otherwise provided in this Charter or by Council.
   (B)   RESOLUTIONS. Council shall use a resolution, where practicable, for
any legislation of a temporary, informal or ceremonial nature and as otherwise
provided in this Charter or by Council. Each resolution shall be read at two
meetings, unless this requirement is dispensed with by an affirmative vote of
at least three-fourth's (3/4's) of Council members voting, but not less than
the affirmative vote of four (4) Council members. The first reading shall be by
title only. The second reading shall be by title only, unless a full reading is
required by Council. Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, a resolution
shall become effective immediately after its approval by the Mayor; or upon the
expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by the Mayor; or upon its
passage after veto by the Mayor, as the case may be.
   (C)   ORDINANCES. Council shall use an ordinance, where practicable, for any
legislation of a general or permanent nature and as otherwise provided in this

affirmative vote of four (4) Council members. The first and second reading
shall be by title only. The third reading shall be by title only, unless a full

and resolutions which include, but are not limited to, appointments to boards
or commissions, acceptance or grants of easements, resolutions of support or
opposition, or acceptance of land, to be read only one time and voted on one
time for passage. Any Council member, the Mayor, or any interested party may
request an ordinance or resolution be removed from the consent agenda at any
time prior to a vote. Such ordinance or resolution shall then be moved to the
regular agenda. No appropriation or measure to expend funds in an amount above
an amount established by Council by ordinance shall be placed on the consent
agenda. Consent agenda items shall be effective immediately.
   (E)   VOTE. The vote on the question of passage of each motion, resolution,
or ordinance shall be taken by “yes” or “no” and the vote entered in the
minutes. No measure shall be passed without at least an affirmative vote of
four (4) Council members.
   Each ordinance or resolution shall be authenticated by the Clerk. The
failure to sign shall not invalidate an otherwise properly enacted ordinance or
resolution.
   (F)   EMERGENCY ORDINANCE. Any emergency ordinance or resolution shall
require an affirmative vote of at least six (6) Council members for enactment.
If any emergency ordinance or resolution shall fail to receive the required six
(6) affirmative votes, but receives the necessary majority for passage as non-
emergency legislation, it shall become effective as non-emergency legislation.
   Council before enacting shall determine that the ordinance or resolution is
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety,
or welfare of the citizens of Pickerington, Ohio, and the ordinance or
resolution shall state:

of the citizens of Pickerington requiring the passage of an emergency ordinance
or resolution;
      (2)   The factual basis utilized in determining the existence of the
threat to the public peace, safety, health or welfare emergency;

preservation of the public peace, health, safety or welfare of the citizens of
Pickerington; and

public peace, health, safety or welfare of the citizens of Pickerington.

   (I)   ADOPTION OF TECHINCAL CODES. Notwithstanding other sections of this
Charter, Council may adopt by ordinance or resolution all or part of any
technical codes promulgated by State or Federal agencies, boards, or any other
public or private agency. These codes may be adopted by reference but shall
include the date, title, and source of the code adopted by reference.
   (J)   APPROPRIATION LEGISLATION. Each ordinance or resolution providing for
the appropriation of money, or for the annual tax levy, or for improvements
petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the adjacent property to be
benefited and specially assessed, or for the preservation of the public peace,
health, welfare, or safety, shall take effect, unless a later date is specified

the Mayor, as the case may be.
SECTION 2.06. OFFICERS.
   At the first meeting in January of each year, Council shall immediately
proceed to elect a President and a Vice President from its own number, who
shall serve until the first meeting in January of the next calendar year.
   When the Mayor gives notice to the City Clerk of his or her unavailability
or is unable, for any cause, to perform the duties of Mayor, the President
shall be the Acting Mayor, and shall have the power and perform the same duties
as the Mayor. When both the Mayor and the President are absent from the City or

   No ordinance or resolution, or section or subsection thereof, shall be
revised or amended unless the ordinance or resolution superseding it contains a
restatement of the entire ordinance or resolution, or a restatement of the
section or subsection thereof to be revised or amended. Upon being revised or
amended, the portions of the original legislation which are in conflict with
the revised or amended legislation shall be superseded and repealed.
ARTICLE III

shall be determined by Council.
   (C)   Veto. Every Council ordinance or resolution shall be presented to the
Mayor for consideration. Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, the
Mayor may approve or veto the whole of any ordinance or resolution. Unless an
ordinance or resolution is returned to the City Clerk, either signed or with
written notice of veto within three (3) days, after submission to the Mayor, it
shall take effect as though the Mayor had signed it and approved the same. The
City Clerk upon receiving notice of a veto of any ordinance or resolution shall
within twenty-four (24) hours after receiving notice of the veto notify each
Council member in writing of the veto. Failure to serve notice to any Council
member shall not affect the validity of the veto or Council's right to override
the same. When the Mayor has vetoed an ordinance or resolution, Council may at
the next regular or special meeting reconsider it, and if such legislation
shall then be approved by the affirmative vote of at least five (5) Council
members it shall become effective notwithstanding the Mayor's veto.
   (D)   Judicial. The Mayor shall have all the judicial powers granted

      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.

202.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   A provision of these Codified Ordinances which is re-enacted or

Codified Ordinances and not a new enactment, so far as it is the same as the
prior provision.
(ORC 1.54)
   (b)   The repeal of a repealing provision of these Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of these Codified
Ordinances does not, except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred with respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
provision had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of a provision of these Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed
according to the provision as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
202.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections, or of subsections or other subdivisions of a section, such
reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any section, subsection or
other such subdivision included in such reference.
   (b)   References in these Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of these Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

(ORC 1.23)
   (c)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,

(ORC 1.56)
202.06 CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the City, and
all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the adoption of these
Codified Ordinances and inconsistent or in conflict with any of the provisions
of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed, save and except any
ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same, expressly
excepted from repeal by the ordinance that adopts these Codified Ordinances. No
ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same, of the City,
that is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances and/or that can be reasonably interpreted to be compatible
with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, shall be deemed to be
repealed by the adoption of these Codified Ordinances. Such ordinances,
resolutions, rules and regulations, and all parts of the same, shall continue
to be viable and enforceable by the City.
   (b)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the City pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 731.231 or a Municipal Charter, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control. In the event of a conflict between
any of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any provision of State
law, including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to State law, the
State law, rule or regulation shall control if it is of a kind required to be
in conformity with State law by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution; otherwise, the provision of these Codified Ordinances shall
control.
(Ord. 2011-09. Passed 3-15-11.)
   (c)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (d)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevails.
(ORC 1.51) (Ord. 2008-87. Passed 1-6-09.)
   (e)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (f)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting a provision of these Codified Ordinances, it is presumed
that:
      (1)   Compliance with the Constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire provision is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   A provision of these Codified Ordinances is presumed to be prospective
in its operation unless it is expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If a provision of these Codified Ordinances is ambiguous, the court,
in determining the intention of Council, may consider, among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which provision was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction; and
      (6)   The administrative construction of the provision.
(ORC 1.49) (Ord. 2007-44. Passed 11-20-08)
202.08 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in these Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the City, any
act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance of such act,
or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall, unless
another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the offender
shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise provided.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

reflect changes in risks to customers and to the safety and soundness of the
creditor from identity theft. The Program incorporates any existing policies
and procedures that control reasonably foreseeable risks as already implemented
by the City.
(Ord. 2009-20. Passed 5-19-09.)

authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection
with covered accounts;

agency that someone has fraudulently claimed to represent the customer.

members and other persons who wish to address Council, prior to such member or
person taking the floor. All persons not personally known by Council shall
furnish their names, addresses, and the reason for their appearance upon
request of the Presiding Officer prior to being recognized. The Presiding
Officer may utilize the following rules when exercising his or her control of
meetings:
      (1)   No member or person shall be permitted to speak a second time until
all members or persons have had an opportunity to speak;
      (2)   The Presiding Officer, unless overruled by a majority vote of
Council, may refuse the floor to any member or person where the tactics are
obviously to intentionally delay and not in the best interest of Council;
      (3)   The above rules may be suspended to permit unlimited debate by a
vote of a three-fourths majority of Council.
(Ord. 2007-44. Passed 11-20-08; Ord. 2008-87. Passed 1-6-09.)
220.11 VOTING.
   (a)   Voting. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or by law, all
ordinances and resolutions will be voted upon in open Council, and shall be
oral roll call votes. The roll call voting shall be different from successive
meetings as called by the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall call the roll and
each Council member will respond either “yes”, “no”, or “abstain”. No other
comment shall be considered proper during the vote. The City Clerk shall record
the vote and the same shall be preserved in the minutes of the meeting. After
the vote is complete, the City Clerk shall disclose the results thereof. Except
as otherwise provided herein or by the Charter, a majority shall carry any
resolution, ordinance or motion. The Mayor shall have no vote. No question
concerning the vote of any member will be proper after the vote is called.
(Ord. 80-77. Passed 12-16-80.)
   (b)   Abstaining Vote. No member shall be questioned concerning the
necessity of an abstaining vote. A decision to abstain is a matter personal to
each member and under no condition may this action be challenged. Each member

who casts an abstaining vote shall not be recorded as voting on either side of
the question.

236.07 INVESTMENT AND DEPOSITORY POLICY.
   (a)   Policy. It is the policy of the City to invest public funds in a
manner which will provide a market rate of return throughout budgetary and
economic cycles taking into account the safety and liquidity objectives of the
City and conforming to applicable state and local statues governing the
investment of public funds.
   (b)   Scope. This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the
City. Funds available for investment include all funds of the City as accounted
for in the City's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The Director of
Finance is authorized to pool cash balances from the several different funds of
the City for investment purposes. The interest earned from investments will be
credited to the fund proportionate to the amount invested.
   (c)   Prudence.
      (1)   The standard of prudence to be used by the Director of Finance in
the context of managing the overall portfolio shall be the prudent investor
rule, which states “Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.”
      (2)   The Director of Finance and staff, acting in accordance with
written procedures and exercising due diligence, shall not be held personally
responsible for a specific security's credit risk or market price changes,
provided that these deviations are reported as soon as practical and that
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
   (d)   Objectives. The primary objectives, in order of priority, of the
City's investment activities shall be:
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments of the City shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To
attain this objective, the City will diversify its investments by investing
funds among a variety of individual securities and financial institutions.
      (2)   Liquidity. The City's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the City to meet all operating requirements, which might be
reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return on investments. The City's investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the City's investment risk
constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (e)   Delegation of Authority.
      (1)   Authority to manage the City's investment program is delegated to
the Director of Finance per the City Charter. The Director of Finance shall
establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program
consistent with this investment policy. Such procedures shall include explicit
delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No
person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the
terms of this policy and the procedures established by the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken
and shall establish a system of controls to regulate activities of subordinate
staff members.
      (2)   The City may retain the services of an investment advisor, provided
the advisor is licensed by the Division of Securities under Ohio R.C. 1707.141
or is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and possesses
experience in public funds investment management, specifically in the area of
State and local government investment portfolios, or the advisor is an eligible
institution mentioned in Ohio R.C. 135.03.
   (f)   Ethics and Conflicts of Interest. The Director of Finance and any
other employee of the City who is involved in the investment process shall
refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper
execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to
make impartial investment decisions. The Director of Finance and any other
employee of the City who is involved in the investment process shall disclose
to the City Manager any material financial interests in financial institutions
that conduct business with the City, and she (he) shall further disclose any
personal financial investment positions that could be related to the
performance of the City's portfolio. The Director of Finance and any other
employee of the City who is involved in the investment process shall
subordinate her (his) personal investment transactions to those of the City,
particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales and shall refrain
from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with
whom business in conducted on behalf of the City.
   (g)   Authorized Financial Institutions and Dealers.
      (1)   The Director of Finance shall maintain a list of financial
institutions authorized to provide investment services. In addition, a list of
approved security broker/dealers which may include “Primary Dealers” or

15C3-1 (uniform capital rule) will be maintained. No public deposit shall be
made except in a qualified public depository as designated by the City.
      (2)   All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become
qualified bidders for investment transactions must provide:
         A.   Certification of having read the City's investment policy. Their
signature will be required indicating they have received, read, understand, and
will abide by its contents when recommending or selling investments to the
City.
   (h)   Authorized Investments. The Director of Finance may invest on behalf
of and in the name of the City in eligible securities and deposits, which are
defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 as amended. Eligible investments include but
are not limited to:
      (1)   U.S. government securities. Bills, notes, bonds, debentures, or any
other obligations or securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or any other
obligation guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States.

eligible obligations are strictly prohibited.
      (3)   Time certificates of deposit, savings accounts, and deposit
accounts. Interest-bearing time certificates of deposit, savings accounts, and
deposit accounts of any eligible public depository as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code, provided that any such deposits and savings accounts are properly

Investment Policy or such certificate of deposit is exempt from pledging
requirements as permitted under Ohio R.C. 135.144 (commonly referred to as the
CDARS program).
      (4)   Repurchase agreements (repo's). Before transacting a repurchase
agreement with a particular broker/dealer or eligible institution, a Master
Repurchase Agreement must be entered into between the City and such broker or
eligible institution. The term of a repurchase agreement may not exceed 30
days. Each Master Repurchase Agreement will provide for:
         A.   Collateralization of each repurchase agreement in accordance with

   (i)   Competitive Offers and Bids. All transactions will be completed on a
competitive basis, whenever possible, with offerings and bids being solicited
and recorded from three dealers. The purpose of soliciting competitive offers
and bids is to ensure that a market rate is obtained by placing Authorized
Financial Dealers and Institutions in competition with one another. The right
is reserved to reject any offer or bid yielding the highest return on any
investment if inconsistent with the City's investment strategy or objectives.
The Director of Finance will award transactions at his/her discretion.
   (j)   Safekeeping and Collateralization.
      (1)   If practical, investment securities purchased by the City will be

safekeeping receipt to the City listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity
and other pertinent information.
      (2)   Collateral will be required on two types of investments:
certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements. The collateralization level
will be as defined by the Ohio Revised Code. Collateral is limited to eligible
securities defined in Ohio R.C. 135.18 and 135.181. Each financial institution
with which the City has deposits shall provide a quarterly statement reflecting
the securities pledged including the market value of such securities.
   (k)   Diversification. The Director of Finance will diversify the portfolio
to avoid incurring unreasonable risks. In accordance with the Ohio Revised
Code, commercial paper and bankers acceptances are limited to a maximum of 25%
of the portfolio. No transaction needs to be executed when a maturity in the
portfolio causes the percentage to exceed the limit set forth above. Subsequent
investment transactions will work toward returning to compliance.
   (l)   Maturity. To the extent possible, the Director of Finance will attempt
to match the term to maturity of individual investments with anticipated cash
flow requirements. Maturities will normally be spread over a two-year range.
The maximum maturity is five years, except commercial paper and bankers
acceptances which will be limited to 180 days.
   (m)   Internal Control and Continuing Education.
      (1)   The Director of Finance is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an internal control structure designed to reasonably ensure that
the assets of the entity are protected from loss, theft, or misuse. The
internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance
that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes
that the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived
and the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by
management.
      (2)   Compliance with policies and procedures will be independently
reviewed during required audits by or on behalf of the Auditor of the State of
Ohio. This review will provide internal control by assuring compliance with
policies and procedures.
      (3)   The Finance Director will annually complete the continuing
education programs provided by the Treasurer of State of Ohio. Furthermore, no
investment shall be made in commercial paper or bankers acceptances unless the
Finance Director has completed the additional training approved by the Auditor
of the State of Ohio.
   (n)   Performance Standards. The investment portfolio will be designed to
obtain a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking
into account the City's investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio. The City's investment strategy is passive.
Given this strategy, the benchmark used by the Director of Finance to determine
whether market yields are being achieved shall be the rolling average of the
six-month U.S. Treasury bill.
   (o)   Reporting. The Director of Finance is charged with the responsibility
of providing reports on investment activity and returns on the pooled balance
of funds. These reports will be prepared on a monthly basis and submitted to
City Council. The reports will provide a clear picture of the status of the
current investment portfolio and should include the following:
      (1)   A listing of individual securities held at the end of the reporting
period by authorized investment category.
      (2)   Percentage of the portfolio represented by each investment
category.

Program, and to do all things necessary or proper for the administration of the
plan, consistent with the enabling statutes and all the rules and regulations
promulgated by the Board, whether in the Ohio Administrative Code or otherwise,
and consistent with the program adoption agreement executed by the City.

(Res. 94-23. Passed 10-18-94.)
248.03 CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND POLICE AND
FIREMEN'S DISABILITY AND PENSION FUND.
   (a)   Effective the first pay period after the passage of this section, the
full amount of the statutorily required contributions to the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio (PERS) and the Police and Firemen's Disability and
Pension Fund (PFDPF) shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person within
any of the classes established in subsection (b) hereof and shall be "picked-
up" (assumed and paid to PERS and PFDPF) by the City. This pick-up by the City
is, and shall be designated as, employee contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to PERS and PFDPF by each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (b) hereof. No person subject to this pick-up shall
have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to
PERS and PFDPF directly instead of having it picked up by the City or of being
excluded from the pick-up.
   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to the PERS and PFDPF,
report that the public employee's contribution for each person subject to this
pick-up has been made as provided by statute.
   (b)   The pick-up by the City provided by this section shall apply to all
persons who are employees of the City and who are or become contributing
members of the PERS and PFDPF over whom the City has the authority to
unilaterally make decisions concerning salaries wages.
   (c)   The City's method of payment of salary wages to employees who are
participants in the PERS and PFDPF is hereby modified as follows, in order to
provide for a salary reduction pick-up of employee contributions to the PERS
and PFDPF. The total salary/wages for each employee shall be the salary/wages
otherwise payable under the City's policies. Such total salary/wages of each
employee shall be payable by the City in two parts: (1) deferred salary/wages
and (2) cash salary/wages. An employee's deferred salary/wages shall be equal
to that percentage of that employee's total salary/wages which is required from
time to time by the PERS and PFDPF to be paid as an employee contribution by
the employee, and shall be paid by the City to the PERS and PFDPF on behalf of
that employee as a pick-up and in lieu of the PERS and PFDPF employee
contribution otherwise payable by that employee. An employee's cash salary/
wages shall be equal to the employee's total salary/wages, less the amount of
the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to applicable
payroll deductions, to that employee. The City shall compute and remit its
employer contributions to the PERS and PFDPF based upon an employee's total
salary/wages. The total combined expenditures of the City for such employers'
total salary/wages, payable under applicable City policies, and the pick-up
provisions of this section, shall not be greater than the amounts it would have
paid for those items had this provision not been in effect.
   (d)   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily
required contributions to the PERS and PFDPF for those persons reflected in
subsection (b) hereof so as to enable them to obtain the result in Federal and
State tax deferments and other benefits.

CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Pickerington has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Pickerington ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Pickerington, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C.
2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Fairfield County, if the offense is one committed in Fairfield
County, or to the Franklin County Municipal Court if the offense is one
committed in Franklin County, and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all
papers filed, together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to
date, and such recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule 23
(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense
cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by
the court unless he or she demands a jury trial. The jurisdiction of a Mayor's
Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules,
which provides that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23,
and the defendant waives his or her right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may
try the case only if (1) his or her compensation as a judge is not directly
dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief
executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such
responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no
contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Pickerington ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

(Res. 91-15. Passed 4-9-91.)
290.03 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF INCARCERATION.
   (a)   Any person convicted of an offense under these Codified Ordinances
which results in such person's incarceration shall pay to the City the actual
costs incurred by the City in housing such person in a jail facility. Such
costs shall include pre-conviction and post-conviction incarceration.
   (b)   The Mayor, if presiding over the Mayor's Court, or the Mayor's Court
Magistrate appointed by the Mayor to preside over the Mayor's Court, may waive
all or part of the incarceration costs where, because of the indigence of the
person sentenced, the payment of the costs would work an unreasonable hardship
on the person convicted, his or her immediate family or any other person who is
dependent on such individual for financial support, or for such other reason as
the Mayor or the Mayor's Court Magistrate may deem appropriate.
   (c)   In the event of nonpayment of any costs which have not been waived,
the City may seek to collect payment in any manner permitted by law for
enforcement of a debt.

while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially similar
to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is
substantially similar.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   Flashing Speed Indication. Vehicular traffic, on an approached
intersection, roadway or neighborhood, facing a flashing rectangular or square
speed signal indication, shall reduce speed to the speed limit applicable to
that location. (Ord. 2022-09. Passed 6-21-22.)
   (h)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (i)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by

made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

414.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child's or person's residence side of the road.
   (f)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section may be fined an
amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). A person who is issued a

citation in a trial but instead must appear in person in the proper court to
answer the charge.
      (2)   In addition to and independent of any other penalty provided by
law, the court or Mayor may impose upon an offender who violates this section a
class seven suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7). When a
license is suspended under this section, the court or Mayor shall cause the

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle- related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C.
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H.,(a)(1)I. or (a)(1)J.
or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a

analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician- paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.

ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C.4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio

permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving

requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of

independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other

proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under division
(h) of this section.

temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C.
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, the court shall suspend
any jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under
that section;
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has

arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.

Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.

nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that division, if both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (a)(1)J. of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined
in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.
(ORC 4511.19(G) - (M))

of this section.
      (3)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of this section, if a law enforcement officer has administered a
field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect what were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.

considers to be appropriate.
         B.   Division (o)(3)A. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (o) is guilty of having

impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, the Director or such
local authority may declare a minimum speed limit below which no person shall
operate a motor vehicle, except when necessary for safe operation or in
compliance with the law. No minimum speed limit established hereunder shall be
less than 30 miles per hour, greater than 50 miles per hour, nor effective

municipal ordinance, relating to appropriate signs, have been fulfilled and
local authorities have obtained the approval of the Director.
   (c)   In a case involving a violation of this section, the trier of fact, in
determining whether the vehicle was being operated at an unreasonably slow
speed, shall consider the capabilities of the vehicle and its operator.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under §

section.
      (2)   The Department of Transportation upon request from any local
authority shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of
any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if
it finds that such structure cannot with safety withstand traffic travelling at
the speed otherwise permissible under this Traffic Code, the Department shall
determine and declare the maximum speed of traffic which such structure can
withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating such maximum speed
to be erected and maintained at a distance of a least 100 feet before each end
of the structure.
      (3)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this
section, proof of such determination of the maximum speed by the Department and

guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

equipped with and displaying at least one flashing, rotating, or oscillating
light visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of 500 feet
to the front of the vehicle, and when the drivers thereof sound audible signals

operation of two or more vehicles side by side either at speeds in excess of
prima facie lawful speeds established by Ohio R.C. 4511.21(B)(1)(a) through (B)
(9) or a substantially similar municipal ordinance, or rapidly accelerating

the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court may impose upon the
offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. §
4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111
or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in
addition to or independent of any other sentence that it imposes upon the
offender, may order the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense
for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30 days in
accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any other
sentence that it imposes on the offender, may order the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense for 60 days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of this section, or any
combination of three or more violations of this section or R.C. § 4510.11,
4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the
court, in addition to any other sentence that it imposes on the offender, may
order the criminal forfeiture of the vehicle involved in the offense to the
state.
      (5)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section
shall be issued and enforced under R.C. §§ 4503.233 and 4507.02, as applicable.
The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to § 698.02
(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this section.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.
or division (b)(3)B. of this section.
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(3)B. of this
section, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be

698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with electronic
monitoring imposed under this division shall not exceed six months. If the
court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court
may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall
the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense exceed six months;
         B.   A fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and

may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so

   (c)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver's license under Ohio R.C. 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person

   (a)   No person whose driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, or nonresident's operating privilege has been
suspended shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public road or highway or any
public or private property after the suspension has expired unless the person
has complied with all license reinstatement requirements imposed by the court,
the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, or another provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person had not been reinstated by
the person at the time of the alleged violation of division (a) of this
section. The person charged with a violation of division (a) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to reinstate a
license, and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as provided in division (c)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
698.02, §
698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
698.02(d) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of a violation of division (a) of this
section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or been convicted of two
or more violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.21 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.

suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary driver's license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).

   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be
required to be restrained under this section has a physical impairment that
makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the
vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that

this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil

violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject

      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance
with or that is regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208
for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, knowing that the object is
not in accordance with that standard.

   (d)   No person shall knowingly sell, install, or reinstall a device in a
motor vehicle that causes the diagnostic system of a vehicle to inaccurately
indicate that the vehicle is equipped with a functional air bag.
   (e)   (1)   Whoever violates division (b) or (d) of this section is guilty
of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,
or offer for sale in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into

         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an

the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of

triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the

to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor

         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing
of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.

or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the
municipal corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service
shall give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability." Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication." Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   "Involuntary acts." Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession." A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11 ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.

608.04 FAILURE TO REPORT A CRIME OR DEATH.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in division (a)(2) of this section, no
person, knowing that a felony has been or is being committed, shall knowingly
fail to report the information to law enforcement authorities.
      (2)   No person, knowing that a violation of R.C. § 2913.04(B) has been

wound treated or observed by the person, or any serious physical harm to
persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.

the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is

this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under division (e) of this section.

professional counselor, independent marriage and family therapist, or marriage
and family therapist who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
patient or client has been the victim of domestic violence, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege
or advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground
for excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.

and patient; licensed psychologist or licensed school psychologist and client;
licensed professional clinical counselor, licensed professional counselor,
independent social worker, social worker, independent marriage and family
therapist, or marriage and family therapist and client; member of the clergy,

   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C. 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section
618.20 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 955.11.

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

672.03 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.

      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;

      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a

division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential

the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious

alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,

modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice.
   If the court grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable
contribution to the court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that
contribution into the general fund of the county, municipality, or other local

this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory

court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall

         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine
the extent of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount of
the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing provided that the amount of
restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or services
stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the court decides to impose
restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the
offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court
holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the
burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution
sought from the offender.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender's criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and
revision of this Model Ohio Municipal Code because substantially identical
State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

division shall be accepted by the City as the return required of an employee
whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages
reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer,
unless the City requires all resident individual taxpayers to file a tax return
under Section
880.23.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold Municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure

dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is

         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing

calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
880.06. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section

refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold Municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification

which the individual performed services at the refinery.

the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
   (i)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 880.18. This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld.
   (j)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX
880.13 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   Municipal taxable income for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
City is calculated as follows:
   (a)   Income reduced by exempt income to the extent otherwise included in
income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward equals Municipal taxable income.
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the net
profit of the taxpayer.
         A.   Net profit for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
880.06(c)(23).
         B.   Adjusted Federal taxable income is defined in Section
880.06(c)(1).
      (2)   Exempt income is defined in Section
880.06(c)(11).
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
880.14.
      (4)   Pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward is defined in Section
880.06(c)(32).
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.14 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the City unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City or the
taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone company that is
subject to and required to file reports under Ohio R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (i) of this chapter, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of Municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not-required to be withheld under Section 880.11;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the City may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
City;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section 880.41(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
880.41(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, wages, salaries, and other
compensation includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to an
employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (i) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a Municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
880.19.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
880.06(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (i)   (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under subsection (d) of this section, on qualifying wages paid to an
employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
         D.   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (i)(l)D.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (i)(1)D.1. or 2. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (a) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
            A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
            The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
            After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies
to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
            Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (a)
(l) through (a)(3) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer
that has made the election described in division (i)(2):
         A.   For the purpose of division (a)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (a)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (a)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (i) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (b)(1) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to division (d) of this section.

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.

   (b)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.
         B.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
Municipal income tax returns under division (b)(2) of this section; or
         C.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated Municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated Municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
Municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated Municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
880.06(c)(1), by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for
"federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under
880.06(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.14, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 880.14, include the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
880.14, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
880.14 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

880.16 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The City, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the City. If
a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the new income tax revenue the City derives from new employees of the taxpayer
and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years. Before the City passes an
ordinance granting a credit, the City and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.17 TAX CREDITS TO FOSTER JOB RETENTION.

retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding
fifteen years. Before the City passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the
City and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the
conditions of the credit.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City or Tax
Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in divisions (c)(1)A.
through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
880.23.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08.
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
880.29 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section 880.23 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
880.19 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER CITY.
   (a)   When the taxable income of a resident of this City is subject to a
Municipal income tax in another municipality on the income taxable under this
chapter, such resident shall be allowed a nonrefundable credit of the amount of
income tax paid on such taxable income to such other municipality, equal to
fifty percent of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate
of such other municipality or of this City by the taxable income earned in or
attributable to the municipality of employment or business activity. For the
purposes of this section, "taxable income" includes the distributive share of
net profits of a resident partner or owner of an unincorporated business
entity.
   (b)   The method of applying for a nonrefundable credit set forth in
division (a) of this section shall be as follows:
      (1)   No credit will be given unless the taxpayer claims such on his or
her final return or other form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, and
presents such evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality,
as the Tax Administrator may require. Subject to division (b)(2) of this
section, the credit shall not exceed the tax due the City under this chapter.
      (2)   A statement satisfactory to the Tax Administrator from the taxing
authority of the municipality to which the taxes are paid that a City resident
or his or her employer is paying the tax shall be considered as fulfilling the
requirement of this section.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.20 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the qualifying loss is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid Municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any Municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.21 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under Ohio
R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Ohio R.C.
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against
its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation, pursuant to Section
880.19.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.22 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the City, but should
have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by
the City as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
880.28.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the City, but
was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be subject to
collection and recovery by the City. To the extent a refund of such tax or
withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as provided in Section
880.28, the City will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other city against the income tax the City claims is
due. If the City's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference
of the tax rates is also subject to collection by the City, along with any
penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
880.28.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a City to allow credit for tax paid
to another municipal corporation if the City has reduced credit for tax paid to
another municipal corporation. Section
880.19 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
ANNUAL RETURN
880.23 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal taxable income by the City shall be completed and filed by every
taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax,
regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the City under Section 880.10(c) when the nonresident
individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages
reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer, and no

      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, eighteen years of age and older,
shall file an annual Municipal income tax return with the City, regardless of

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City in accordance with this chapter, the return or notice
required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the individual's
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such duly
authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged
with the care of the person or property of that individual shall provide, with
the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support that they are
authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. This notice
shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact information
including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by City. The Department of Taxation shall publish a method of
electronically submitting the documents required under this division through
the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department shall
transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to the
appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's Municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other Municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City or Tax Administrator.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the City or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter, the
Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
880.24 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section 880.24, the provision in Section
880.24 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount due
is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of this section.
   (i)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
880.10(b)(1)B. or C.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
880.10 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against
payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return. The return
or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the return, to contact
the Tax Administrator for information about the examination or other review of
the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond
to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator and has shown to the preparer
or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not
preclude the Tax Administrator from contacting the taxpayer regarding such
matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the City shall accept for filing a generic
form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the City in
accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form, once completed
and filed, contains all of the information required by ordinances, resolutions,
or rules adopted by the City or Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of the City's ordinance or resolution
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
880.11.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in Municipal taxable income reportable to the City in the taxable year.
It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of
this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of Municipal taxable income
on an annual Municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed
with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in division (n) of
this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the
person.

considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the City before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

division the application of divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City in accordance with this
chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this section,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) or

filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.

880.26 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a Municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the Municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of
Pickerington's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable
year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
   (f)   (1)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return under this section, the tax administrator shall not
make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return
on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the
extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
      (2)   If a tax administrator makes any inquiry or sends any notice to the
taxpayer as described in section (f)(1), the municipal corporation shall
reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to respond to such
inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (3)   This division does not apply to an extension received under
division (b) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (b) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under this division.

880.27 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the City in accordance with this
chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the Municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional Municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section 880.41 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section 880.41(a)(2) for
filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period prescribed in
that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of that division. If
the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no refund need be
paid by the City to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of
this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section 880.28. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.28 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
City, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of
employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the City:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 880.40.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
880.29(a)(4).

Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

order or in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or
the official business of the City as authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or the
charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the City or

this section with respect to prospective Municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the city in accordance with
this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the City's income
tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and conclusion of
the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the City's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the City in order to obtain a
more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
880.37.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be
appealed.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.39 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.40 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the City shall maintain a Local
Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the City, and may
not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the City at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the City. This member may be an employee of the City, but may not be the
director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other
similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or
any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the City shall be two years. There is no limit on
the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be reappointed by
the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top administrative
official of the City shall serve at the discretion of the administrative
official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-3-15.)
880.41 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section 880.40.
That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or holding
by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review with
which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section 880.28.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section 880.40, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section 880.28, with interest on that amount as provided by
division (d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

principal place of business in which the employee normally works is located in
another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax applying to
compensation paid to the individual for services performed on those days, and
the individual is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax on the

            2.   The individual is a professional athlete, the promoter of a
professional entertainment or sports event, or an employee of such promoter,
all as may be reasonably defined by the Municipality.
         B.   For purposes of the 12-day calculation, any portion of a day

shall begin withholding the Municipality income tax from remuneration paid by
the employer to the individual, and shall remit the withheld income tax to the
Municipality in accordance with Section
882.07 of the income tax ordinance. Since the individual can no longer be
considered to have been an occasional entrant, the employer is further required
to remit taxes on income earned in the Municipality by the individual for the
first 12 days. If the individual is self-employed or an independent contractor,
it shall be the responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate
income tax to the Municipality.
         D.   Any tax withheld for the Municipality under Section
882.03(a)(6) is subject to being refunded only to the Municipality in which the
employer's principal place of business is located, and only after that
municipality has established that the individual employee has a liability to
them.
   (b)   Determination of Portion of Net Profits Attributable to Municipality.
The portion of the net profits attributable to this Municipality of taxpayers
conducting a business, profession or other activity both within and without the

718.01 and 718.02 and in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by
the Administrator pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)   Operating Loss-Carry Forward. Notwithstanding any other provision

such losses may be carried forward for not more than one taxable year. There

882.03(d)).

addition to being a partner or member of another association or business, may
not be set off against the profits of the association or business, nor against
the salary, wage, other income, commission or other personal service
compensation (if any) which he or she may earn in another capacity. The
business loss of an association or business may not be set off against the
profits of another association or business engaged in by a member or partner of
such association or business, or against the salary, wage, other income,
commission or other personal service compensation which a member or partner may
earn in another capacity. In the case of an individual who runs two or more
businesses as individual proprietorships, loss from one such business may be
set off against the net profits of the other (but not against salaries, wages,
other income, or other personal service compensation). The one percent tax
shall be levied on the final net business income of the individual proprietor.

income tax purposes pursuant to IRC 1501 may file a consolidated return with
the Municipality. However, once the affiliated group has elected to file a
consolidated return or a separate return with the Municipality, the affiliated
group may not change their method of filing in any subsequent tax year without
written approval from the Municipality.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within this
Municipality constituting a portion only of its total business, the
Administrator shall require such additional information as he or she may deem
necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to this
Municipality. If the Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated
to this Municipality by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or
transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, or by some other method, he or she shall make such allocation as he
or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits
to this Municipality.
   (e)   Exceptions. The following shall not be considered taxable:

entertainment, welfare activities conducted by bona fide charitable, religious
and educational organizations and associations.
         A.   Any association or organization falling in the category listed in
this paragraph is required to file declarations and final returns and remit the

from which is not specifically exempt from taxation in Ohio R.C. 718.01.

producing business both within and without the corporate limits, it shall
calculate its profits allocable to this Municipality under the method or
methods provided above.

the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the

an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be
substituted by the Administrator or his or her delegate, so as to produce such
result.

      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a

year or other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be
filed on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the close of that

   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or charged with
the responsibility of filing the report and making payment, is personally

income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the Municipal
income tax return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the
taxpayer's request for a Federal filing extension with the individual or office
charged with the administration of the Municipal income tax. The request for
extension shall be filed not later than the last day for filing the Municipal
income tax return as prescribed by ordinance or rule of the Municipality. For
tax years prior to 2004, the Municipality shall grant such a request for
extension for a period not less than the period of Federal extension request.

following the month to which the due date of the Federal income tax return has
been extended. For taxable years subsequent to 2004, the extended due date
shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of the Federal income
tax return has been extended. The Municipality may deny a taxpayer's request
for extension if the taxpayer's income tax account with the Municipality is
delinquent in any way The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal
income tax return does not extend the last date for paying the tax without
penalty. No late fee shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended, but penalty and
interest shall be assessed on any unpaid tax which was due as of the original
tax filing deadline.

thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon,

882.07 or where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
882.08, or where an income tax has been paid to another Municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
882.17, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due, and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing such return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which this
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (f)   (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections
882.12 and
882.17. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e., either
cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing
the original return.

liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to this Municipality, such

882.03, and anticipates a tax liability of fifty dollars ($50.00) or more,
shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the estimated
profit or loss from such business activity, together with the estimated tax due
thereon, if any, provided, however, that if a person's income is wholly from
wages which the tax will be withheld and remitted to this Municipality in
accordance with Section
882.06, such person need not file a declaration.
   (b)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each
year during the life of this chapter, except that no penalties or interest
shall be assessed, for not filing a declaration, on any resident taxpayer who
was not domiciled in the Municipality on the first day of January of the year
in which they became subject to estimated payments, nor shall penalties or
interest be assessed on estimated payments if the taxpayer has remitted an
amount equal to 100 percent of the previous year's tax liability, provided that
the previous year reflected a 12-month period.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or
period.
   (c)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by, or
obtainable from, the Administrator, provided, however, that credit shall be
taken for this Municipality's income tax to be withheld from any portion of
such income. In accordance with the provisions of Section
882.17, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing Municipality.
      (2)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein. The safe harbor method shall be considered a good faith
estimate and no taxpayer shall be penalized for late payment or nonpayment of
estimated taxes by charging a penalty, interest or similar charge if the
taxpayer pays estimated taxes equal to 90 percent of the taxpayer's gross tax
liability for the current year, or 100 percent of the taxpayer's reported tax
liability for the preceding year, provided the return for the preceding year
reflected a twelve -month period and the taxpayer actually filed a return for
that year. A taxpayer shall not be penalized for the late payment or nonpayment
of estimated taxes if the taxpayer is a resident individual who was not
domiciled in the Municipal corporation on January 1 of the calendar year for
which the tax is due. (See division (b)(1) of this section).
   (d)   Such declaration or estimated tax to be paid to the Municipality shall
be accompanied by a payment of 22.5 percent of the estimated tax. An additional
payment of 22.5 percent of the estimated tax shall be due not later than the
15th day of the seventh month after the beginning of the taxable year, and a
payment of 22.5 percent of the estimated tax shall be due not later than the
15th day of the tenth month after the beginning of the taxable year and 22.5
percent of the estimated tax shall be due not later than the 15th day of the
12th month after the beginning of the taxable year. However, if amended
declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid
on the remaining payment date.
   (e)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which such declaration was required to be filed, an annual return
shall be filed and any balance which may be due this Municipality shall be paid
therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
882.05.
   (f)   Any installment remaining unpaid ten days after it becomes due shall
be liable to a penalty of ten percent of the amount owed and interest at the
rate of one and one-half percent per month or fraction thereof from the time
the estimated payment was due.
   (g)   Failure to file and pay a declaration and estimate within the
specified time period will result in a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fee for non-
compliance, in addition to the interest and penalty charge.
(Ord. 2002-141. Passed 1-7-03.)
882.09 DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to receive the tax
imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers, to
keep an accurate record thereof and to report all moneys so received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Administrator to enforce payment of all
taxes owing this Municipality, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six
years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration
and/or to make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and
amounts of payments thereof.
   (b)   The Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
the Board of Review, to adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and the
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns. Taxpayers are
hereby required to comply with said rules and regulations.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Administrator
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due this Municipality from the
taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written proposed assessment showing
the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon,
if any. A taxpayer may, within 30 days after the date the proposed assessment
was mailed, file a written protest with the Administrator stating the reasons
for protesting the assessment. If no protest is filed, the proposed assessment
shall become final and the amount so assessed become due. If a protest is
filed, then within 30 days after the filing the Administrator shall withdraw
the assessment, shall adjust the assessment, or shall reaffirm the assessment,
and it shall then become final. A protest of the final assessment may be filed
with the Board of Review only if the proposed assessment was protested with the
Administrator.
   (d)   The Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid
taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments, when the
taxpayer has proved to the Administrator that, due to certain hardship
conditions, he or she is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her under this chapter.
   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid
amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the
provisions of Sections
882.12 and
882.14 shall apply.
   (e)   The Administrator shall have the power to compromise any interest or
penalty, or both, imposed by Section
882.11.

   (a)   The Administrator, or any authorized employee, is hereby authorized to
examine the books, papers, records and Federal Income Tax Returns and State of
Ohio Income Tax Returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject
to, or whom the Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if
no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such
employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed
and required to furnish, within ten calendar days following a written request
by the Administrator, or his or her duly authorized agent or employee, the
means, facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and
investigations as are hereby authorized.

have knowledge of the facts to appear before him or her and may examine such
person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been
reported for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for
this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and Federal
Income Tax Returns and State of Ohio Income Tax Returns and the attendance of
all persons before him or her, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he or
she believes such persons have knowledge of such income information pertinent
to such inquiry. Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed
taxpayer, is hereby directed and required to furnish within ten days following
a written request by the Administrator, or his employee, the means, facilities
and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby
authorized.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal Income Tax
Returns and State of Ohio Income Tax Returns, the refusal to submit to such
examination by any employer or person subject or presumed to be subject to the
tax or by any officer, agent or employee of a person subject to the tax or
required to withhold tax, or the failure of any person to comply with the
provisions of this section or with an order or subpoena of the Administrator
authorized hereby, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, punishable as
provided in Section
882.99.
   (d)   Any information gained as a result of any returns, investigations,
verifications or hearings before the Administrator, required by this chapter or
authorized by these rules and regulations, shall be confidential and no
disclosure thereof shall be made, except for official tax purposes or as
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall divulge such
information in violation of this section.
   (e)   Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute his or
her tax liability for a period of six years from the date his or her return is
filed, or the withholding taxes are paid.

882.11 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and all moneys withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after
they become due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per
month.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in division (a) of this section,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   In the case of employers required to withhold taxes from employees
under the provisions of this chapter, a penalty shall be imposed at the rate
of:
         A.   10 percent of the amount of the unpaid tax if the tax is paid
within 30 days of the due date;
         B.   15 percent of the amount of the unpaid tax if the tax is paid
within 60 days of the due date;
         C.   20 percent of the amount of the unpaid tax if the tax is paid
within 90 days of the due date;
         D.   25 percent of the amount of the unpaid tax if the tax is paid
more than 90 days after the due date of the withholding tax.
      (2)   In the case of taxpayers who fail to file tax returns when due as
required by this chapter, a penalty in the amount as passed in the Annual Fee
Schedule shall be imposed.
      (3)   In the case of taxpayers who file tax returns but fail to pay taxes
due, other than taxes withheld, a penalty shall be imposed at the rate of ten
percent of the amount due.
      (4)   Filings shall be deemed to be timely made if postmarked by the due
date.
   (c)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Administrator, provided that, in
the absence of fraud, neither a penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit, provided that an
amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months
after a final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (d)   The Administrator may abate penalty or interest, or both, or upon an
appeal to the Board of Review from the refusal of the Administrator to
recommend abatement of penalty and/or interest, the Board may nevertheless
abate penalty or interest, or both.
(Ord. 2002-141. Passed 1-7-03; Ord. 2014-44. Passed 11-4-14.)
882.12 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes by this chapter shall be collectible, together with any non-
filing or late fees, interest and penalties thereon, by a civil action at law.
Except in the case of fraud, omission of 25 percent or more of income subject
tot his tax, or failure to file a return, all additional assessments shall be
made and all civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and penalties,
interest and non-filing or late fees thereon shall be brought within three
years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. In the
case of fraud, omission of 25 percent or more of income subject to this tax, or
failure to file a return, all additional assessments shall be made and all
prosecutions to recover Municipal income taxes and penalties and interest
thereon shall be brought within six years after the tax was due or the return
was filed, whichever is later.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for a
refund is made. Claims for refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought
within three years from the date on which such payment was made or the return
was due, or within three months after final determination of the Federal tax
liability, whichever is later. However, the following shall apply regarding
refunds of tax withheld from Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plans (NDCP).
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from an NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which Municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the non-qualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Pickerington, but
should have been deposited with another Municipality, is allowable by the City
of Pickerington as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds. Income tax that should have been deposited with the City, but was
deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the City.
The City will allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed the City that
is in excess of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality as long as
the tax rate of the other municipality is the same or higher than the City's
tax rate. If the City's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net
difference of the rates is also subject to collection by the City.
   (d)   Amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be collected or
refunded.

percent of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate of such
other municipality or of this Municipality by the taxable income earned in or
attributable to the municipality of employment or business activity. For the

Administrator may require.
      (2)   A statement satisfactory to the Administrator from the taxing

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation
of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or in several structures.

sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (d)   "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel or
transient accommodation and who furnishes the lodging.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX; PURPOSES.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City for the use of the General Fund of the City, for the advancement of
the cultural development of the community, for promoting and publicizing the
City as a desirable location for conventions, trade shows and similar events,
to encourage the patronage and business of cultural, educational, religious,
professional and sporting organizations and other organizations to utilize the
City and its numerous facilities for such events, and for the further purpose
of providing emergency human service needs to the community, all for the
benefit of the residents of the City, an excise tax of three percent is hereby
levied on transactions by which lodging in a hotel or transient accommodation
is or is to be furnished to transient guests, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5739.02(C)
(1).
   (b)   On and after the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 89-20,
passed April 18, 1989), all revenues received by the City from the hotel-motel
excise tax each year shall be divided for use in promoting and publicizing the
City as a desirable location for conventions, trade shows and similar events;
for use in purchasing cultural services for the enrichment of the community;
for emergency human service needs; and for the use of the General Fund of the
City without restriction.
   (c)   On and after the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 89-20,
passed April 18, 1989), the hotel-motel excise tax shall be three percent of
the amount paid or to be paid by the transient guest for the lodging. The tax
applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of
the time when the price is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to
the State, or to any of its political subdivisions, nor to any charitable
organization for the lodging of transient indigent individuals, when such
charitable organization pays the hotel or transient accommodation for such
lodging.
   (d)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels
to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.03 RESPONSIBILITY OF GUESTS AND VENDORS; EXEMPTIONS. 
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed that the tax applies.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.04 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Finance Director shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself or herself from the transient guest. When
such illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but
was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director on his or her agent,
the Director shall refund it to the transient guest. Applications shall be
filed with the Director, on a form prescribed by the Director, within ninety
days from the date it is ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal
or erroneous. However, such application for refund must, in any event, be filed
with the Director within four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous
payment of the tax. On the filing of such application, the Director shall
determine the amount of refund due. The Director shall draw a warrant for such
certified amount to the person claiming such refund. The Director shall make
such payments from a tax refund fund as established by ordinance.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.05 REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS. 
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction, if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Finance Director and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Director, in writing, consents
to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.06 RETURNS REQUIRED; PENALTY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. 
   Each vendor shall, on or before the twentieth day of each month, make and
file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Finance
Director, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due
from the vendor to the City for the period covered by the return and such other
information as the Director deems necessary for the proper administration of
this chapter. The Director may extend the time for making and filing returns.
Returns shall be filed by mailing the same to the Director, together with
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
   The Director may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as to
merit monthly returns, as determined by the Director upon the basis of
administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   The Director shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date they are
received by him or her and shall also show thereon, by stamp or otherwise, the
amount of payment received with the return. Any vendor who fails to file a
return under this chapter shall, for each day he or she so fails, forfeit and
pay into the City Treasury the sum of one dollar ($1.00).
   The Director may, if he or she deems it necessary in order to ensure the
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, require returns and payment to be
made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor
or his or her authorized agent.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.07 LIABILITY; ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES. 
   If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter and
fails to remit the same to the City as prescribed, he or she shall be
personally liable for any amount collected which he or she failed to remit. The
Director may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any information
in the Director's possession.
   If any vendor fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails to pay
the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction subject to
the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable for the
amount of tax applicable to the transaction. The Director may make an
assessment against either the vendor or the transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his or her possession.
   An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or pursuant
to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge the
transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable to
such transaction.
   In each case, the Director shall give to the vendor or the transient guest,
whoever is assessed, written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest personally or by registered or
certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to this chapter,
shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to an assessment
against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction, provided that
no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient guest for the tax
due on a particular transaction if such tax has actually been paid by another.
   The Director may make an assessment against any vendor who fails to file a
return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper amount of tax in
accordance with this chapter. When information in the possession of the
Director indicates that the amount required to be collected is, or should be,
greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the Director may, upon the
basis of test checks of a vendor's business for a representative period, which
checks are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which the tax required to be
collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's or transient accommodation's
lodging, which determination shall be the basis of an assessment as herein
provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall be made in the manner
prescribed in this chapter.
   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom the notice of assessment is
directed, files, within thirty days after service thereof, either personally or
by registered or certified mail, a petition, in writing, verified under oath by
such vendor, transient guest or his or her authorized agent, having knowledge
of the facts, setting forth with particularly the items of such assessment
objected to, together with the reasons for such objections, the assessment
shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable, from
the vendor or transient guest so assessed, to the Director. When a petition for
reassessment is filed, the Director shall assign a time and place for the
hearing of the same and shall notify the petitioner thereof by registered or
certified mail, but the Director may continue the hearing, from time to time,
if necessary.
   A penalty of fifteen percent shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Director may adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added to assessments
made under this chapter.
   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment as
provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Director, together with
penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days after notice
of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either personally or by
registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.08 FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS. 
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Finance Director has substantial evidence of the amount of
taxes collected by a vendor from transient guests' lodging which was not
returned to the City; or
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.09 PAYMENT BY TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS. 
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging, as furnished, is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.10 COLLECTION OF TAX BY VENDOR; REFUNDS OR REBATES PROHIBITED. 
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he or she is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient
guest by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at the price including
the tax or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.11 FILING OF REPORTS; FRAUDULENT REPORTS. 
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, for two consecutive months or for three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any vendor authorized by the Director to file returns at less frequent
intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month period, to
file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Director may
require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the average tax
liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by the Director
from a review of returns or other information pertaining to such vendor, which
amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). The
security may be in the form of an advance tax payment to be applied to pay the
tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the
Director and conditioned upon payment of the tax due with the returns from the
vendor. The security must be filed within ten days following the vendor's
receipt of the notice from the Director of its requirements.
   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to the
vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.12 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. 
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the City under this chapter fails, for any reason, to make such filing or
payment, any of its officers or employees having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making payments, shall be
personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation shall not
discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of the
corporation to file returns or remit the tax due. The sum due for such
liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in this
chapter.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.13 INTENT OF CHAPTER. 
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy an excise tax of six percent on
transactions by which lodging in a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient
guests, as referred to in Ohio R.C. 5739.02 (C)(1) and (C)(2), and, further, to
levy an excise tax of six percent on transactions by which lodging in transient
accommodations is or is to be furnished to transient guests. Accordingly, this
chapter shall be construed to effectuate those purposes and so as to be
consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a prerequisite
to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 89-20. Passed 4-18-89.)
884.99 PENALTY. 
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first offense. For each
subsequent offense, such person shall, if a corporation, be fined not more than

(Ord. 2018-12. Passed 8-7-18.)
1028.05 APPLICATION REVIEW TIMEFRAMES AND PROCESS.
   (a)   Permit Application Review Timeframes.
      (1)   Collocation of small cell facilities on existing wireless support
structures. The City shall grant or deny its consent for requests to collocate,
or to replace or modify a small cell facility on, or associated with, an
existing wireless support structure not later than ninety days after the date
of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (2)   New wireless support structures and associated small cell
facilities. The City shall grant or deny its consent for requests to construct,
modify, or replace a wireless support structure associated with a small cell
facility within the right-of-way not later than 120 days after the date of
filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (3)   Wireless support structure and/or small cell facilities removal.
The City shall grant or deny its consent for requests to remove wireless
support structures associated with small cell facilities from the right-of-way
in a reasonable time.
      (4)   Eligible facilities request. The City shall approve eligible
facilities requests in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 4939,47 C.F.R. §
1.40001, and this chapter not later than sixty days after the date of filing by
an entity of a submitted application.
   (b)   Failure to Grant or Deny Within Prescribed Timeframes. If the City
fails to approve or deny a request for consent under this section or a request
for a relevant work permit within the timeframes required under Section
1028.05 (a), provided the time period is not tolled under §
1028.05 (d) or extended with the written consent of the applicant and the City,
the request shall be deemed granted upon the requesting entity providing notice
to the City that the time period for acting on the request has lapsed.
   (c)   Application Denials.
      (1)   The City shall not unreasonably withhold or deny consent for small
cell facilities and wireless support structures within the right-of-way.
      (2)   If a request for consent is denied, the City shall provide in
writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence, and such information as the applicant may reasonably
request to obtain consent. The denial of consent shall not unreasonably
discriminate against the entity requesting the consent.
      (3)   Except in the case of a public utility subject to the jurisdiction
and recognized on the rolls of the public utilities commission or of a cable
operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the “Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984,” 98 Stat. 2779,47 U.S.C.A. 541, the City,
for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to any person
based upon the person's failure to possess the financial, technical, and
managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   (d)   Tolling of Required Timeframes.
      (1)   The time periods required in Section
1028.05(a) may be tolled only:
         A.   By mutual agreement between the entity requesting consent and the
City;
         B.   In cases where the City determines that the application is
incomplete, as provided in division (d)(2) of this section; or
         C.   If the number of requests for consent for small cell facilities
or wireless support structures received is likely to result in difficulty
processing applications within the time limits set forth in Section
1028.05(a) due to the lack of resources of the City, then the City may toll the
time limits as follows:
            1.   The time period may be tolled for up to twenty-one days for
the first fifteen small cell facility or wireless support structure requests
received by the City above the thresholds provided in the table below within
any consecutive thirty-day period:
 
Population of City at time Small Cell Facility or     Number of
Wireless Support Structure Applications are received: Applications:
30,000 persons or less                                15 applications or more
30,001 to 40,000 persons                              20 applications or more
40,001 to 50,000 persons                              25 applications or more
50,001 to 60,000 persons                              30 applications or more
60,001 to 100,000 persons                             60 applications or more
 
            2.   Further, for every additional fifteen requests that the City
receives above the thresholds provided in the table above, the City may toll
the time period for those requests for up to fifteen days in addition to the
time period provided in division (d)(l)C.1. of this section.
            3.   In no instance shall the City toll the time period for any
small cell facility or wireless support structure request by more than ninety
consecutive days. Upon request, the City shall provide an operator written
notice of the time limit for a small cell facility or wireless support
structure request.
      (2)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the City shall provide
written notice to the person requesting consent not later than thirty days
after receiving the request, clearly and specifically delineating all missing
documents or information. The missing documents or information shall be
reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of
applicable federal and state law. Any notice of incompleteness requiring other
information or documentation, including information of the type described in
Ohio R.C. 4939.0313 or documentation intended to illustrate the need for the
request or to justify the business decision for the request, in accordance with
state and federal law, does not toll the time period for incompleteness.
      (3)   The time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the
entity makes a supplemental submission in response to the City's notice of
incompleteness.
      (4)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the City shall notify
the person requesting consent not later than ten days after receiving the
supplemental submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the
information identified in the original notice that delineated missing documents
or information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or
subsequent notices under the procedures identified in divisions (d)(1) to (d)
(3) of this section. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not
specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the
original notice of incompleteness.
   (e)   Consolidated Application for Multiple Small Cell Facilities And/or
Wireless Support Structures.
      (1)   Applicants seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more
than one small cell facility or more than one wireless support structure may
file, at the applicant's discretion, a consolidated application for up to 30
small cell facility requests or up to 30 wireless support structure requests in
a single application and receive a single permit for the construction,
modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell facilities or
wireless support structures subject to the following:
         A.   This single application may be filed for multiple small cell
facilities or multiple wireless support structures only if they are of
substantially the same type.
         B.   The City may separately address small cell facility collocations
or wireless support structures for which incomplete information has been
received or which are denied.
      (2)   In the case of a consolidated application, the fees provided for in
Ohio R.C. 4939.0316 and Section
1028.09 shall be cumulative. However, the City, at its discretion, may opt to
reduce such fees to encourage consolidated application submittals.
      (3)   In the case of a consolidated application, each small cell facility
or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified, collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for purposes of
tolling the response deadline as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4939.036. A request
by a single operator for a new or replacement support structure and associated
small cell facility constitutes one request.
   (f)   Timeframe for Completion of Permit.
      (1)   Permits granted for collocations of small cell facilities on
existing wireless support structures, new wireless support structures and/or
associated small cell facilities shall be completed by the operator or its
agent within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless:
         A.   The City and the operator agree to extend this period; or
         B.   A delay is caused by make-ready work for a City-owned wireless
support structure or decorative pole or by the lack of commercial power or
backhaul availability at the site, provided that:
            1.   The operator has made a timely request within sixty days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services; and
            2.   The additional time to complete installation does not exceed
360 days after issuance of the permit.
      (2)   If divisions (f)(1)A. and B. of this section cannot be met, the
permit shall be void unless the City grants an extension in writing to the
operator.
   (g)   Small Cell Facility and Wireless Support Structure Activities Not
Requiring Consent. City consent shall not be required for either of the
following activities conducted in the right-of-way:
      (1)   Routine maintenance of wireless facilities;
      (2)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are consistent with the City's current design requirements and guidelines
and that are either:
         A.   Substantially similar to the existing wireless facilities; or
         B.   The same size or smaller than the existing wireless facilities.
(Ord. 2018-12. Passed 8-7-18.)
1028.06 DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (a)   The City Manager shall promulgate detailed design guidelines with
objective, technically feasible criteria applied in a non-discriminatory manner
that reasonably match the aesthetics and character of the immediate area
regarding all of the following, which the City shall consider in reviewing an
application:
      (1)   The location of any ground-mounted small cell facilities;

design guidelines so long as the information, materials, or requirements do not
conflict with state or federal law.
   (d)   The City Manager shall have authority to update or supplement The
design guidelines to address relevant changes in law, technology, or
administrative processes. In the event of any conflict between the design
guidelines and the standards articulated in this chapter of the City of
Pickerington Code of Ordinances, the language of this chapter shall take
precedence over the language of the design guidelines.
(Ord. 2018-12. Passed 8-7-18.)

applicable provisions of 47 C.F.R. §§22.970-22.973 and 47 C.F.R. §§90.672-
90.675, which define unacceptable interference, state the obligations of FCC
licensees to abate unacceptable interference, provide interference resolution
procedures, and set forth discretionary information exchange between public
safety licensees and other licensees. In the event that the City has reason to
believe that an operator's operations are causing interference with the City's
public safety radio communications operations, then the operator shall, at its
cost, immediately cooperate with the City to either rule out operator as the
interference source or abate the interference as set forth by the
aforementioned FCC regulations.
   (i)   Adverse Physical Impacts on Adjacent Properties. Operators shall

made invalid as well. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
remaining provisions would have been adopted had such invalid provisions not
been included in this chapter when originally adopted by Council.
(Ord. 2018-12. Passed 8-7-18.)
1028.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter, any

or where the water is finally discharged freely at atmospheric pressure.
(1980 Code § 911.01)
1040.02 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   Rules and regulations for the operation of the Municipal water supply system
may be promulgated by the Manager or his or her designee or any comparable
successor, for the purpose of ensuring the safe, economic and efficient
operation of the Municipal water supply system. These rules and regulations
shall have the same validity as Municipal ordinances when not repugnant
thereto, or when not repugnant to or in contravention of the Constitution or
laws of the State.
(1980 Code § 911.02)
1040.03 CROSS-CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established, or maintain or permit to be maintained, any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the Municipality may enter the supply or distribution system of
the Municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and
method of connection and use of such supply has been approved by the
Municipality and by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (b)   The Municipality shall cause surveys and investigations to be made of
all properties served by the public water supply where private, auxiliary or
emergency water supplies other than the public water supply are known to exist
or where such supplies are likely to exist. Such surveys and investigations
shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated as often as the
Municipality deems necessary.
   (c)   Municipal personnel shall have the right to enter at any time any
property served by a connection to the public water supply or distributing
system of the Municipality for the purpose of inspecting the piping systems
thereof. On demand, the owner, lessee or occupants of any property so served
shall furnish any information which Municipal personnel may request regarding
the piping systems and any private, auxiliary or emergency water supply used on
such property. The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within
the discretion of the Manager, be deemed evidence of the presence of improper
connections as provided in this section.
   (d)   The Municipality is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue,
after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service to any
property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this section
is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as may be
deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored
until such connection has been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the
provisions of this section.
(Ord. 226. Passed 6-8-60.)
   (e)   If, in the judgment of the City Manager, an approved backflow
prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water system, the
City Manager will give notice to the water consumer to install such device
immediately. The water consumer shall, at his or her own expense, install such

meter or other regulator, operating or measuring device, or appliance in or
attached to the wells, tanks, reservoirs, conduits, pipes, mains, service
pipes, house pipes or other pipes or apparatus of the Municipality, with intent
to cause the escape of water or to injure or destroy such property.
   (b)   No person shall tap, sever, open or make any unauthorized connections
with a water meter, main or pipe used or intended for the transmission of
water.
   (c)   This section does not apply to Municipal representatives with regard
to duties per formed in the official scope of their employment, nor does this
section apply to anything done by or under authority of any regularly
constituted fire department.
(Ord. 75 CC. Passed 10-7-75.)
1040.99 PENALTY.

1042.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, certain terms are defined as follows:
   (a)   "Available frontage" means the frontage for all parcels which abut on
the water main. On corner parcels the frontage shall be the shortest frontage
which abuts on a street right of way. Parcels which already abut on a water
main shall not be considered as part of the available frontage.
   (b)   "Contract areas" means areas served with water by the Municipality
where a contract exists between the Municipality and a political subdivision.
   (c)   "Corner parcel" means a lot or parcel abutting on two or more
intersecting streets.
   (d)   "Front foot" means the frontage which abuts on the street right of
way. On corner parcels it shall be the shortest frontage so abutting. When the
property to be served does not abut upon a street right of way, "front foot"
means the width of the parcel.
   (e)   "Noncontract areas" means areas outside the Municipality served with
water by the Municipality where no contract exists with a political
subdivision.
   (f)   "Service connection" means the connection of all or any part of the
service line to the tap.
   (g)   "Service line" means the line extending from the tap onto the premises
to be served and includes all the necessary pipes, lines and appurtenances from
the tap to and including the meter.
   (h)   "Tap" means the connection to the water main and the necessary pipes
or lines extending from the water main to and including the curb stop or valve
and box.
   (i)   "Water service outside the Municipality" means water service furnished
to con sumers in contract areas or water service authorized by the Manager for
consumers in noncontract areas.
(Ord. 77 L. Passed 4-26-77.)
1042.02 CONNECTION CHARGES.
   (a)   Nonassessed Property. Each applicant for a water tap, at the time of
application, shall pay ten dollars ($10.00) per front foot of the property to
be served if located within the Municipality and ten dollars and fifty cents
($10.50) per front foot of the property to be served if located outside the
Municipality, provided that this charge shall not be imposed for the
replacement of a tap or increase in size of an existing tap, and provided
further that this charge shall not be imposed if the owner of the property
concerned can show that he or she or his or her predecessor in title paid or is
paying a special assessment for the construction of any of the water mains
which provide such service or, at his or her own expense, constructed any of
the water mains which provide such service. This subsection (a) does not apply
to owners of lots in a properly developed subdivision whose water lines have
been built by a developer and dedicated for public usage.
(Ord. 77 L. Passed 4-26-77; Ord. 86-22. Passed 5-6-86.)
   (b)   Main Line Taps. Taps of a water main shall be done totally at the
expense of the applicant for water service under the inspection of the Water
Department. Proper installation procedures, materials and restoration shall be
required. The use of private contractors is encouraged.
(1980 Code § 913.02(b))
1042.03 MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   The Manager is authorized to provide water service to new consumers when he
or she determines that the water main extension is feasible both economically
and from an engineering point of view and will not be detrimental to the best
interests of the Municipality, giving consideration to the overall effect on
the total water system and to the long-term plans and probable future growth of
the water system of the Municipality.
(Ord. 77 L. Passed 4-26-77.)
1042.04 CHARGE FOR MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (a)   Contract Areas (Outside the Municipality). All water main extensions
in areas having a contract with the Municipality for water service shall be
installed and paid for as specified in the contract.
   (b)   Noncontract Areas (Outside the Municipality).
      (1)   All water main extensions in areas having no contract with the
Municipality for water service shall be installed and paid for the developer,
applicant or political subdivision requesting such service at no expense to the
Municipality, regardless of the size of the water main installed or the length
of extensions.
      (2)   The specifications and standards of construction for all water main
extensions shall be approved by the Municipal Engineer.
      (3)   The size of all water mains shall be determined by the Municipal
Engineer and shall be large enough not only to serve the areas under immediate
consideration, but also to serve areas which are likely to be developed and
which should be served by the water main under consideration. Unless otherwise
approved by the Municipal Engineer, no water main shall be smaller than six
inches nominal diameter.
      (4)   All extensions of water mains shall include the installation of all
taps, valves and fire hydrants. The number and location of fire hydrants shall
be in accordance with standards established by the Municipal Engineer and shall
be installed and paid for by the applicant or developer under the supervision
of the Engineer. The number and location of all taps and valves shall be as
required by the Municipal Engineer.
      (5)   All water mains and appurtenances shall be owned, operated and
maintained by the Municipality, with title to be vested in the Municipality
upon completion of the water main.
   (c)   Within the Municipality.
      (1)   All water main extensions in the Municipality shall be paid for by
the applicant or developer requesting such extension. Where a water main
extension is required by the Municipality to be installed larger than eight
inches in nominal diameter, the Municipality shall pay the difference in the
cost of the pipe, fittings and valves between the installation of an eight-inch
water main and the water main installed.
      (2)   The Municipal Engineer shall determine from Municipal records or
other sources the cost of the pipe, fittings and valves, and this determination
shall be final.
      (3)   The Municipal Engineer may approve water main extensions to be
installed by a qualified developer and he or she shall determine whether the
water main shall be installed by the Municipality or by the applicant or
developer.
      (4)   For each water main extension requested and installed by the
Municipality, the Municipal Engineer shall make an estimate of the total costs
involved and the applicant or developer shall make a deposit to the
Municipality that is sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the water main
extension. If the actual cost of the extension is higher or lower than the
deposit, the applicant or developer will be refunded the amount of any excess
deposit or shall pay to the Municipality any deficit that may exist in the
deposit, as the case may be.
      (5)   When water main extensions are installed by the Municipality, the
cost may be assessed against the abutting property owners, with the approval of
Council. Such assessment shall be in an amount equal to the total installation
cost, unless the line is required by the Municipality to be larger than eight
inches. When the water main is required by the Municipality to be installed
larger than eight inches, the amount assessed shall be the total installation
cost, less the difference in the cost of the pipes, fittings and valves between
the installation of an eight-inch water main and the water main installed. The
costs shall be determined as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) hereof.
      (6)   The specifications and standards of construction for all water main
extensions shall be subject to the approval of the Municipal Engineer.
      (7)   The size of all water mains shall be determined by the Municipal
Engineer and shall be large enough not only to serve the areas under immediate
consideration, but also to serve areas which are likely to be developed and
which should be served by the water main under consideration. Unless otherwise
approved by the Municipal Engineer, no water main shall be smaller than six
inches nominal diameter.
      (8)   All extensions of water mains shall include the installation of all
taps, valves and fire hydrants. The number and location of fire hydrants shall
be in accordance with the requirements of the Municipal Engineer. The number
and location of all taps and valves shall be as required by the Municipal
Engineer.
(Ord. 79-69. Passed 12-18-79.)
      (9)   A.   No water mains shall be installed except by the Municipality
unless authorized by an agreement between the Municipality and the developer or
applicant. Where water mains are installed by a developer or an applicant and
abut on parcels not owned by such developer or applicant, nor included in the
agreement, the developer or applicant shall be entitled to reimbursement when
such parcels are connected to the water main within ten years after the
completion of the water main, from the funds collected by the Municipality for
such connections pursuant to Section
1042.02. The amount of the reimbursement shall be determined by the Manager,
with Council's concurrence on a line-by-line basis, and shall not exceed the
cost of the water line installation, less the front foot cost to the
developer's or applicant's property served. In no event shall the total amount
of reimbursement be less than five dollars ($5.00) per front foot of property
served. The amount of such reimbursement shall be set by the Manager within
sixty days after the developer or applicant has complied with paragraph (c)
(9)B. hereof.
         B.    To be eligible for this reimbursement, the developer or
applicant shall file with the Municipality, within ninety days after the
completion of the water main or such further time as may be authorized by the
Manager in accordance with the standards and specifications, receipts for all
labor and material used in connection with the construction of the water main,
together with final, as-built plans, properly referenced for future location of
the work.
(Ord. 88-67. Passed 8-16-88.)
      (10)   The Manager shall issue a letter of completion within thirty days
after he or she receives a certified cost of construction statement as herein
provided. The water mains and other appurtenances shall, effective as of the
date of the letter of completion, become the property of, and title shall
immediately vest in, the Municipality, its successors or assigns.
(Ord. 79-69. Passed 12-18-79.)
1042.05 WATER LINE EXTENSION FUND.
   There is hereby established a special fund which shall be used exclusively
for the deposit of water main front foot connection charges and for the payment
of reimbursements to developers for offsite extensions.
   Moneys received and dispersed pursuant to the authorization of this section
shall be accounted for on a project-by-project basis so that reimbursement to
developers is directly related to water main front foot connection charges paid
by owners of properties abutting their improvement.
(Ord. 77 L. Passed 4-26-77.)
1042.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree and shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both, for each offense. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues.

1050.02 CALCULATION OF BILLS.
   (a)   Basis of Calculation. For the January, 2003, billing all water bills
will be figured on the basis of the amount of water used in the previous
quarter ending December 31, 2002. Once the quarterly bill is calculated, this
amount shall be divided into fourths and one-fourth billed each month (January,
February, March, and April, 2003), such bill to issue by no later than the
fifth of each month and paid by the fifteenth of each month.
   (b)   Monthly Billing. Beginning in January, 2003, water meters will be read
during the last week of each month. After January, 2003, with the first bill in
February, 2003, all water bills will be calculated based on the previous
month's meter reading. Customers will receive two water bills in February,
March, and April of 2003. They will be paying for the last quarter usage of
2002 and the previous month's usage. After April, 2003, they will pay only for
the previous month's reading.
   (c)   Calculation of Bills for Mingo Estates. For the January, 2003,
billing, all water bills will be figured on the basis of the amount of water
used in the previous quarter ending December 31, 2002. As currently required,
the entire amount for the fourth quarter of 2002 will be due January 15, 2003.
Starting with the meter reading for January, 2003, the billing will become
monthly, due the fifteenth of the month following the meter reading. The first
monthly bill will be due February 15, 2003.
   (d)   Move Ins. The minimum monthly charge shall be prorated according to
the move-in date.
   (e)   Move Outs. The minimum monthly charge shall be prorated according to
the move-out date.
(Ord. 81-13. Passed 3-3-81; Ord. 2002-130. Passed 11-5-02.)
1050.03 PAYMENT AND LATE PAYMENT .
   All water, sewer service, and stormwater utility bills shall be payable
monthly by the fifteenth day of the month in which they are due.
   All such bills shall be subject to a late charge of ten percent of the net
amount due if not paid on or before the fifteenth of the month in which they
are due.
   Failure to receive a bill through the mail, loss of a bill, payment through
a courtesy payment service, or absence due to vacations do not constitute
eligible grounds for exemption from the late charge. Payments by mail shall be
postmarked no later than the fifteenth day of the month. For utility customers
with unforeseen circumstances or unknown leaks, the Manager or designee may
forgive a payment or portion thereof, workout a payment plan with at least
fifty percent of the outstanding bill paid immediately for a term not to exceed
six months and/or suspend the late charge.

   Any person or business offering courtesy payment services for payment of
utility bills as provided for in Chapters
1050,
1060 and
1067 of these Codified Ordinances shall prominently post a sign notifying
customers that "Payment through this courtesy service is not payment to the
City. Please allow sufficient time for transmission of payment by the fifteenth
of the month. Any late charges are the customer's responsibility." Payments
received by such courtesy payment service shall be promptly forwarded to the
City.
(Ord. 2002-140. Passed 2-18-03.)
1050.04 NONPAYMENT.
   Failure to pay for service by the fifteenth day of the month following the
month in which a bill is due shall constitute grounds for shut off.
Notification of shut off will be sent by U.S. mail, and notice shall also be
posted at the service location one day prior to actual shut off.
   Where water service has been turned off for nonpayment of a bill, before any
new service is connected, a person seeking reconnection shall pay a
reconnection fee to the Municipality of fifty dollars ($50.00). Payments must
be received before 3:00 p.m. to have the service reconnected in the same day.
The reconnection of services shall occur during business hours. The City
Manager, at his or her discretion, may require a reconnection deposit to
guarantee payment of further bills in the amount not to exceed one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00).
(Ord. 2002-130. Passed 11-5-02; Ord. 2008-05. Passed 2-19-08.)

rendered, to the extent permitted by the laws of the State of Ohio.

into use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without
first obtaining a written permit from the Manager.
   (b)   The owner or his or her agent shall make application on a special form
furnished by the Manager. The permit application shall be supplemented by
plans, specifications or other information required by the Subdivision
Regulations or other Municipal ordinances. A permit and inspection fee for a
residential building sewer permit, a commercial building sewer permit and an
industrial building permit, as set forth in the General Fee Schedule (see
Chapter 208 of the Administration Code), shall be paid to the Municipality at
the time the application is filed.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1056.02 INSPECTION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any sewer installer or individual who installs his or her own sewer
shall, at the time of the connection, notify the Manager advising him or her
that the connection is ready for inspection.
   (b)   Within forty-eight hours from the time of the receipt of such notice,
the Manager or his or her designee shall make an inspection and approve or
disapprove the connection, in writing. If the connection is disapproved, the
owner, contractor, builder or any person in charge of such connection shall,
within forty-eight hours thereafter, cause the necessary corrections to be made
in the work and shall again notify the Manager, who shall authorize the
reinspection.
   (c)   If, upon reinspection, such connection is still found not to be in
conformity with Municipal ordinances and regulations, the applicant shall be
required to pay an additional fee as set forth in the General Fee Schedule (see
Chapter 208 of the Administration Code) for each and every reinspection
required. Such fee is to be deposited and paid to the Administrator at the time
the application for reinspection is made.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1056.03 CONNECTIONS IN NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Every person, firm or corporation who or which is the developer or
builder of any area within the Municipality shall, at the time that basement
footers or foundation footers are constructed, install the sanitary sewers into
the foundation. Floor drains and waste pipe drains shall be stubbed off, within
the house, at a height of three feet from the ground level, measured within the
basement or foundation, and shall be capped or sealed with a water-tight cap or
seal to the satisfaction of the Municipality.
   (b)   No developer or builder, or any agent thereof, shall remove the cap or
seal, or permit the entry of water or any liquid into the sanitary sewer prior
to the completion of the plumbing lines. If the Municipality determines that a
sanitary sewer opening has not been capped or sealed or that the cap or seal
has been removed or that water, liquids or other extraneous material has
entered the sanitary sewer, the holder of the zoning permit shall be prima-
facie liable for a violation of this section.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1056.04 COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING SEWERS.
   All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of a

Municipality from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1056.05 SEPARATE BUILDING SEWERS REQUIRED; OLD SEWER USAGE.
   (a)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining court, alley, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer. In special cases, this regulation may
be extended to include three or more users when an approved cleanout well is
provided at the upper end of the lateral forming the multiple service building
sewer, following the proper sizing of the sewer by the Municipal Engineer and
approval in writing by the Manager.
   (b)   Old building sewers may be used for connection with public sewers only
after an examination to determine the type of construction and then only after
testing to determine their water tightness. They shall be tested in a like
manner as used for the public sewers and the cost of such testing shall be
borne by the owner. Evidence of the examination shall be placed on file in the
office of the Manager, who shall, after such examination, give the owner,
tenant, contractor or lessee, a letter stating that the sewer has been tested
and is satisfactory for use as a sanitary sewer connection to the public sewers
of the Municipality.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1056.06 CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)   A building sewer shall be of a quality and of such materials as shall
be compatible to the sewage system installed, and the standard specification
for selected sewer pipes shall be equal to Armco Solid Wall ABS pipe, having a
stiffness factor (F/Y) of 150, when determined in accordance with Section 8.3
of ASTM-D2680 at five percent minimum deflection. Any approved equal shall be
determined by the Municipal Engineer, who shall certify the same to the
Manager. The Manager shall permit such use only after such certification by the
Municipal Engineer. If the building sewer is installed in filled or unstable
ground, the building material of the sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe,
except that nonmetallic materials may be approved if laid on a suitable
concrete bed or cradle as approved in writing by the Municipal Engineer or his
or her agent.
   (b)   The size and the slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the Manager, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four
inches for a single service and six inches for parts of lines serving
additional services. The slope of such sewer shall not be less than one-eighth
inch per foot, except by special written approval from the Manager.
   (c)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be
weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment,
insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly
curved pipe and fittings.
   (d)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (e)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench-work unless otherwise approved by the Manager. Pipe laying
and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification (C1219),
except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected.
   (f)   All joints shall be made gas-tight and water-tight. The building sewer
shall be connected with the building drain by use of a special adapter designed
for the material involved.
   (g)   The connection of the building sewer with the public sewer shall be
made at the wye branch, stub, or end of a six-inch branch, if such branch is
available, using special fittings provided for this purpose.
   If no such branch is provided, saddles of reducing wye types shall be
installed in the public sewer to enable a connection with Armco Solid Wall ABS
pipe, or an approved equal, by the owner, and as directed by the Manager or his
or her designee.
   (h)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricade and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Municipality.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.))
1056.07 AUTHORITY OF MANAGER RE ISSUANCE OF SANITARY SEWER TAPS.
   The City Manager is hereby authorized to refuse to issue sanitary sewer taps
to any applicant when he or she determines that the issuance thereof would put
an unreasonable demand upon the existing wastewater treatment system and/or
would be contrary to the best interests of the community.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1056.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter shall
be served by the Manager with written notice stating the nature of the
violation and providing a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days, for the
satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time
stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
   (b)   Any person who continues any violation beyond the time limit provided
for in subsection (a) hereof is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be
fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each violation. Each day
in which any such violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
   (c)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the Municipality for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by
reason of such violation.

1058.06 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COST OF INSTALLATION OF SANITARY SEWER COLLECTOR
LINES.
   (a)   No sanitary sewer collector line(s) shall be installed except by the
Municipality, unless otherwise authorized by an agreement between the
Municipality and a developer or an applicant. Where sanitary sewer collector
lines are installed by a developer or an applicant and abut on parcels not
owned by such developer or applicant, nor included in the agreement, the
developer or applicant may be entitled, if approved by Council, to seek
reimbursement from the Municipality if such parcels are connected to sanitary
sewer lines running to the treatment plant within ten years after the
completion of the sanitary sewer collector line. Any reimbursement shall come
from funds paid by the owners of the newly connected parcels pursuant to
Section
1058.01. The amount of the reimbursement shall be determined by dividing the
cost of the sanitary sewer collector line installed by the developer or
applicant by the available frontage abutting on the sanitary sewer collector
line. The total amount of reimbursement shall not exceed five dollars ($5.00)
per front foot of property served.
   To be eligible for this reimbursement, the developer or applicant shall file
with the Municipality, within ninety days after the completion, in accordance
with the Municipality's standards and specifications, of the sanitary sewer
collector line, or such further time as may be authorized by the Manager, in
writing, receipts for all labor and material used in connection with the
construction of the sanitary sewer collector line, together with the final as-
built plans, properly referenced for future location of the work.
   (b)   The Manager shall issue a letter of completion within thirty days
after he or she receives a certified cost of construction statement and final
as-built plans as herein provided. The sanitary sewer collector line and other
appurtenances shall, effective the date of the letter of completion, become the
property of and title shall immediately vest in the Municipality, its
successors or assigns.
   (c)   There is hereby established a special fund which shall be used
exclusively for the deposit of sanitary sewer line front foot connection
charges and for the payment of reimbursements to developers for offsite
extensions.
   Money received and disbursed pursuant to the authorization of this section
shall be accounted for on a project-by-project basis so that reimbursement to
developers is directly paid and relates to sanitary sewer line front foot
connection charges paid by owners of properties abutting their improvement.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1058.07 PREPAYMENT OF SYSTEM CAPACITY CHARGES.
   The developer, owner or subdivider of any finally platted lands in the
Municipality may, if he or she so elects, prepay the connection fees subject to
the provisions of other ordinances and resolutions. However, if charges are
increased between the time of prepayment and the time the service connection is
made, the owner, developer or subdivider shall pay the difference between the
new rates and the prepaid fees at the time the connection is actually made.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1058.08 WAIVER OF CAPACITY CHARGES PROHIBITED.
   Elimination, abatement, reduction or deferral of any fees or assessments
and/or costs of installation of sewer or water lines will not be granted for

5-16; Res. 2023-13R. Passed 4-4-23.)
   (b)   Computation of Usage.
      (1)   For any building, dwelling or other structure connected to the
Municipal sanitary sewers and also connected to the Municipal water system, the
usage, for the purpose of a determination of the amount of charges due, shall
be based upon the water usage as shown by the water meter located upon such
premises.
      (2)   Any person, being the owner or occupant of premises not connected
to the Municipal water system, shall be required to install, at his or her
expense, a water meter, and all water used for domestic, commercial or
industrial purposes shall pass through such meter and charges for use of the
sanitary sewer shall be based upon such water usage.
      (3)   If any person or occupant of any private dwelling refuses, neglects
or fails to install a water meter, then the water and sanitary usage shall be
determined on an EDU basis. (See Section
1054.01(a)(16) for the definition of EDU).
      (4)   In those cases in which sanitary sewer customers are served by
their own private wells, and in those cases where the private well, because of
impurities such as mud or sand, fouls the operation of the water meter which is
used in determining the sanitary sewer usage, the Manager shall have the
authority to:
         A.   Remove the water meter; and
         B.   Establish a sanitary sewer use rate based upon an estimated
average usage. Sanitary sewer customers who do not agree with the established
rate shall have the right of appeal to the Service Committee of Council, who
shall be the final board of determination.
   (c)   Industrial Users. Service to industrial establishments may be by
contract if the Municipality deems this to be in its best interest. However, in
the absence of a contract, charges shall be made in accordance with
Chapter 1062.
   (d)   Measurement of Volume. The volume of sewage measured for payment for
each account shall be as follows:
      (1)   When the user is supplied with water from the Municipal water
system, the quantity of water measured for payment shall also be the quantity
of sewage measured for payment.
      (2)   When the user is supplied with water from the Municipal water
system and only part of the water enters the sewer system, the Manager may
require or permit the installation of an additional meter to measure the
quantity of sewage actually entering the sewer system. The meters shall be
approved by the Manager and furnished, installed and maintained at the expense
of the user.
      (3)   When the user is supplied with water, in part or in total, from a
source other than the Municipal water system, the Manager shall require the
installation of meters to measure the supply of water from all sources or to
measure the volume of sewage entering the sewer system. The meters shall be
approved by the Manager and furnished, installed and maintained at the expense
of the user.
      (4)   All sewage entering the sewer system shall be measured for payment.
All meters required under this section shall be furnished and installed at the
expense of the user. All defective meters shall be replaced at the expense of
the user.
      (5)   The Manager may require from the user that the Municipality be
furnished, upon request, with information and data on all sources of water
within the confines of the premises which may enter the sewer system.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00; Ord. 2006-91. Passed 10-3-06.)
1060.02 BILLING AND NONPAYMENT.
   Bills for rates and charges are herein established by the Municipality and
shall be sent monthly. All bills shall be payable on the fifteenth day of the
month following the period of service and shall be paid at the office of the
Utility Administrator. If any charge for the services of the system shall not
be paid by the fifteenth day of the month in which it becomes due and payable,
a charge of ten percent of the amount of the bill shall be added thereto and
collected therewith. If any bill for the service of the sewer system remain
unpaid after 30 days following the rendering of the bill therefor, the water
supply for the lot, parcel of land or premises affected shall be cut off and
shall not be turned on again except on payment in full of the delinquent
charges therefor, in addition to the payment of a turn-on charge of fifty
dollars. ($50.00). Payments must be received before 3:00 p.m. to have the
service reconnected in the same day. There is an additional fifty dollar
($50.00) charge for reconnection after normal business hours.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00; Ord. 2002-130. Passed 11-5-02.)
1060.03 LIEN; CERTIFICATION AND COLLECTION.
   All sewer charges levied pursuant to this chapter constitute a lien upon the
premises charged therewith, and if the same are not paid within sixty days
after the due date, the charges shall be certified to the Auditor of Fairfield
County, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate, together with the
charges or penalties allowed by law, which shall be collectible as other
Municipal taxes.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1060.04 SEWER REVENUE FUND.
   All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the sewer system shall
be paid to and held by the Manager separate and apart from all other funds of
the Municipality and all of such sums and all other funds and moneys incident
to the operation of the sewer system, as may be delivered to the Clerk, shall
be turned over to the Finance Director to be deposited in a separate fund
designated the Sanitary Sewer Revenue Fund. The Finance Director shall
administer such Fund in every respect in the manner provided by the Ohio
Revised Code and all other laws pertaining thereto.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1060.05 ACCOUNTING.
   (a)   The Finance Director shall establish a proper system of accounting and
shall keep proper records, books and accounts in which complete and correct
entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the sanitary sewer
system.
   (b)   The sewer service charge shall be reviewed annually by the City in
order to determine whether or not it is sufficient to defray costs for debt
service and OM&R of the sewerage system and to re-proportion allocated costs
between debt service and OM&R if necessary.
   (c)   Each user is to be notified as least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill, of that portion of the sewer service charge which is attributable
to OM&R costs of wastewater treatment services.
   (d)   Every person whose premises are served by said sewage works shall be
charged for the services provided. No user shall be granted service without
charge.
(Ord. 2000-40. Passed 6-6-00.)
1060.06 METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
   The methodology showing the calculation of the total sewer service charge
shall be as set forth herein:
   USER CHARGE RATE FOR NORMAL DOMESTIC SEWAGE
      C u = Unit Cost ($/1,000 gal)
      C t = Total OM&R Cost($)
      F t = Total Flow (gallons)
      C u = C t / (F t / 1,000 gal)
         Sample Calculation:
            C t = $500,000 (Total OM&R Cost)
            F t = 200,000,000 gal (Total Flow)
            C u = $500,000 / 200,000,000 gal / 1,000 gal)
            C u = $2.50 / 1,000 gal
   SURCHARGE RATES FOR TREATMENT PARAMETERS
      P u = Unit Cost to Treat Parameter ($/ lbs.)
      P t = Total Cost to Treat Parameter ($)
      P w = Total Weight of Parameter Treated (lbs.)
      P u = P t / P w
         Sample Calculation:
            P t = $48,000 (Total Cost to Treat Parameter)
            P w = 600,000 lbs. (Total Weight of Parameter Treated)
            P u = $48,000 / 600,000 lbs.
            P u = $0.08 / lbs.
      P u = Cost per pound surcharge levied per pound over the limits for
normal domestic wastewater as stated in Section
1054.01(a)(32).
         DEBT SERVICE CHARGE
            D a = Annual Debt Payment
            F t = Total Flow (gallons)
            D u = Debt Service Charge Unit Cost ($ / 1,000 gal)
            D u = D a / (F t / 1,000)
               Sample Calculation:
               D a = $700,000 (Annual Debt Payment)
               F t = 200,000,000 gal (Total Flow)
               D u = Debt Service Charge Unit Cost ($ / 1,000 gal)
               D u = $700,000 / (200,000,000 gal / 1,000)
               D u = $3.50 / 1,000 gal

1067.01 CHARGES ESTABLISHED.
   It is hereby determined necessary for the protection of the public health,
safety, and welfare that a system of charges for utility service be established
which justly and equitably allocates the cost of providing the services of the
utility to each property.
(Ord. 2000-140. Passed 1-16-01.)
1067.02 PURPOSE.

solely for the operations, maintenance, repair, improvement and extension of
the utility; to provide for the safe and efficient capture and conveyance of
stormwater; to mitigate the damaging effects of stormwater runoff and the
correction of stormwater problems; to fund activities of stormwater management,
including, but not limited to, design, planning, regulation, education,
coordination, inspection and enforcement activities, all for the protection of
the public health, welfare, and safety.

maintain adequate fund reserves to provide for reasonable expected variations
in the collection of stormwater utility charges, in the cost of providing
services, and in the demand for services.
   Subsequent to the initial establishment of stormwater utility charges
pursuant to this chapter, the City Manager, in each odd-numbered year, shall
prepare a utility report with recommended stormwater utility charges. This
report shall contain data utilized in the determination of the recommended
stormwater utility charges and shall be presented to the Council on or before

year.
   The City Manager shall biennially notify, in conjunction with the billing
process, all persons subject to these charges of changes in the stormwater
utility charge.
(Ord. 2000-140. Passed 1-16-01.)
1067.06 METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING STORMWATER UTILITY CHARGE.
   For the purpose stated in this chapter, there is hereby charged to each
utility user and property, lot, parcel of land, building or premises
(collectively “properties”) situated within the corporate limits of the City,
that is tributary directly or indirectly to the stormwater system, stormwater
utility charges determined as provided in this section.
    All properties having an impervious area within the City shall be assigned
an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof, which will be a
minimum one ERU.
    All improved single-family residential properties are assigned one ERU. A
flat rate will apply to all single-family residential properties. All improved
single-family residential properties are determined to include impervious areas
typical of a single-family residence.
    All properties having an impervious area which are not improved single-
family residential properties are to be assigned by the City Manager an ERU
multiple based upon eighty percent of the properties' estimated impervious area
(in square feet) divided by 2,530 square feet (one ERU). This division will be
calculated to the second decimal place.
    The stormwater utility charge shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month per
Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU), which shall be effective January 1, 2011,
through December 31, 2011. After December 31, 2011 the stormwater utility
charge shall be four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25) per month per
Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) which shall be effective from January 1, 2012
through December 31, 2012. After December 31, 2012, the stormwater utility
charge shall be four dollars and fifty cents ($4.50) per month per Equivalent
Residential Unit (ERU).
    There shall also be a stormwater system capacity charge of six hundred
dollars ($600.00) per ERU for each building permit for new (non-existent)
housing or commercial start, effective from and after January 1, 2001. Such fee
shall be increased by three percent for each of the years following 2001. The
rate for water supplied by the Municipality for all customers shall be as
follows:
   The stormwater utility charge shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month per
Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU), which shall be effective from January 1,
2011 through December 31, 2011.
   The stormwater utility charge shall be four dollars and twenty-five cents
($4.25) per month per Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU), which shall be
effective from and after January 1, 2012 until December 31, 2012. Effective
from and after January 1, 2013, the stormwater utility charge shall be four
dollars and fifty cents ($4.50) per month per Equivalent Residential Unit
(ERU).

Passed 11-15-11.)
1067.07 BILLING AND NONPAYMENT.
   The bill for stormwater utility charges shall be rendered on a monthly basis
and shall be billed with the monthly bill for water service for those property
owners or condominium associations who or which are billed only for water
service; shall be billed with the charges for sanitary sewer service; shall be
billed with the charges for water and sanitary sewer service for those property
owners or condominium associations who or which are billed for those services;
or billed alone to those property owners or condominium associations not billed
for water or sanitary sewer service by the City. The stormwater utility charges
prescribed in this chapter are due and payable when rendered. If stormwater
utility charges are paid after the fifteenth day from the billing date, a
penalty of ten percent shall be assessed.
(Ord. 2000-140. Passed 1-16-01.)
1067.08 APPEALS.
   An owner may challenge the ERU multiple assigned to the property by filing
an appeal with the City Manager. The appeal shall be in writing and shall state
the grounds for the appeal. The appeal shall be filed with the City Manager
within 180 days after receipt of notice of the ERU multiple assigned to the
property. The City Manager shall have ninety days to investigate the matter,
unless the City Manger determines additional time is necessary for his or her
review. The City Manager shall cause appropriate investigation to be made,
determine whether an adjustment of the ERU multiple for the property is
necessary, and adjust the assigned ERU multiple if appropriate. The appellant
shall be notified in writing of the City Manager's determination with respect
to the appeal and of any resulting adjustment in the amount of the stormwater
utility charge.
(Ord. 2000-140. Passed 1-16-01.)
1067.09 LIEN; CERTIFICATION AND COLLECTION.
   Each stormwater utility charge and applicable penalty rendered under or
pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a lien upon the property to which it is
applicable, and, if the same is not paid within ninety (90) days after it is
due and payable, it shall be certified to the auditor of the county in which
the property is located, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the
county with the interest and penalties allowed by law and be collected as other
taxes are collected. As an alternative to collection of a delinquent stormwater
utility charge and applicable penalty pursuant to certification to a county
auditor, delinquent stormwater utility charges and applicable penalties may be
recovered in an action at law by the City.
(Ord. 2000-140. Passed 1-16-01.)
1067.10 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The City Manager shall promulgate rules and regulations which allow for a
credit in the stormwater utility charge for properties other than single-family
residential properties. These rules and regulations may allow, where
appropriate, application of the credits retroactive to the effective date of
this chapter. The City Manager shall have the authority to charge a stormwater
utility charge credit application fee, which shall be based upon estimated
costs of reviewing, processing and administering the credit application.

1210.01   SHORT TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the
“Access Code of Pickerington, Ohio,” or just the “Access Code,” and are
hereinafter referred to as these regulations.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1210.02   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these regulations is to provide standards and criteria for
review and approval of driveways, curb cuts and intersections of new or
existing public roads with other public or private roads or streets.
   (a)   The efficiency and safety of a roadway facility, with limited access
control, or without access control, depends greatly on the amount and character
of roadside interference. Most of this interference originates in vehicular
movements to and from residential, commercial and industrial developments along
the facility.
   (b)   The rights of abutting property owners for access is realized, but it
is necessary for controls to be established regarding the number, location and
geometrics of access points. This is necessary to maintain good operational
characteristics on the facility and to provide adequate safety features for the
expeditious movement of people and goods.
   (c)   Roadway interference resulting from excessive roadside development and
uncontrolled driveway connections precludes the orderly and safe movement of
traffic in and out of private properties and therefore results in poor levels
of service, increased hazards and early obsolescence of the roadway.
   (d)   The necessary regulations and geometrics of access points are very
closely associated with traffic volumes and operations, rights-of-way, land use
and zoning control.
   (e)   It is understood that commercial and industrial growth within an
expanding metropolitan area is inevitable. Therefore, it is necessary to
provide access to these concerns in accordance with a well developed plan, as
compatible as possible with the adjacent roadway facilities, as it can easily
be shown that traffic congestion adversely affects conditions for transacting
business, produces accidents, interferes with the effective operation of fire
and police forces, and, in general, reduces the enjoyment of many phases of
urban life and activity.
   (f)   Access from lands adjacent to, but not part of, the Municipality must
be carefully controlled to protect roadway integrity and the free passage of
traffic from all sites.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1210.03   SCOPE.
   These regulations apply within the incorporated areas of the Municipality.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1210.04   OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of these regulations are as follows:
   (a)   To promote greater safety of passage between roadway and land;
   (b)   To improve the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on the
roadway;
   (c)   To increase and protect the capacity of the roadway; and
   (d)   To protect the reasonable economic development of the land.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1210.05   SEPARABILITY.
   If, for any reason, any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part of
these regulations should be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, such judgment shall not affect the validity of these regulations as a
whole, or any part thereof, other than the part so held to be invalid.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1210.06   RELATION TO OTHER LAWS.
   The provisions of these regulations shall supplement any and all laws of the
State, ordinances of the Municipality and rules and regulations promulgated
under authority of such laws or ordinances relating to the purpose and scope of
these regulations. Whenever the requirements of these regulations are at
variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules,
regulations, ordinances or resolutions, the more restrictive or that imposing
the higher standard shall govern.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1210.07   DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions for these regulations are found in the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)

1258.14
1218.01   ISSUANCE OF PERMITS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF ACCESS DRIVEWAYS; CONDITIONS.
   (a)   The issuance of a temporary permit for the construction of access
driveways will be considered under the following circumstances:
      (1)   Existing roadways with normal access control which are scheduled
for improvement;
      (2)   Existing roads designated as primary or secondary arterials which
have not been constructed to their planned size or number of lanes; or
      (3)   Existing facilities which have been designated “limited access
controlled roadways.”
   (b)   The designation of an existing roadway as a limited access controlled
facility has brought about special problems related to the issuance of permits
for access driveways. This is especially true where the actual implementation
of limited access control features is delayed for some period of time after the
designation order and no program for acquiring access rights has been
undertaken.
   (c)   There are many cases under these conditions where a property owner
abutting a facility which has been designated a limited access controlled
roadway is considering the development of commercial property. In some
circumstances, the property owner or developer might be willing to risk
obtaining a considerable return on his or her investment if he or she could
have direct access to the roadway during the period in which plans are being
developed and a right-of-way obtained for physical conversion to a limited
access control status.
   (d)   Under these and similar circumstances, and if the same is in
compliance with the regulations of the Municipality, temporary access permits
for the construction of driveways may be granted to abutting owners, provided
the proposed improvements to the property do not increase the cost of acquiring
right-of-way and access rights.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1218.02   ISSUANCE OF PERMITS FOR ACCESS TO DESIGNATED LIMITED ACCESS CONTROL
HIGHWAYS, ETC.
   The granting of temporary permits for access to designated limited access
controlled highways, and to roadways and streets with normal control of access
scheduled for improvement, will be considered where such permits will be
accepted by the owner or developer with the inclusion of a suitable clause
protecting the Municipality against improvement costs. Permits should be
prominently labeled Temporary Driveway Permit. The permit should then contain a
paragraph worded essentially as follows:
   “The applicant hereby states that he/she is the owner of record of the tract
of land to be served by the access driveway described herein, such land being
situated in the County of ________________________, State of Ohio, and
described as follows: ________________________.
   The applicant understands that the above described driveway is within the
limits of designated limited access control, or the limits of an existing or
proposed public right-of-way, and that such entrance will be removed or revised
at such time as the Municipality completes negotiations for access rights to
the property or right-of-way. It is further understood that the applicant will
not claim additional damages because of the existence of the driveway described
herein. It is also understood that this permit is accepted with the full
understanding that any improvement or construction on the property after
____________________ shall not be considered as increasing the value of the
rights of access or right-of-way at such time as these rights are obtained for
the purpose of developing the adjacent facility. It is understood that this
permit will expire and may be renewed within one year from the date of issue or
upon negotiation of the right-of-way, whichever is latest.”
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1218.03   RECORDING OF PERMITS.
   Since temporary permits will have a direct bearing on the acquisition of
access rights and rights-of-way in the future, they are to be recorded in the
deed or abstract and duly recorded with the proper agency. In case the property
under permit changes ownership before the facility is physically converted to a
limited access control facility, or improved, as the case may be, a recorded
permit will be more effective in maintaining the rights of the Municipality as
noted in the application.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1218.04   APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND CRITERIA.
   The standards and criteria previously outlined for all driveways to roadway
facilities shall also govern temporary permits.
(Ord. 89-56. Passed 7-5-89.)
1218.05   NOTIFICATION OF OWNER OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Every effort should be made by the Municipality to apprise the owner of the
proposed improvements and to make him or her aware of the future means of
access which will be available to his or her property.

Director shall reinspect the property to determine whether each violation
contained in the notice of violation has been removed. If the Development
Services Director is unable to reinspect the property on the compliance date
set forth in such notice, then the person served with the notice may serve upon
the Development Services Director an affidavit setting forth the facts showing
compliance with the notice, and such affidavit shall serve as notice of

area maps and flood routing maps shall be submitted with the construction
plans. Construction may not begin prior to the approval of such plans by the
Engineer and the provision of a surety assuring approved installation and
initial maintenance of the required improvements. The City Engineer shall
determine the adequacy of the surety.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1258.23   CITY MAINTAINED DETENTION BASINS.
   (a)   Storm water retention and detention basins are required by the City
development and engineering standards. City policy encourages the perpetual
ownership and maintenance of such facilities by property owners or by groups of
property owners acting together in an association. Sometimes such ownership is
not practical or cannot be accomplished.
   (b)   In order to qualify for perpetual maintenance of a detention basin by
the City, the property owner who is responsible for building the basin must
build it as a non-flow-through type detention basin.
   (c)   Exhibit A, below, illustrates a typical profile of such a basin. In
addition, the property owner must pay to the City a fee of three thousand five
hundred dollars ($3,500) per acre or portion thereof, payable prior to the
construction of the basin (measured from A to B on the Exhibit). There is a
minimum fee of seven thousand dollars ($7,000). This fee shall be deposited by
the Finance Director and interest only as needed shall be transferred to the
Street Department budget to pay for the cost of an estimated eight mowings and
one sewer jetting per year, as well as the cost of insurance and other
incidental expenses.
   (d)   It is intended that such detention basins will provide passive park
areas. They are to be relatively flat, generally dry when not flooded, and have
durable and sufficient grass cover. The City Engineer is required to approve
grasses, grading, slopes, installation of all drainage systems, and the
adequate growth of all ground cover before accepting the project. A fee simple
deed to the detention area shall be granted to the City at the time of
acceptance of the project. When the City Engineer determines that it is
necessary, the deed shall also provide a permanent access easement twenty feet
in width.

evidence supporting the existence of unforeseen delays. In the event the
developer requests such hearing, no action shall be taken by the City under
this provision, until the Planning and Zoning Commission conducts a hearing and
makes a determination as to the existence of any such unforeseen delays. If the
developer fails to complete the construction of required improvements in
accordance with this chapter, and unless unforeseen delays are found by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, or unless the plat is otherwise extended by
Council, the platting process shall begin anew for the uncompleted phases and
previous approvals for such phases shall be null and void. In the event a plat
does become null and void in accordance with the provisions set forth herein,
the City shall cause a vacation plat, cross-referencing the original plat to be
duly recorded with the County Recorder.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1258.31   ACCEPTANCE BY THE MUNICIPALITY.
   Upon completion of all the improvements, a final inspection report shall be
filed by the Engineer. If the Engineer states that the improvements were

1266.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   "Caliper" means the diameter of a tree trunk six inches above the
existing grade or proposed planted grade. This measurement is used for nursery-
grown trees.
   (b)   "Critical root zone" means the area inscribed by an imaginary line on
the ground beneath a tree having its center point at the center of the trunk of
the tree and having a radius equal to one foot for every inch of diameter
breast height (DBH).
   (c)   "Diameter breast height (DBH)" means the diameter of a tree measured
at four and one-half feet above the existing grade at the base of the tree.
   (d)   "Drip line" means the ground area within the tree's canopy.
   (e)   "Protected tree" means any tree having a trunk diameter of six inches
or greater as measured twenty-four inches above ground level, or a tree which
has been designated by the City to be of high value or interest to the City
because of its location or historical association, or other professional
criteria.
   (f)   "Tree" means any self-supporting woody plant, together with its root
system, growing upon the earth usually with one trunk, or multi-stemmed trunk
system, supporting a definitely formed crown.
   (g)   "Tree preservation area" means the area of a parcel of land in which
all trees shall be protected during all phases of construction.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1266.03   REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   All protected trees shall be preserved unless exempted, as follows:
the City Manager, or his or her designee, may approve the cutting down,
removal, or destruction of a protected tree when the tree interferes with the
proper development of a lot, provided that the lot is the subject of
application for approval of a zoning certificate, a site plan, a development
plan, a variance, or a conditioned use permit and one of the following applies:
      (1)   Trees are located within a public right-of-way or easement.
      (2)   Trees are located within the area to be covered by proposed
structures or within fifteen feet from the perimeter of structures, and the
proposed structures cannot be located in a manner to avoid removal of trees at
the same time permitting desirable and logical development of the lot.
      (3)   Trees are located within the driveway access to parking or service
areas or proposed driveway designed to service a single-family house.
      (4)   Trees are within proposed parking lots. Efforts shall be taken to
locate and protect said trees in planting areas and islands.
      (5)   Trees that in the judgment of the City Manager, or his or her
designee, are damaged, diseased, over-mature, which interfere with utility
lines, or are an inappropriate or undesirable species for that specific
location.
   (b)   When preparing and reviewing subdivision plans and landscape plans,
good-faith effort shall be made to preserve natural vegetation areas. Streets,
lots, structures, and parking areas shall be laid out to avoid the unnecessary
destruction of heavily wooded areas or outstanding tree specimens. Developers
of land are encouraged to designate heavily wooded areas as park reserves.
   (c)   All preliminary and/or final development plans, when submitted, shall
show all existing individual trees having a trunk diameter of six inches or
greater as measured twenty-four inches above ground level with all proposed
streets, lots, structures, utilities, and parking areas. Prior to the removal
of any trees, a site inspection by the City Manager, or his or her designee,
shall be performed. This inspection shall mark those trees permitted for
removal, the delineation of areas to be preserved and any other construction
restrictions. The removal of any trees and/or shrubs is prohibited until said
site inspection is completed.
   (d)   The owner shall be responsible for the construction, erection, and
maintenance of temporary fencing or other physical barrier around the tree
preservation areas so that all protected trees shall be preserved. All required
protective fencing or other physical barrier must be in place around the tree
preservation area and approved by the City prior to the beginning of
construction, including site clearing and grading. The fencing or other
protective barrier must be located, at a minimum, outside the critical root
zone, or the drip line, or fifteen feet, whichever is greater, unless otherwise
approved by the City Manager, or his or her designee. The fencing or other
physical barrier must remain in place and be secured in an upright position
during the entire construction period to prevent impingement of construction
vehicles, materials, spoils, and equipment into or upon the tree preservation
area. Tree protection signs, available from the Planning and Zoning Department,
shall be secured to the fencing every fifty feet. Any change in the protective
fencing must be approved by the City Manager, or his or her designee.

the action requested. Where a dismissal would result in a hardship to others in
attendance, the Commission may, by majority vote of the members present,
consider the matter in question.
      (2)   The Commission will reconsider only substantially revised plans,
matters referred by Council or matters supported by a majority of members

own Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson from among its voting members in January
of even-numbered years or as the position becomes vacant.

presentation, following the applicant's presentation.

items raised by opponents or interested parties.

Chairperson may rule that person out of order.
      (15)   A hearing shall be informal to the maximum possible extent. Strict
rules of evidence shall not apply, and procedures may vary somewhat to ensure a
fair hearing so long as all those who desire to speak or present evidence are
sworn in under oath. The purpose of a hearing is to bring out sufficient
evidence and information to permit the Commission to arrive at a just result.
When rules of procedure become an issue, the official copy of Robert's Rules of
Order shall govern.

Director's office. Copies may be obtained upon payment of a fee.

   (a)   Any rezoning application or other matter which must be acted upon by
the Planning and Zoning Commission may be tabled by the Commission upon the
request of the applicant. The applicant shall pay a one-time fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) per application for such tabling request. Such tabling may be
done by the Development Services Director or by the Chairperson if it is

the Commission shall consider the impact on those citizens present in ruling on
the request to table.

Commission prior to being considered by the Service Committee.
   (c)   An applicant may not request that a rezoning application be tabled at
any Service Committee meeting and such an application shall not be tabled more

application denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission may be later
withdrawn, causing unfairness to citizens, is discussed above. Subsection (d),
hereof sets up a situation where withdrawal must occur prior to a Planning and
Zoning Commission vote on an application. If withdrawal occurs after the
Planning and Zoning Commission vote, the resubmittal time limits become
effective.)

revised to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a period of at least six
months. A rezoning application which has been previously withdrawn and
previously resubmitted and/or revised shall not be resubmitted for at least a
twelve-month period.

1272.09   VARIANCES AND APPEALS GENERALLY.
   (a)   Use Variances Generally. On a particular property, extraordinary
circumstances may exist that make strict enforcement of the applicable
requirements of this Code unreasonable. Therefore, a procedure for variance
from these requirements is provided to allow the flexibility necessary to adapt
to changed or unusual conditions, both foreseen and unforeseen, under
circumstances which do not ordinarily involve a change of the primary use of
the land or structure permitted. Variances shall be heard by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, except in matters of primary and secondary arterials as stated
in Section
1232.05 and in matters of Council variances as stated in subsection (c) hereof.
In order for the Board of Zoning Appeals to grant a variance, all of the
following conditions must exist:
      (1)   The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or
land in question are peculiar to such lot or property and do not result from
the actions of the applicant and do not apply generally to other land or
buildings in the vicinity.
      (2)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this Code to other lands or structures
in the same zoning district.
      (3)   Granting the variance will not adversely affect the health or
safety of persons residing or working in the vicinity of the proposed
development by material detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to
private property or public improvements in the vicinity.
   (b)   Area Variances.
      (1)   The following factors shall be considered and weighed in the review
and the public hearing of an application for variance.
         A.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without a variance;
         B.   Whether the variance is substantial;
         C.   Whether the character of the area would be adversely affected or
whether adjoining properties would suffer an adverse impact as a result of the
variance;
         D.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., utilities and refuse collection);
         E.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction;
         F.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance; and
         G.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
      (2)   No single factor shall be considered a determinative factor, and
the factors shall be weighed and balanced in determining whether a variance is
warranted. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof that the criteria for a
variance have been met and that application of the zoning requirement to the
applicant's property would be inequitable.
   (c)   Appeal of Administrative Decisions.
      (1)   Certificate appeal. Any application for a certificate of zoning
clearance which has been denied, and any interpretation by the Development
Services Director with respect to an order issued pursuant to this Code, shall
be subject to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board may uphold,
modify or deny the action of the Development Services Director which is taken
on appeal. Appeals are intended to address Code interpretation and are not
intended to be used in lieu of variances.
      (2)   Administrative appeal. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any
person aggrieved or by any officer of the Municipality affected by any decision
of the Development Services Director.
      (3)   Notice of appeal. Appeals shall be taken within ten days after the
decision by filing a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds, with the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the
record upon which the action was taken.
   (d)   Variances by Ordinance of Council. When a variance from the provisions
of this Code is not permitted by the rules herein, Council may consider a
variance from such provisions and may, by passage of an ordinance, vary such
provisions as Council may deem appropriate in a particular situation. Fees
shall be charged to the applicant according to the current fee schedule.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)

1272.11   CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (a)   A conditional use permit will be issued for all uses identified as
conditional uses in this Code when they comply with the regulations of the
district in which they are located and also with the provisions of
Chapter 1286, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission and also with
the criteria listed below:
      (1)   Whether the proposed conditional use is a listed conditional use in

which the property is located.
      (2)   Whether the development standards of the zoning district in which
the property is located are being complied with.

   (b)   All uses not specifically noted as permitted or conditional uses in
this Code shall be referred by the Development Services Director to the
Planning and Zoning Commission to determine if they are permitted, conditional,

approach in approving or conditionally approving unmentioned uses. With regards
to unmentioned uses, a potential applicant is encouraged to seek legislation
wherein a previously unmentioned use becomes a use identified as a conditional
use in this Code prior to filing his application. Unmentioned uses may be
allowed in districts when they are necessary to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the Municipality as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission
per the application of the standards noted in

Services Director is unable to reinspect the property on the compliance date
set forth in such notice, then the person served with the notice may serve upon

1276.08   PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   (a)   All base Residential District regulations shall apply to these planned
districts with the exception of those specifically discussed below.
      (1)   Permitted planned uses. All uses that are permitted by right or as
conditional uses in the base Residential District shall be permitted in the
Residential Planned District, based on the review and approval of the
development plan, when actual development or occupancy of existing planned
development occurs.
      (2)   Density allowances. The density of the base Residential District
may be increased in the Residential Planned District to those amounts indicated
on the planned residential charts. Density per acre is per gross land area. Lot
density is net, excluding streets and rights-of-way.
      (3)   Specific requirements. Yard, lot width, coverage, lot size, height
and parking requirements are in the planned residential charts.
   (b)   Mandatory Requirements in Residential Districts. All of the following
requirements shall be complied with:
      (1)   Open space. There shall be reserved, within the tract to be
developed on a planned basis, a minimum land area of up to twenty percent of
the entire tract (excluding streets), for use as common open space. Twenty
percent open space is a firm goal; however, the total open space may be as low
as fifteen percent, subject to the site constraints and approval of the
Planning and Zoning Commission. No more than forty percent of this open space
shall be water surface and not more than forty percent of the open space shall
have a slope of fifteen percent or greater, except as otherwise provided in
subsection (c) hereof. This common open space shall not consist of isolated,
linear strips or fragmented pieces of land, unless such pieces join to form a
useful amenity such as a walking trail or bike path. Included in this common
open space may be such uses as pedestrian walkways, parkland, open areas,
swimming pools, clubhouses, tennis courts and other lands of essentially open
character, exclusive of off-street parking areas. All land shown on the final
development plan, as specified in this chapter, as common open space, shall be
preserved perpetually for use as common open space under one of the following
options:
         A.   It may be conveyed to the Municipality, which may agree to
maintain the common open spaces and any building, structures or improvements
that have been placed on it. The Municipality reserves the right to accept,
modify or reject such conveyances.
         B.   It may be conveyed to trustees, provided there is an indenture
establishing a neighborhood association or similar organization for the
maintenance of the planned development. The common open space must be conveyed
to the trustees, subject to covenants to be approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission restricting the common open space to uses specified on the final
development plan and providing for the maintenance of the common open space in
a manner that assures its continuing use for its intended purpose. A copy of
the association's by-laws, together with proof of incorporation with the Ohio
Secretary of State, shall be furnished. Such by-laws shall provide that the
association shall maintain an escrow account, funded by an initial deposit upon
purchase of a lot/home equal to one year's dues, in order to meet its
obligations for the common area features, should the association cease to
exist. In order to have a manageable association, no such association shall
usually contain more than 350 homes. The final size shall be determined by the
Director of Planning and Zoning. Each such association shall be required to
have a professional management company run the day-to-day operations of the
association, with the association's Board of Trustees and officers to guide
such management.
         C.   It may be retained by the owner or developer of the site so long
as the owner or developer is actively engaged in doing business on the site. If
the project is sold out or if no single owner controls less than twenty-five
percent of the site, then the options set forth in paragraphs (1)(A) or (1)(B)
hereof must be taken. No common open space shall be put to any use not
specified in the final development plan unless the final development plan has
been amended to permit such use. However, no authorized change of use may be
considered as a waiver of any of the covenants limiting uses of common open
space areas, and all rights to enforce these covenants against any permitted
use are expressly reserved to the Municipality.
      (2)   Perimeter treatment. The exterior boundary lines of the planned
district shall be buffered with landscaping in such a manner as the Planning
and Zoning Commission deems appropriate to screen it from the adjacent uses and
to ensure compatibility. Where adjacent uses are equal or similar, the
Commission may waive pertinent buffering and/or landscaping.
      (3)   Preservation of natural features. Where significant natural
features, such as trees, streams, ponds, wildlife habitat or other unique
landscape features, are present on the site, they should be preserved wherever
possible. These areas may fulfill the open space requirements where specified
criteria are met. Hills, escarpments and other inaccessible features may be
included as open space upon the recommendation of the Commission.
      (4)   Preservation of historic structures. Where significant historic
structures, such as bridges, stone walls, buildings, burial grounds or
archeologically significant sites are present on the site, they should be
preserved wherever possible. If a dispute arises, verification of historic or
archeological significance shall be determined by an appropriate expert
selected by the Development Services Director. The applicant shall pay the fee
for such expert. These areas may fulfill the open space requirements where
specified criteria set by the Commission are met.
   (c)   Flexible Requirements in Residential Districts. Two or more of the
following requirements shall be complied with:
      (1)   Public open space. The provision of required open space for general
public use shall be designated, provided it is active recreation space or
passive recreation space equipped with the appropriate picnic tables, benches
and other outdoor furniture. This public open space must also provide easy
access and circulation for public use.
      (2)   Bikeways. The provision of linear bikeways along waterways or
through wooded areas shall be designated to allow access to the public. These
passageways shall be appropriately paved, landscaped and marked. Bikeways shall
be paved and the width shall be at least eight feet unless site constraints
require a narrower width.
      (3)   Community center. A community center building shall be provided for
use by the residents of the development and/or the general public. It shall
include meeting space and indoor recreational space and may include day care
facilities.
      (4)   Community swimming pool. A community swimming pool shall be
provided for use by the residents of the development and/or the general public.
It shall include a bathhouse.
      (5)   Innovative open space. An area devoted to active or passive
recreation of the intensity and scope of the requirements set forth in
subsections (1) through (4) hereof may be proposed as a flexible requirement
and may be approved as such by the Planning and Zoning Commission.

1282.02    Development standards.
1282.03    Plan contents and requirements.
1282.04    Review basis.
1282.05   Procedures for approval.
1282.01   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of the Planned Development District (PD) is to permit the
greatest possible flexibility in order to stimulate creativity and to allow for
a mixture of a wide variety of land use types within one planned district in
order to:
      (1)   Respect the unique characteristics of the site and surrounding
uses.
      (2)   Encourage imaginative arrangements of land use types and recognize
the need to mitigate the impacts of incompatible land uses.
      (3)   Allow a development pattern which preserves and utilizes the
natural topography, geologic features, vegetation and drainage.
      (4)   Encourage provision of site amenities to serve the immediate
development and surrounding community.
      (5)   Allow the potential for a self-sufficient development area, thus
reducing the requirement for non-essential vehicular trips.
   (b)   The intent of this chapter is to allow the applicant to lessen the
development standards in some areas in exchange for an increase in development
standards in another. The process for achieving the stated purposes and intent
is to require the submission and approval of a preliminary plan for the total
proposed development and the submission and approval of a final development
plan for all or any part of the area defined in the preliminary plan prior to
obtaining a zoning certificate as part of the approval for the construction of
any portion of the area. As part of the preliminary plan, the applicant must
prepare and submit a development standards text that identifies any development
standard that is less restrictive than the standards set forth in this chapter
or other referenced chapters. As part of the development standards text, the
applicant must justify the modifications of these standards based on the fact
that the proposed development goes beyond minimum requirements in other areas
that will result in a superior development than if the standards set forth in
this chapter had been followed. As part of the final development plan, the
applicant must verify that the previously approved development standards text
is being used or submit as part of the final development plan a modified
development standards text for approval by Planning and Zoning Commission.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1282.02   DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   The following development standards shall be considered as minimal
standards within the Planned Development District. These standards shall serve
as base standards to be included and modified if desired as part of the
development standards text and preliminary plan and further refined as part of
the final development plan.
      (1)   Lot requirements. If a bufferyard is required and the minimum
setback is less than the appropriate bufferyard width, then the setback shall
be equal to the bufferyard width. If a bufferyard is required and the minimum
setback is greater than the appropriate bufferyard width, then the setback
shall be equal to the required setback.
         A.   Minimum lot width. None, except that all lots must abut a public
street and have adequate width to meet all building and pavement setbacks,
parking, circulation, open space and landscaping requirements.
         B.   Minimum yard requirements. None, except as specified in the
development standards text, but with sufficient setback area to accommodate
landscape buffer, screening and planting requirements, in the Zoning Code.
         C.   Maximum lot coverage. Maximum lot coverage or impervious surface
area shall be eighty percent with a total building coverage of thirty percent
unless otherwise modified by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (2)   Building requirements. Maximum building height of forty feet or as
established by Planning and Zoning Commission as part of the development plan.
      (3)   Site development requirements.
         A.   Outdoor storage is prohibited. Merchandise may be displayed on
the sidewalk adjacent to the principal building provided a minimum of a five
foot strip is left unobstructed for pedestrian traffic.
         B.   All vending machines and display racks, except for telephone
booths and newspaper racks, shall be located inside the building.
         C.   Trash and litter shall be controlled, and stored in container
systems which are located and enclosed in a manner to screen them from view on
all sides.
         D.   Provision for storm drainage shall be adequate to protect the
public and owners of surrounding land and meet the City's requirements for
storm water management.
         E.   All service and delivery shall be at the rear of the building;
provided, however, where site layout and design would be enhanced, provisions
may be made for service and delivery at the side of the building.
   (b)   Parking, loading, access and circulation requirements for uses
permitted in this district are set forth in
Chapter 1290.
   (c)   Landscaping and screening requirements for uses permitted in this
district are set forth in the Zoning Code.
   (d)   Sign requirements for uses permitted in this district are set forth in
Chapter 1292.
   (e)   Lighting requirements for uses permitted in this district are set
forth in the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1282.03   PLAN CONTENTS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   As part of the request for rezoning to a Planned Development District,
a preliminary plan must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission
along with the text of all applicable development standards. The applicant
shall submit the number of application copies deemed appropriate by the Zoning
Officer. This may include an electronic filing in a format compatible with
Pickerington technology requirements. City Council must approve the zoning
change, preliminary plan and development standards text. A zoning certificate
will not be issued for any site or sites until a final development plan is
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and found in conformance with
the adopted preliminary plan and development standards text.
   The applicant may in the applicant's sole discretion, meet with the Planning
and Zoning Commission for an informal review prior to submitting an application
for a Planned Development District zoning amendment. The informal review is
intended to outline the basic scope, character and nature of a proposed
project. The review is to provide input in the formative stages of design. No
discussions, opinions, or suggestions provided in the informal review shall
bind the applicant, or the City, or be relied upon by the applicant to indicate
subsequent approval or disapproval by the City.
      (1)   Preliminary plan. The preliminary plan is a conceptual plan
generally describing the proposed uses for the site to be rezoned and their
relationship with surrounding properties and uses. The preliminary plan
constitutes the rezoning of the property. The preliminary plan should contain
the following elements:
         A.   A topographic map of the site and adjacent property showing
existing natural features including wooded areas and major trees. A description
of how the proposed development was planned to utilize the existing site,
identifying charges to the existing site grading and noting major trees that
will be removed as part of the proposed development.
         B.   A schematic plan showing the general development of the tract,
location of existing and proposed structures, parking lot layout and other
development features including the location of all out parcels.
         C.   An engineering feasibility statement in sufficient detail to
indicate how the proposed development will be serviced with water, sanitary
sewer and storm drainage facilities.

Commission necessary to determine that the proposed development meets the
intent and purposes of the Planned Development District.
      (2)   Development standards text. A development standards text shall be
submitted as part of the preliminary plan and shall, through a narrative and
graphics, as necessary, detail the development standards to be applied to the
development concept described in the preliminary plan. The development
standards text should clearly identify any standard that is less than the
standards established by this chapter. These modifications shall be justified
by fully stating what adjustments, amenities or other compensations are
provided as part of the preliminary plan to offset the use of reduced standards
and by demonstrating how the modified standards will result in the best
possible development for the site. Unless specifically modified by the
development standards text, the standards established by this chapter shall
apply to the proposed development.
   (b)   Final Development Plan. Following approval of the preliminary plan,
and prior to issuance of a zoning certificate, a final development plan shall
be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission in a format deemed

gentle rolling topography to minimize erosion by wind or rain and substantially
conform with the contour of the surrounding area.
      (4)   Enclosure. Whenever the floor of a quarry is five feet or more
below the grade of adjacent land, the property containing the quarry shall be
completely enclosed by a barrier consisting of either a mound of earth not less
than six feet high located at least twenty-five feet from any street right-of-
way and planted with a double row of approved landscape materials or enclosed
with a chain-link fence, or of its equivalent in strength and protective
character to a height of six feet along the property line. Such barriers may be
excluded where deemed unnecessary by the Municipal Engineer because of the
presence of a lake, stream or other existing natural barrier.
      (5)   Right-of-way setback. An excavation shall be located 100 feet or
more and backfilled to 150 feet from a street right-of-way line. Quarrying
operations shall be located fifty feet or more from a street right-of-way line.
With approval by the Municipal Engineer, such excavation or quarrying may be
permitted within these limits to the point of reducing the ground elevation to
the established street grade.

intervals of five feet or less.
         B.   Existing proposed drainage of the area.
         C.   Details regarding revegetation of the site during and at the
conclusion of the operation.
      (2)   Requirements of rehabilitation plan. The following requirements
shall be met in the rehabilitation plan:
         A.   The banks of all extraction, when not backfilled, shall be sloped
at a grade of not less than two feet horizontal to one foot vertical. This
slope shall be maintained twenty feet beyond the water line if such exists.
         B.   Spoil banks shall be graded to a level suiting the existing
terrain.
         C.   All banks and extracted areas shall be surfaced with at least six
inches of suitable soil, except exposed rock surfaces, and shall be planted or
seeded with trees, shrubs, legumes or grasses and maintained until the soil is
stabilized and approved by the Municipal Engineer.
         D.   When any extraction has been completed, such area shall either be
left as a permanent spring-fed lake or the floor thereof shall be leveled in
such a manner as to prevent the collection and stagnation of water and to
provide proper drainage without excessive soil erosion, and shall otherwise
comply with these requirements.
         E.   All equipment and structures shall be removed within three months
of the completion of the extraction of materials.

CHAPTER 1288
Nonconforming Uses
1288.01   Continuation, expansion, elimination and reconstruction.
1288.02   Nonconforming lots of record.
1288.03   Nonconforming structures.
1288.04   Nonconforming uses.
1288.05   Repairs and maintenance.
1288.01   CONTINUATION, EXPANSION, ELIMINATION AND RECONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Intent. Within the City of Pickerington there exist:
      (1)   Lots;
      (2)   Structures;
      (3)   Uses of land and structures; and
      (4)   Development Standards of uses;
which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was passed or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance. It is the intent of this section to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, with the greatest sensitivity to landowner
rights. It is further the intent of this section to require that Code sections
within this chapter be liberally construed in favor of the landowner.
   (b)   Extension of Nonconforming Uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
have the authority to grant an extension of a building or the expansion of the
use of a lot devoted to a nonconforming use where such extension is necessary
and incidental to the existing use of such building or lot. However, the floor
areas or lot areas of such extensions shall not exceed, in all, 100 percent of
the area of the existing building or lot devoted to a nonconforming use. The
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may be appealed to City Council.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1288.02   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (a)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even
though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that
are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall
be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance, and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning
Ordinance. The Planning and Zoning Commission may permit the development of two
or more contiguous, non-conforming lots if it is determined that the proposal
is consistent with the development pattern in the site area, will not have an
adverse effect on adjacent properties and is consistent with City plans or
objectives for the area.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1288.03   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption of this
Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto, that could not be built under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards, its location on the lot or other requirements concerning the
structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of
its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1288.04   NONCONFORMING USES.
   The nonconforming use of a lot and/or a structure may be continued, expanded
or changed subject to the following:
   (a)   Change of a nonconforming use shall be allowed to a permitted use of
the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located.
   (b)   On approval of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, a
nonconforming use may be changed to a use closer in character with the zoning
district in which the nonconforming use is located.
   (c)   On approval of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, a
nonconforming use may be expanded within an existing structure manifestly
arranged or developed for such use.
   (d)   No nonconforming use may be reestablished where such nonconforming use
has been discontinued for a period of at least one year. The nonconforming use
of any structure damaged by fire, explosion, flood, riot or act of God may be
continued and used as before any such calamity, provided the building or
structure has not been destroyed to an extent of more than one-half of its fair
value, and provided such reconstruction is started within twelve months of such
calamity and is continued in a reasonable manner until completed.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1288.05   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months
on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, heating, air conditioning or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten
percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or
nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the
cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
   (b)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)

1290.01   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Compliance Required. No building or structure or use of land shall be
erected, substantially altered or have its use changed unless permanently
maintained off-street parking spaces are provided in accordance with the
provisions of this Code and the nonresidential design standards of this Code.
   (b)   Prospective Application. The requirements of this section shall not
apply to any existing building or structure or use except as required below.
   (c)   Minor Changes. Whenever a building or structure is changed or enlarged
in floor area, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise, to
create a need for an increase of more than ten percent (but less than fifty
percent) in the number of existing parking spaces, additional parking spaces
shall be provided consistent with this Code on the basis of that enlargement or
change only.
   (d)   Major Changes. Whenever a building is enlarged to the extent of more
than fifty percent in floor area, number of housing units, seating capacity or
otherwise, such building or structure shall then and thereafter comply with the
full parking requirements set forth herein. However, a change in use that
creates a need for an increase of less than five off-street parking spaces will
require only those additional parking facilities required by subsection (c)
hereof.
   (e)   Change of Use. Whenever a building undergoes a change of use requiring
the addition of more than ten parking spaces, the new use shall comply with
this Code in full.
   (f)   Extension of Nonconforming Use. Additional parking requirements, if
any, will be determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals at such time as the
Board approves an extension under Section
1288.01.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1290.02   LOCATION OF PARKING.
   (a)   On-Site Parking. Off-street parking spaces required by this section
shall be provided on the same lot as the principal use the spaces are provided
to serve, except for those cases identified below.
   (b)   Satellite Parking.
      (1)   A.   If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this
section cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use
associated with these parking spaces is located in the C-2 District, then a
satellite parking area may be used. However, the use and the parking must both
be in the C-2 District.
         B.   Where parking is being provided collectively, spaces may be
provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this
section. These off-site parking spaces are referred to in this section as
"satellite" parking spaces.
      (2)   All such satellite parking spaces must be located within 500 feet
of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with
such parking or within 500 feet of the lot on which the use associated with
such parking is located, if the use is not housed within a principal building.
      (3)   Those wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section
must present a satisfactory written agreement assuming the retention of the
spaces, properly drawn and executed by the parties involved, and approved as to
form by the Law Director. Such persons must also sign an acknowledgment that
the continuing validity of their permit depends upon their continuing ability
to provide the requisite number of parking spaces.
   (c)   Required Setbacks.
      (1)   Parking shall be permitted in forty percent of the required front
yard setback. Residents with private drives leading to an approved garage may
park operable automobiles in the required front yard setback for up to one
week. Usual and customary parking, such as the parking of operable privately-
owned vehicles in residential private drives, is expressly permitted. Storage
of vehicles in the required front yard is prohibited.
      (2)   Parking shall be permitted in forty percent of the required side
yard setbacks when the adjacent zoning is commercial or industrial.
      (3)   There are no restrictions on maneuvering in the rear yard setback
except that sufficient space for screening, which may be required, must be
reserved.
      (4)   Semitractor parking in required yard areas is also regulated by
Chapter 452 of these Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1290.03   COMPUTATION OF REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   Fractional Spaces. When units of measurement determining the number of
required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction shall require one additional parking space.
   (b)   Joint Use. Two or more nonresidential uses may jointly provide and use
off-street parking spaces when their respective hours of operation do not
normally overlap, provided that a written agreement approved by the Development
Services Director shall be filed with the application for a zoning certificate.
Uses that do not have the same hours of operation may designate up to fifty
percent of their respectively required number of off-street parking spaces as
shared spaces. Buildings or uses not normally open, used or operated during the
principal operating hours of theaters, churches or school auditoriums include
banks and financial institutions, business and professional offices and retail
and personal service establishments.
   (c)   Mixed Occupancies and Uses Not Specified. In the case of mixed uses,
the total requirement for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the
requirements for the various uses computed separately. In the case of a use not
specifically mentioned, the requirements for off-street parking facilities
shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other
use, except as specified for joint use.
   (d)   Collective Provision of Facilities. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent collective provision of off-street parking facilities for
two or more buildings or uses, provided the total of such off-street parking
spaces supplied collectively is not less than the sum of the requirements for
the various uses computed separately, and provided that the requirements set
forth for satellite parking spaces shall apply to each establishment
participating in the collective provision of off-street parking spaces.
   (e)   Multiple Uses in a Single Establishment. A single establishment in one
building or structure may contain both public and nonpublic spaces. The off-
street parking required for spaces such as kitchens, mechanical rooms, offices
and service areas may be separately computed and added to the requirement for
public areas to determine the total parking requirement.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1290.04   REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION.
   All applicants for a zoning certificate, conditional use permit or planned
district approval shall include with their application a plan drawn to scale

   (a)   All required off-street parking areas shall be solely for the parking,
loading and unloading of operable motor vehicles and are not to be used to
store inoperative motor vehicles or for any motor vehicle repair work or
service of any kind, except for emergency repairs.
   (b)   The parking of a disabled vehicle for a period of more than seven days
shall be prohibited, unless such vehicle is stored in an enclosed garage,
fence, or other accessory building. (See Section
1080.02 of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code.)

1292.01   INTENT; SCOPE; USE TYPES; UNLISTED SIGNS.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to encourage the proper development
and use of planned graphic signage systems and to regulate signs and signage
systems. In addition to protection from distractions and obstructions that may
contribute to traffic and pedestrian accidents, it is the contention of this
chapter that signs are as much subject to control as noise, odor, debris and
like characteristics of a use and that if they are not controlled and
regulated, they may become a nuisance factor to adjacent properties or the
community in general. To protect the general health, safety and welfare of the
community, and to protect and encourage a more attractive, businesslike
appearance of the community, all signs and signage systems are subject to this
chapter.
   (b)   This chapter recognizes two underlying sign uses, namely on-premises
and off-premises signs, and regulates each such use in accordance with
community standards and the appropriate visual effect of signage in each zoning
district. On-premises signs are intended primarily for identification of a land
use on the same premises. In some zoning districts, on-premises signs may
advertise as well. Off-premises signs advertise, promote or inform regarding
products or services available primarily at locations other than the site of
the off-premises sign. Off-premises signs include billboards and other signs
that fit the above description. Co-op signs are a combination of on-premises
and off-premises uses. Typically furnished by national or regional companies,
co-op signs advertise a product on part of the face of the sign and the local
business on the remainder of the sign.
   (c)   Regulation of signs is based on the concept of "visual performance."
As used in this section, "visual performance" means that the way a sign
functions (or will function) in the environment affects the regulations that
will be applied to it. For example, a sign mounted on a pole but adjacent to a
building wall could be treated as a wall sign because it functions as such.
   (d)   Signs for uses not specifically listed in this chapter, or for which
the Planning and Zoning Department requires a Code interpretation, shall be
brought before the Planning and Zoning Commission. These signs shall conform to
the appropriate regulation or Code interpretation within the purpose and intent
of this chapter. The Planning and Zoning Department shall keep a separate
record of such actions for use in updating this Code.
   (e)   This chapter encourages comprehensive signage plans for a site under
the control of a single owner, by permitting such plans to be used in lieu of
specific regulations.
   (f)   Illuminated, neon and other artificially illuminated window signs
existing prior to the adoption of this section, as amended, are hereby declared
to be subject to the provisions of Section
1292.03.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1292.02    PERMITTED SIGNS FOR WHICH NO CERTIFICATE IS REQUIRED.
   The following signs shall be permitted in the Municipality subject to the
following regulations. No zoning certificate shall be required for any sign
constructed or erected in accordance with this section.
   (a)   Signs displaying the address and name of the occupant of the premises
for a residential structure, not including designations as to employment or
home occupations, and limited in size to one square foot and limited to one
sign per premises.
   (b)   Signs required or authorized for a public purpose by any law, statute
or ordinance, including traffic control devices.
   (c)   Signs in the nature of cornerstones, commemorative tables and
historical signs, limited in size to twelve square feet and not illuminated.
   (d)   Signs clearly in the nature of decorations customarily associated with
any national, local or religious holiday, limited to sixty days in any one year
and to be displayed for not more than sixty consecutive days. Such signs may be
illuminated or animated, provided that safety and visibility hazards are not
created.
   (e)   Political signs or posters concerning candidates for election, to be
removed not later than five days after such election. Such signs shall not
exceed six square feet in area, shall not be illuminated, shall not create a
safety or visibility hazard and shall not be located over a public right-of-
way. Ballot issue signs may be permitted within the right-of-way only when
specifically permitted by the City Manager or designee. No sign governed by
this section shall be placed on any property without prior approval of the
landowner.
   (f)   Signs that indicate the sale, rental or lease of a particular
structure or land area, to be limited in size to six square feet, with one sign
allowed per street front. Such signs shall not be located in a public right-of-
way, nor shall they be used in lieu of permanent signs.
   (g)   Interior signs of a business use, incorporated into a window display,
as permitted in Section
1292.03(a)(4), and limited to nine square feet or less. Such signs are limited
to one sign per window.
   (h)   On site directional signs indicating points of entry or exit for a
facility or off-street parking area, provided such signs are limited to a
maximum of two square feet in area and three feet in height and do not
interfere with safe vehicular or pedestrian traffic circulation and are not
located within the clear sign distance triangle.
   (i)   Menu boards, provided such signs are oriented solely for the use of
patrons utilizing the drive-thru and are directed toward traffic internal to
the site.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1292.03   PERMITTED SIGNS FOR WHICH A CERTIFICATE IS REQUIRED.
   All signs not already specifically excluded shall require a zoning
certificate. Signs are classified into six types, namely wall, projected,
ground, roof, interior window signs and temporary signs; and three uses, namely
on-premises, off-premises and co-op signs.
   (a)   Types of Signs.
      (1)   Wall signs. A wall sign may be erected on a building wall that
faces a street, parking lot or service drive, and such signs may not extend
beyond any building setback lines. Letters, graphics and/or numerals mounted on
a building wall shall be considered as wall signs. A wall sign shall be
attached parallel to the building face and shall extend outward perpendicular
from the building face a maximum of fourteen inches, except that a sign may be
attached to a canopy, marquee or roof that projects beyond the building,
provided that no part of such sign extends beyond such roof, canopy or marquee.
      (2)   Projected signs.
         A.   A projected sign, including the necessary mounting structure,
shall project not more than four feet outward from the wall of the structure,
shall not exceed ten square feet in size, shall not use a guy-wire or angle-
iron type of support structure, unless such structure is erected in the plane
of the sign, and shall not extend beyond any dimension of the wall to which it
is attached. Projected signs shall be perpendicular to the wall to which they
are attached, except at street corners where the sign may project at forty-five
degree angle, and may be noninternally lighted. Internal lighting of any type
shall not be used.
         B.   No projected sign shall be located less than nine feet above the
sidewalk or ground level. No part of a projected sign shall be closer than six
feet from the edge of the pavement or curb, whichever is appropriate. Such
signs shall be of sturdy construction and shall be erected in such a manner as
to protect persons who may pass underneath from possible injury. Sign users who
place projected signs over the public right-of-way shall indemnify, protect and
hold harmless the City from any claim, loss or damage arising in connection
with the occupation of the public right-of-way with the sign. One projected
sign is permitted per building, per street frontage. "Credit card" type small
projected signs are regulated by this section. Except as permitted in paragraph
(a)(2)C. hereof, projected signs are permitted only in the C-2 Central
Business/Mixed Use District. Projected signs shall not be co-op signs.
         C.   One projected sign that displays the name and/or address of the
building occupant, meets all of the criteria set forth above and does not
exceed one and one-half square feet in size, may be displayed by any use in any
zoning district.
      (3)   Ground signs. One ground sign per building per street frontage may
be erected where permitted, provided the location, size, height and other
characteristics of the sign meet the requirements of this chapter. "Ground
sign" includes all on-premises, free-standing signs, regardless of type or
nomenclature.
         A.   Ground signs shall have a brick or stone base with columns
extending a minimum seventy-five percent up each side of the sign.
         B.   Ground signs shall be limited to two colors that advertise more
than one tenant (background and lettering shall have different colors) and have
a matte finish. For purposes of this section, black or white may be used for
lettering and shall not count toward the two permissible colors.
         C.   Non-permanent lettering (changeable copy) shall be limited to
thirty percent of the sign area.
      (4)   Window signs.
         A.   Window signs shall include temporary and permanent signs,
posters, symbols and numerals and/or letters painted directly on, attached
directly to and/or located in, near or around windows and oriented to the
outside such that they are readable from a public right-of-way or designated
driveway of a commercial center. For purposes of this section a window is
defined as the glass area enclosed within a frame.
         B.   No flashing lights or raceways of any kind or type shall be
permitted. Permanent window signs shall be limited to one such sign per window
and shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the window area, and in no case
shall such a sign exceed nine square feet. All window signs shall be limited to
ground or first floor windows only. An exception is allowed in the C2 District
for a business that does not occupy first-floor space. All other sections of
this chapter shall apply to the sign.
         C.   Businesses shall arrange all window signs so as to permit a
clear, unrestricted line of sight from the street to the inside of the
business.
         D.   No flashing or animated signs shall be permitted and neon signs
shall be limited to identify if a business is open or closed (no advertising).
      (5)   Roof signs. Roof signs are prohibited in all districts, except as
permitted previously and now existing as nonconforming users. A roof sign is
any sign erected upon the roof of a building or any portion of a sign that is
above the roof of the building. The roof line shall be defined as the uppermost
line of the roof of the building or, in the case of an extended building
facade, the uppermost height of the facade.
      (6)   Temporary signs.
         A.   Community activity signage. Such activity that is open to the
general public and sponsored by a public, private nonprofit or religious
organization [that is educational, cultural, or recreational in function] is
permitted signage upon compliance of the following requirements: The signage
shall be limited to fourteen days per event, thirty-two square feet and two
signs per site. The signage shall not have changeable copy (letters). The
subject community activity shall own property in the City or Violet Township to
advertise. Such signage may be located off premises within a public right-of-
way or on public property with the express written consent of the City Manager
or designee. The denial of a zoning certificate for community activity signage
may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         B.   Special promotions/grand openings/temporary signs. Signs (banners
and pennants) identifying, promoting or advertising grand openings, special
sales and/or special occasions shall be erected for a maximum of fifteen
calendar days. Such signs are permitted in all Commercial, Office and
Industrial Districts and in the C2 Central Business/Mixed Use District. The
size of the signs shall be limited to thirty-two square feet. The total time
period in which such signs shall be utilized on any lot or site or by any one
user is ninety days in one calendar year (the ninety day time period can be
divided into six fifteen day increments with an approved zoning certificate).
All signs shall be located on a building. At no time are banners or pennants
permitted over the right-of-way.
         C.   Development signs. Signs indicating and promoting the development
of land are permitted, at the discretion of the Development Services Director.
The signs shall be limited to thirty-two square feet, located on the subject
property (one sign per lot) outside the site triangle and five feet from
property line/right-of-way. An approved zoning certificate is effective for a
maximum period of twelve months and may be renewed by the Development Services
Director if subject development is not completed. Such signs may be located in
the public right-of-way, or on public property, upon the express written
consent of the City Manager or designee.
   (b)   Sign Uses.
      (1)   Permanent residential subdivision identification signage.
"Permanent residential subdivision identification signage" means those signage
features specifically relating to the denotation of a major entrance or
entrances to a residential subdivision. Such identification shall be limited to
wall-mounted signs or graphics only. For example, placement of a brick wall,
railroad ties or entrance columns on each side of a street, or on a similar
architectural or landscaping entrance feature, may be used. Pole-type signage
is hereby prohibited. Entrance signs and features shall be in compliance with
Section
1258.27 (Perimeter Mounding and Fencing; Trees).
      (2)   Joint identification signs. "Joint identification signs," subject
to the following conditions, shall be permitted for two or more combined,
permitted uses on the same lot, to include the identification of shopping
centers or other building group complexes. A joint identification shall be
limited to one wall or ground sign and shall be allowed in addition to other
permitted signs and total aggregate sign area. One square foot of sign area is
permitted for each two linear feet of street frontage, provided that the total
sign area shall not exceed fifty square feet. A second joint identification
sign may be permitted if the site fronts two streets, provided the frontage is
not less than 250 feet on either street. However, there shall not be more than
one ground sign per street frontage, under any circumstances.
      (3)   Off-premises signs. In addition to those off-premises signs that
legally existed and that are considered to be a nonconforming use, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may permit off-premises signs to be located in the C4
Highway Commercial and the M General Industrial Zoning Districts. The
Commission is hereby authorized to establish additional rules for the
installation, location and placement of off-premises signs. The following are
the minimum criteria for the regulation of off-premises signs and are effective
without additional action by the Commission:
         A.   No off-premises sign shall be closer than 1,200 feet to any other
off-premises sign in any direction and along either side of any road, street or
highway.
         B.   Each off-premises sign permitted for installation shall be
matched with the removal of another off-premises sign of approximately the same
size located within the Municipality and removed for the specific purpose of
complying.
         C.   No off-premises sign shall be repaired if the repair cost exceeds
fifty percent of the current depreciated value of the sign, without the sign
being brought into total compliance with the rules and regulations set by this
Code and by the Planning and Zoning Commission. No off-premises sign structure
shall be replaced without the sign being brought into compliance.
         D.   No off-premises sign shall exceed twenty-five feet in height to
the top of the structure or sign face, whichever is higher. No sign face shall
exceed 250 square feet. All structures shall be made of metal and shall be of
the single-pole variety. Structures made of ferrous metals shall be totally
maintained and painted at least once every three years.
         E.   No off-premises sign shall be used in lieu of an on-premises
sign. Advertising messages shall advertise or promote products or inform of
services which are available principally at locations other than at the site of
the sign.
         F.   Sign faces shall be kept in good repair, and if poster panels are
used, the face of the structure shall be scraped to metal at least once every
twelve months. If painted, the paint shall be renewed at least once every
twenty-four months. The area around the base of the sign shall be kept free
from debris and rank growth.
         G.   Off-premises signs located along Federal and State highways shall
not be sited so as to necessitate the cutting or removal of any existing trees
in order to obtain visibility from the highway. In conformity with this
provision, the Planning and Zoning Department shall consider the cutting or
removal of trees prior to a permit application to disqualify an off-premises
site. Subsequent cutting or removal of trees is a violation of this Code.
      (4)   Co-op signs. Co-op signs are permitted in the C1 Neighborhood
Commercial District, subject to the schedule of sign regulations, the number
and size of signs permitted and the following ratio. Messages regarding
products or services that are available principally at other sites shall not
exceed twenty-five percent of the total face area of the sign.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14; Ord. 2023-06. Passed 10-17-23.)
1292.04   PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   (a)   Animated Signs. Flashing lights, blinking lights, laser lights,
animated LED reader board and digital reader boards, except as permitted in
this chapter, are prohibited.
   (b)   Mobile and Portable Signs; Balloons. Mobile signs, portable signs
blow-up/inflatable signs and advertising balloons are prohibited, except for
portable signs within the Olde Downtown Pickerington Village Area as regulated
by Section
1292.08.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1292.05   DESIGN AND LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Sign Construction/Materials.
      (1)   All signs shall be properly constructed to withstand a wind
pressure of thirty pounds per square foot. All signs shall be built in
conformity with the Ohio Building Code. Ground signs require footer inspection
by the Building Department.
      (2)   Sign material. The replacement of an existing sign for a new sign
shall be constructed of the same or nearly the same material. Any material
change shall require comprehensive sign plan approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   (b)   Location in Public Right-of-Way. No sign or any part of any sign shall
be placed in, over or extend into any public right-of-way. Exceptions include
publicly-owned signs, such as traffic control signs or directional signs, and
projected signs, which may be permitted in the C2 District.
   (c)   Illuminated Signs.
      (1)   The level of illumination emitted or reflected from a sign shall
not be of an intensity sufficient to constitute a safety hazard to vehicular
movement on any street from which the sign may be viewed.
      (2)   Illuminated signs shall be constructed and maintained so that the
source of illumination is shielded or otherwise prevented from beaming directly
onto adjacent lots or streets.
   (d)   Safety. All signs shall be properly constructed and maintained to
ensure that no safety hazard is created.
   (e)   Sign Measurement.
      (1)   Sign areas shall include the face of all the display areas of the
sign, including logos, graphics, stripes or combinations of colors and designs
that extend the visual effect of the size of the sign, but shall not include
the bracing, framing and structural supports of the sign, unless such supports
are made part of the message or face of the sign.
      (2)   Where a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces
of the sign shall be included in determining the area of the sign, unless two
display faces, joined back-to-back, are parallel to each other and are not more
than twenty-four inches apart, or form a V-angle of less than forty-five
degrees. For spherical signs, the sphere shall be bisected by an imaginary line
through the center of the sphere and the surface area of the half sphere shall
be counted as the sign face.
      (3)   The area of letters, numbers, emblems, logos, stripes or
combinations thereof; mounted on a building wall or wall extension, shall be
computed by enclosing such a sign with the smallest single continuous perimeter
around the letters, numbers or emblems.
      (4)   For structures and uses having no direct frontage on public roads,
as within shopping centers, frontage shall be based upon the actual frontage of
the business structure, whether or not it is on a common mall or sidewalk.
   (f)   Maximum Number, Height and Area of Signs.
      (1)   In addition to placement of signs, the height, area and number of
permitted signs allowed per use or lot shall be allowed as specifically
regulated in the schedule of regulations in Section
1292.07. The height of the sign shall be measured from the established grade,
which shall be defined as that point where the grade line intersects the
fronting wall of the building. The height of a sign may not be artificially
increased beyond the permitted height by placement of signage on earth mounds
that are created during site development.
      (2)   The replacement of an existing sign for a new sign shall encompass
the same amount of area or less. Any area increase shall require comprehensive
sign plan approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (g)   Colors. No individual sign shall be limited to a number of colors. All
signs shall have a matte finish. Ground signs with more than one tenant shall
meet the requirements of Section
1292.03(a)(3).
   (h)   Comprehensive Sign Plans.
      (1)   In any district, except the AGR District and all Residential
Districts, the owner of the property may submit a comprehensive sign plan which
includes all sign uses for the entire site. If any variance to the Sign Code is
requested, then the property owner must apply for comprehensive sign plan.
      (2)   Prohibited signs shall not be included in the comprehensive sign
plan. Off-premises signs and co-op signs are prohibited in comprehensive sign
plans. After review and approval, the comprehensive plan shall become the sign
regulations for the subject site.
      (3)   All plans shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Department
for completeness and attention to detail. The Planning and Zoning Department
shall submit the plan with their comments to the Planning and Zoning Commission
at the next scheduled meeting. The Planning and Zoning Department's comments
shall be carefully considered by the Commission in its review of the plan. The
Commission may approve, modify or reject a plan.
      (4)   Comprehensive sign plans shall include all signs, permanent and
temporary, which are proposed for use on the site. Exterior and window signs
which are not visible from the public right-of-way shall be included in such
plans for information purposes, but are generally exempt from regulation.
      (5)   A comprehensive sign plan shall not restrict the number of colors
for individual signs. All signs shall have a matte finish. The owner has the
authority to restrict the number of colors per tenant and building. Ground
signs with more than one tenant shall meet the requirements of Section
1292.03(a)(3).
   (i)   Setbacks. All ground signs shall be set back from the right-of-way
line at least five feet and be located outside the site triangle (20 ft. by 20
ft.).
   (j)   Sign Materials. Channel letters shall be required with face, trim and
return uniformity. The channel letter cabinet shall be located behind the wall
and internally illuminated. However, non-channel letter comprehensive sign
plans can be considered in circumstances deemed special by staff and the
Planning and Zoning Commission (office, industrial uses, etc.).
   (k)   High-Rise Signs. Any sign on top of a building that exceeds thirty-
five feet in height is considered a high-rise sign. High-rise signs shall only
be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission when:
      (1)   The product or service to be advertised or identified is the
principal product or service available on the site.
      (2)   The site contains a property line of not less than fifty feet in
length which is contiguous to an interstate highway right-of-way. Contiguity
may be established where a public street or service road is parallel and
contiguous to the interstate highway right-of-way and where the subject site is
contiguous to such street or service road.

abandoned, the right to maintain and use such a sign shall terminate
immediately.
      (3)   Physical removal of a sign may be accomplished pursuant to the
nuisance abatement ordinance of the Municipality.
   (b)   Relocation; Replacement.
      (1)   A nonconforming sign shall not be structurally relocated or

with the following:
         A.   The size and structural shape shall not be changed or altered.
The copy may be changed, provided that the change applies to the original
nonconforming use associated with the sign and that the change is made by the
owner of the sign at the time the sign became nonconforming. The copy shall not
be enlarged. Any subsequent owner or user shall bring the sign into compliance
within thirty days.
         B.   If damage occurs to a sign to the extent of fifty percent of more
of either the structure or the depreciated value of the sign, the sign shall be
brought into compliance. Where damage to the sign is less than fifty percent of
the structure or its depreciated value, the sign shall be repaired within sixty
days.

1294.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and welfare of
the public while not unreasonably interfering with the development of the
competitive wireless telecommunication marketplace through the establishment of
requirements for the installation of wireless communication facilities.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1294.02   OBJECTIVES.
   The following are the City's objectives:
   (a)   To comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including any
follow-on rules and/or rule interpretation by the appropriate State and Federal
agencies and the courts.
   (b)   To work pro-actively with the various wireless telecommunications
service providers to ensure rapid and reliable deployment of their services and
technologies while minimizing the negative impacts on the City.
   (c)   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas.
   (d)   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas.
   (e)   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community.
   (f)   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a
primary option rather than construction of additional single use towers.
   (g)   Encourage the owners and operators of wireless towers and antennas to
locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal.
   (h)   Encourage owners and operators of wireless communications facilities
and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse impact of
the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening,
and innovative camouflaging techniques to be sure that, to the greatest extent
feasible, wireless towers and antennas and ancillary facilities are compatible
with surrounding land users.
   (i)   Consider the public health and safety of wireless communications
facilities.
   (j)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties caused by wireless
communications facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully
designed, constructed, modified, maintained and removed.
   (k)   To make available appropriate City owned property and structures for
wireless communications facilities.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)

the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number
include the plural number. All capitalized terms used in the definition of any
other term shall have their meaning as otherwise defined in this section. The
words "shall" and "will" are mandatory and "may" is permissive. Words not
defined shall be given their common and ordinary meaning.
   (a)   "Antenna" means any exterior apparatus used for transmitting and
receiving, mounted on a tower, alternative tower structure, building or

waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies (excluding radar
signals), wireless telecommunications signals or other communication signals.
   (b)   "Antenna tower" means any structure that is designed and constructed
primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone,
radio and similar communication purposes. The term includes radio and
television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers,
cellular telephone towers, antenna tower alternative structures, and the like.
The term also includes the structure and any support thereto.
   (c)   "Antenna tower alternative structure" means man made trees, clock
towers, bell steeples, and similar alternative-design mounting structures that
substantially camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers such
that one would not identify the structure as an antenna tower.
   (d)   "Antenna tower height" means, when referring to a tower or other
structure within the provisions of this chapter, the distance measured from the
average grade plane of the antenna tower base to the highest point on the tower
or other structure, including any antenna and additional height required for
co-location. Lightning rods up to six feet in length and 1.25 inches in
diameter may extend above the maximum height measured. When roof-mounted,
antenna tower height shall be measured from the average grade plane of the
building to the highest point on the tower or other structure, including any
antenna and additional height required for co-location.
   (e)   "Average grade plane" means a reference plane representing the average
of finished ground level adjoining the structure or building at all exterior
surfaces.
   (f)   "Backhaul network" means the lines that connect a provider's towers/
cell sites to one or more cellular telephone switching offices, and/or long
distance providers, or the public switched telephone network.
   (g)   "Co-location" means the use of wireless communications facilities by
more than one wireless communications provider.
   (h)   "Conditional use" means a use, although often desirable, which will
more intensely affect the surrounding area in which such facility is located
than is permitted in such zoning district. A conditional use may be permitted
through a permit by the Planning and Zoning Commission after a public hearing.
   (i)   "Engineer" means a registered professional engineer licensed in the
State of Ohio to provide any information of an engineering nature, whether
civil, electrical or mechanical.
   (j)   "FAA" means the Federal Aviation Administration.

(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1294.09   DESIGN STANDARDS.
   For the protection of the public health, welfare and safety, all principally
and conditionally permitted wireless communications facilities shall meet or
exceed the following standards.
   (a)   Co-Location. As a condition of issuing a permit to construct and
operate a tower in the City, the owner/operator of the tower is required to
allow co-location until said tower has reached full antenna capacity, but in no
event shall the tower be able to accommodate fewer than one additional antenna
for one additional provider. Antenna towers are not permitted to be built to a
height which exceeds the applicant's service need as substantiated by the
testimony of a radio frequency engineer. If the tower must be extended in the
future to accommodate co-location, the initial tower foundation must be
designed to support this co-location capacity, and the tower must be designed
to accommodate this extension capability. The antenna tower setback defined in
subsection (c) hereof must be based on the ultimate co-location tower height
planned. This ultimate height must be specified on the drawings submitted.
Tower height shall not be extended until co-locators are installed. Agreement
to this provision must be included in the lease by the landowner, if different
from the owner/operator of the wireless tower or antenna. Written documentation
must be presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission evidencing that the
landowner of the property on which the tower is to be located has agreed to the
terms of this section as well as the requirements, regulations and standards
established in this chapter. As an additional condition of issuing the permit
to construct and operate the wireless tower or antenna in the City, the owner/
operator of the tower is required to sign a statement that all disputes with
future providers concerning co-location and the terms and conditions of co-
location shall be submitted to commercial arbitration under a system selected
by the parties, but if the parties are unable to agree, then under the auspices
of the Commercial Arbitration Provisions of the American Arbitration
Association.
   (b)   Separation. There shall be a separation of at least one quarter mile
between new antenna towers. The Planning and Zoning Commission may waive this
requirement for the purposes of clustering of towers and placement of towers on
electric high tension towers or if the tower being considered for co-location
is not capable of supporting additional antennas.
   (c)   Setbacks and Lot Area.
      (1)   Wireless communications facilities shall meet the minimum yard
setback requirements as set forth in this Zoning Code for the zoning district
in which the antenna and/or tower is proposed to be located. The lot on which
the facility is located shall meet all lot area requirements for that zoning
district. All new antenna towers shall provide the minimum setback defined by
this chapter. Setback distances shall be measured from the property line on
which the wireless communications facility is located to the closest point on
the perimeter of the antenna tower, excluding guy wires and other similar
miscellaneous stabilizers.
      (2)   Exceptions to antenna tower height and setback requirements:
         A.   New and replacement antennas located on or attached to any
existing or new municipal water tower(s) located within the City of
Pickerington; and
         B.   New antenna attached to the existing tower and a replacement
tower up to 150 feet in height.
   (d)   Antenna Tower Design. All new and replacement wireless towers or
antennas in the City shall be an approved design. If an antenna is installed on
a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and
mechanical equipment must be a neutral color that is identical to, or closely
compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the
antenna and its supporting equipment as unobtrusive as possible as determined
by the City.
   (e)   Materials. Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish,
noncontrasting gay or similar color that will minimize its visibility. The City
reserves the right to require that these towers be painted a color so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness. If required by the FAA, towers may be painted
pursuant to FAA or ODOT requirements.
   (f)   Service Equipment. The Development Services Director may require that
all cable, conduit, piping, equipment and miscellaneous devices serving
wireless telecommunication facilities shall be either buried or concealed
within the structures involved if the aesthetics of the surrounding area
dictate, except when otherwise required by the Ohio Building Code and the
National Electrical Code. Towers located in commercial, industrial or
manufacturing areas shall meet the requirements of the zoning district in which
they are located.
   (g)   Accessory Structures. All principal structures, accessory structures,
buildings, shelters and equipment enclosures, together with supporting
development, including, but not limited to, fence enclosures, driveways, gates
and miscellaneous pavement serving and supporting the operation of the antenna
tower(s) and antenna(s), shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Compatibility. All development, including, but not limited to,
buildings, shelters, enclosures, driveways, gates and miscellaneous pavement
located in other zones shall meet the zoning standards of the underlying zone.
Buildings, shelters, enclosures, driveways, gates and miscellaneous pavement
located in other zones shall meet the zoning standards of the underlying zone
and shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding
environment, as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (2)   Development Services Director authority. When the antenna and
antenna tower are a conditional use the Development Services Director shall
review and approve the final design of all accessory buildings, shelters and
enclosures for compliance with this chapter prior to the issuance of a permit.
The Development Services Director may require additional plans, design
modifications, and material specification changes and impose conditions of
approval as are felt to be necessary to ensure building and/or shelter
compatibility with the surrounding area.
   (h)   Storage. Outdoor storage of any supplies, vehicles or equipment
related to the use of the facility is prohibited.
   (i)   Fences. Screen fencing shall be provided for aesthetic and public
safety reasons when the wireless communication facility, tower or antenna is
ground based. All impact facilities are subject to this requirement. A fence
six feet in height will be erected completely around the communication tower
and any related support facilities. Fencing should be appropriate for the area
in which the tower or antenna is to be located and compatible with the
surrounding environment and the applicable City codes.
   (j)   Landscape. A landscaped buffer area compatible with the surrounding
environment and the zoning district in which the facility is to be located
shall be provided. If the tower is to be located in close proximity to a
Residential District, the Development Services Director may require landscaping
consistent with that of the adjacent area. Such landscaping may include, but
not be limited to:
      (1)   A landscape buffer of not less than ten feet in depth shall be
placed between the wireless tower or antenna and the public rights-of-way,
Residential Zoning Districts, and any adjacent residential uses when the
wireless facility is ground based.
      (2)   The ten foot landscape buffer shall consist of a tight screen fence
of hardy evergreen shrubbery not less than six feet in height.
      (3)   The landscaping shall be continuously maintained and any dead
material shall be promptly removed and replaced with living material of the
same species. Additional or alternative landscaping buffers may be required by
the Planning and Zoning Commission to meet the goals of the City and to be
consistent with the surrounding area. All impact facilities and roof-top
facilities are subject to this requirement.
   (k)   Illumination. Except as required by law, a wireless tower or antenna
shall not be illuminated, and lighting fixtures or signs shall not be attached
to the antenna or tower. If lighting is required by FAA regulations, white
strobe lights shall not be permitted at night unless no other alternative is
permitted by the FAA. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and
design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
Lighting for security purposes shall be permitted at the wireless
communications facility with prior approval of the review authority specified
in this chapter for the application involved.
   (l)   Advertising. No advertising shall be permitted on any wireless
communications facility.
   (m)   Security. No-trespassing signs shall be posted around the wireless
communications facility with a telephone number of a person to contact in the
event of an emergency.
   (n)   Certification. Towers and antennas shall be designed and sealed by a
registered professional engineer in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio
Building Code and the National Electrical Code.
   (o)   Building Codes: Safety Standards. The owner of a wireless
communications facility as defined in this chapter shall ensure that said
facility is maintained in compliance with standards contained in all applicable
State or local building codes and the applicable standards for such facilities
published by the Electronic Industry Association as now exist or may hereafter
be amended. If, upon inspection, the City determines that the facility fails to
comply with any such codes or standards and constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then upon written notice being provided to the owner of the facility,
said owner shall have thirty days to bring said facility into compliance with
such codes and standards. Failure to bring said facility into compliance within
the said thirty days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the facility
at the owner's expense.
   (p)   License to Operate. Owners and operators of wireless communications
facilities shall submit copies of all franchises, certifications, licenses, and
permits required by law for the design, construction, location and operation of
wireless communications facilities within the City of Pickerington. Owners and
operators shall be required to maintain same and to provide evidence of renewal
or extension thereof when requested by the City.
   (q)   Underground Equipment Shelters. Underground equipment shelters will be
required when appropriate screening of such shelters cannot be accomplished.

this chapter shall so notify the City of Pickerington and shall bring such
facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within
ninety days of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a
different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling State, County or
Federal agency. Failure to bring such towers and antennas into compliance with
said revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal
of the tower or antenna at the owner's or operator's expense.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1294.16   ABANDONMENT OF TOWER.
   All providers utilizing wireless towers or antennas shall present a report
to the City or its designee notifying them of any wireless tower or antenna
located in the City whose use will be discontinued and the date this use will
cease. If at any time the use of said facility is discontinued for 180 days the
City Manager may declare the facility abandoned (excluding any dormancy period
between construction and the initial use of the facility). The facility's
owner/operator will receive written notice from the City or its designee and be
instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within 180 days or dismantle
or remove the facility. In the case of a multi-use tower, this provision shall
not become effective until all of the users cease to use the tower. However,
the City may cause the abandoned portions of the systems on the multi-use tower
to be removed in accordance with this section.
   (a)   Removal. The owner or operator shall agree to remove a nonfunctioning
facility within 180 days of ceasing its use and return the site to its pre-
existing condition.
   (b)   Notice Requirements. The City must provide the tower or antenna owner
or operator ninety days notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Planning and Zoning Commission before the City can initiate removal of the
facility. After such notice the City shall have the authority to initiate
proceedings either to acquire the tower and any appurtenances attached thereto
at the then fair market value, or, in the alternative, to order the demolition
of said tower and all appurtenances.
   (c)   Public Hearing. The City shall provide the tower owner with the right
to a public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission, which public
hearing shall follow the ninety days notice required in subsection (b) hereof.
All interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard at the
public hearing.
   (d)   Acquisition/Removal of Tower. After a public hearing is held pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the Planning and Zoning Commission may order the
acquisition or demolition of the tower. The City shall also exercise its rights
related to any bonding requirements stated in subsection (e) hereof.
   (e)   Bond. The owner or operator shall be required as a condition of
issuance of a permit to post a cash or surety bond acceptable to the Law
Director of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per vertical foot from
natural grade of the wireless communications facility. Said bond shall warrant
that an abandoned, obsolete or destroyed wireless communications facility will
be removed within 180 days of cessation of use and abandonment. If the wireless
communications facility is not removed within 180 days of cessation of use or
abandonment, the owner or operator shall forfeit this bond, but the obligation
to remove the wireless communications facility and restore the site to its pre-
existing condition shall remain. In the event that said facility is not removed
within 180 days of cessation of operations at a site, the facilities may be
acquired or removed by the City and the costs of removal assessed against the
property or recovered by other legal means from the owner or operator. Any co-
locator shall be required to additionally execute such bond, as principal, to
insure that the bond will be in place during the period of time that the co-
locator occupies the tower.

1296.01   REQUIRED LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING.
   (a)   The goal of the landscaping and buffering requirements is to provide
an aesthetically pleasing environment for the City through the provision of
green space, trees, plantings and other screening techniques providing the best
possible compatibility, integration and transition between land uses.
Landscaping and buffering helps mitigate problems associated with noise,
pollution, light, privacy, etc. This section shall apply to all zoning
districts. See
Chapter 1300 for further nonresidential development requirements.
   (b)   Buffer Types.
      (1)   Opaque buffer, Type A. A Type A buffer is the most dense buffer
required. This buffer is to be completely opaque from the ground to six feet
above the ground. Buffering shall be provided by an opaque wood fence, an earth
berm and plant material. Plant material shall include staggered planting of
evergreen trees, at least five feet in height at the time of planting, at
intervals designed to achieve opacity. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
waive any or all of these buffering requirements by a two-thirds majority vote.
      (2)   Semi-opaque buffer, Type B. A Type B buffer is the intermediate
buffer required. This buffer is to be completely opaque from the ground to
three feet above the ground and at least fifty percent opaque from three feet
to six feet above the ground. Buffering shall be provided by plant material
and/or some type of mechanical barrier and/or an earth berm. Plant material
shall reach desired maturity within two years of planting and shall provide the
same level of buffering all year. Plant materials used shall be from the list
provided in subsection (c) hereof. Acceptable options are presented below:

1296.02   YARD MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Setback Requirements.
      (1)   Alleys. In computing the depth of a rear yard or the width of a
side yard, where the rear or side yard abuts an alley, one-half of the width of
the alley may be included as a portion of the required rear or side yard, as
the case may be.
      (2)   Side yard increases. Each side yard shall be increased in width by
two inches in any Residential District for each foot by which the length of the
side wall of the building adjacent to the side yard exceeds forty feet.
      (3)   Irregular side yards. Side yard width may be varied where the side
wall of a building is not parallel with one side lot line or is broken or
otherwise irregular. In such cases, the average width of the side yard shall be
not less than the otherwise required least width. Such side yard, however,
shall not be narrower at any point than one-half the otherwise required least
width, or narrower than three feet in any case. This requirement
notwithstanding, no new addition to any building shall encroach upon the
minimum required side yard.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4050.jpg]
   (b)   Projections Into Yards. There may be projections into required yard
areas as follows:
      (1)   Architectural features. Architectural features such as canopies,
cornices, eaves and other similar features may project a distance of not more
than two feet, six inches.
      (2)   Outside stairs and landings. Outside stairs and landings without
cover may project a distance not more than six feet in front or rear yards, but
in no case shall any such outside stair or landing extend above the entrance.
      (3)   Fire escapes. Fire escapes may project not more than four feet, six
inches.
      (4)   Patios and open porches. Patios and open porches may be located in
side and rear yards provided they are not closer than six feet to any adjacent
property line. If located closer than eight feet, they shall be screened by an
evergreen hedge or fence not less than four feet in height and maintained in
good condition. In case of a corner lot, no patios or porches shall be closer
to the side street lot line than the least depth required for such side yard.
      (5)   Bay windows, balconies, Oreil windows and chimneys. Bay windows,
balconies, Oreil windows and chimneys may project into a yard for a distance
not to exceed three feet, provided, however, that the aggregate width of such
projection does not exceed one-third of the length of the wall upon which it is
located.

   (e)   A porch, patio, deck, breezeway or similar structure may be erected
with an approved pier-type foundation.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.04   FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
   All lots created after the adoption of this Code (Ordinance 89-31, passed
May 16, 1989) shall have a frontage on a public, dedicated and accepted
thoroughfare other than a controlled or limited access thoroughfare.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.05   WATER IMPOUNDMENTS.
   All water impoundments, such as ponds, lakes or swimming pools, shall be
constructed and developed in compliance with the following standards:
   (a)   No impoundment shall be located closer than twenty-five feet to the
right-of-way line of any adjacent public right-of-way.
   (b)   No private swimming pool shall be located in a front yard.
   (c)   All installed swimming pools, or the entire property upon which they
are located, shall be walled or fenced to prevent uncontrolled access by
individuals from the street or from adjacent properties. Such wall or fence
shall be not less than four feet in height measured from the finished grade,
shall be maintained in good condition with a gate and lock and shall be
constructed of such material as to preclude penetration by any child or adult.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.06   STRUCTURE SEPARATION.
   Notwithstanding other provisions of this Code, no building shall be located
closer than five feet to another building unless the adjacent walls of both
buildings are constructed so as to provide a minimum fire resistance rating of
two hours.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.07   EMERGENCY HOUSING.
   The Development Services Director may, in times of emergency, permit the
placement of not more than one mobile home on any lot for use as temporary
housing by any family or resident whose dwelling has been rendered
uninhabitable by flood, fire, wind or other catastrophe. Such mobile home may
remain on the lot for a period not to exceed one year, subject to renewal for
special circumstances as determined by the Development Services Director, and
may be occupied only so long as reconstruction of the original dwelling or
construction of a new, permanent dwelling is underway.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.08   STATE ROUTE 256 CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Environmental Treatment. The following guidelines set development
standards for the State Route 256 corridor. These standards apply to the
developer, to any contiguous landowners and to governmental agencies involved
in modifications along this section of the corridor. The appropriateness of
materials will vary with the type of development that occurs along this
corridor.
   (b)   Lighting.
      (1)   Street lighting. Street lighting along State Route 256 should
utilize similar fixtures along the entire corridor to promote identity and
continuity, as well as provide a sufficient level of light.
      (2)   Parking lot lighting.
         A.   Retail. The light source should be concealed and cut off in
design. Fixtures should be twelve feet to thirty feet in height with dark
poles. (See Appendix I following the text of this chapter.)
         B.   Multi-family. The light source should be decorative in style and
provide natural color. Fixtures should be twelve feet to thirty feet in height
with dark poles. (See Appendix I following the text of this chapter.)
   (c)   Signage. The following sign standards shall apply within the corridor:
Signage should help to unify the corridor. The design, format and materials
shall be consistent with the architecture and shall conform to Municipal
standards.
   (d)   Screening for Parking and Roadway. Parking areas should be screened
from State Route 256 and intersecting roads to minimize the visual impact of
large paved areas and parked automobiles. This allows the landscape and the
architecture to dominate and will also prevent distraction from automobile
headlights. The following methods may be used to achieve this:
      (1)   Earth berms. Earth berms shall be approximately three feet to five
feet in height, shall have a maximum slope of 2:1 and shall be seeded or sodded
with a good quality grass which can be mowed or planted with ground cover or
plantings. (See Appendix II following the text of this chapter.)
      (2)   Landscaping.
         A.   Plant material shall be a mixture of deciduous shade trees,
evergreen trees and smaller ornamental trees. Plants shall be grouped in like
clusters to provide a desirable visual effect. Evergreen and ornamental trees
shall be used to screen views, and shade trees shall be used for filtered
views.
         B.   Where space is restricted, a hedge-type plant is preferred.
Mature height shall approximate forty inches and plants shall be spaced tightly
enough to provide a dense screen. (See Appendix II following the text of this
chapter.) All modification by governmental agencies along and within this
corridor shall provide landscape and environmental treatment consistent with
that of the development standards, as outlined herein.
      (3)   Fencing. Fencing provides an "edge" to a site and promotes
continuity when used properly. Fencing shall be limited to the rail or picket
type and shall be in scale with the development. (See Appendix II following the
text of this chapter.)
      (4)   Combination. A combination of earth berm and landscaping is
preferred for the entire corridor except for the area north of the north branch
of Hunter's Run Creek, where a combination of hedge and/or fencing may be
utilized.
   (e)   Viewing Triangles. A triangular area with the approximate dimensions
of thirty feet by fifty feet by sixty feet (as measured from the edge of
pavement) should remain open and unplanted to allow adequate visibility for
automobiles entering and exiting the site. This applies to all private curb
cuts and public streets. (See Appendix I following the text of this chapter.)
   (f)   Landscaping. Within rights-of-way.
      (1)   In general. All unpaved areas within the public rights-of-way must
be seeded (or sodded) with a grass seed mixture containing fifty-five percent
Kentucky Bluegrass, thirty percent Red Fescue and fifteen percent Perennial Rye
Grass. These lawn areas must be mowed regularly and should be re-seeded as
needed to prevent large, bare dirt areas. If trees are planted in these areas,
they must be maintained in a good healthy condition. Dead or diseased trees
must be removed promptly at or below the soil level.
      (2)   Proposed median on State Route 256. When the dimensions of a median
exceed six feet in width (from the face of the curb), it shall not be paved,
but should be planted with lawn and/or landscaping instead.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.09   UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   Nothing in this Code shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by the
proper authority.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.10   INTERFERENCE WITH TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.
   (a)   Traffic Signs. Notwithstanding other provisions of this Code, no sign,
structure, tree, planting, vegetation or any portion thereof shall protrude
over or into the right-of-way of any street, road or highway so as to interfere
with traffic signs of any kind in any zoning district.
   (b)   Required "Sight Triangles". A "sight triangle," defined as that area
from the intersection point of a street right-of-way on the lot to a point
twenty feet back from this point on the lot lines, shall be required on corner
lots at all street intersections. To ensure that traffic visibility is not
obstructed and driving hazards are not created, visibility between two and ten
feet above the ground shall be clear of landscape materials, vehicles, fences,
signs or any other view obstructing structures. Only deciduous trees may be
permitted in the sight triangle, so long as only the trunk is visible within
ten feet above the ground, except during early growing stages.

   (c)   Thoroughfare Plans/Access Policy. In addition to the frontage,
driveway and set-back requirements herein, there may be additional requirements
placed on roadways in the Municipality pursuant to the Thoroughfare Plan or the
Access Code.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.11   REQUIRED UTILITIES; UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION.
   (a)   In every case where a lot is not provided with a public water supply
and/or the disposal of sanitary wastes by means of public sewers, and where new
construction or expansion of a use by more than twenty percent is proposed and
public water and/or public sewer services exist within 200 feet of the property
and have the capacity to connect and service the subject site, the site shall
be connected at the owner's expense to these utilities. Should available public
water and/or public sewer service not exist within 200 feet of the site, then
the proposed method of water supply and/or sewage disposal shall have the
written approval of the appropriate Board of Health and the appropriate water
and/or sewer departments. Water wells may be drilled for nonpotable or
nondomestic use in any district, subject to the same approvals.
   (b)   In every case where a previously undeveloped lot, vacant lot or site
is to be developed, all utilities shall be placed underground unless
specifically exempted by approval of the Development Services Director.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1296.12   VEGETATION OR GROUND COVER REQUIRED.
   To control erosion of the development site by water and wind, every site
under development shall be planted to a suitable ground cover according to the
charts below.
   (a)   Site Preparation. Topsoil should be stripped and stockpiled before
grading operations. After grading is completed, the topsoil can then be applied
to sites that are otherwise unsuited for establishing vegetation.
   (b)   Seeding Recommendations.
      (1)   Use lime at the rate of 150 pounds per 1,000 square feet or three
tons per acre.
      (2)   Fertilize with a minimum of twelve to fifteen pounds per 1,000
square feet or 500-600 pounds per acre of 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 or equivalent.
      (3)   Mulch immediately after planting with straw or rotted hay at the
rate of 100 pounds per 1,000 square feet or two tons per acre. (Seedings made
after November 1 will be dormant seedings and mulch should be increased to
three tons per acre.)
   (c)   Temporary Vegetative Plantings (Less Than Six Months).

(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1300.02   PURPOSE.
   The City of Pickerington is a progressive community that has and will
continue to experience a high-rate of nonresidential growth. The purpose of
these standards is to provide clear and reliable standards for quality and
sustainable nonresidential development, to promote orderly growth, and to
maintain a quality community image. These standards establish requirements for
site plan development, exterior building appearance and materials, landscaping,
lighting, and signage.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1300.03   RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CHAPTERS.
   The provision of these standards shall supplement any and all other
regulations of the State of Ohio and ordinances of the City. Whenever the
requirements of these regulations are in conflict with the requirement of any
other part of this Zoning Ordinance, the more restrictive or that which imposes
the higher standards shall govern.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1300.04   CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   Applicability.
      (1)   A certificate of appropriateness is required for all nonresidential
sites, buildings or structures within the City. Each certificate of
appropriateness shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The Development Services Director is authorized, at their sole
discretion, to require that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained before
any work that exceeds simple repairs or ordinary maintenance is performed.
      (2)   Certificates of appropriateness are required for site plan
development, building material, landscaping, lighting and signage compliance,
and shall be required for:
         A.   Any new construction.
         B.   Any significant alteration to the site plan, landscape, or
lighting features which would alter the respective appearance of that feature.
         C.   Any new signs or alterations to existing signs.
         D.   Any significant alteration, expansion, or exterior renovation to
an existing building or structure.
         E.   An alteration, expansion, or renovation is considered significant
when it meets or exceeds the following criteria:
            1.   In the case of a building or structure expansion that does not
involve additional land, the square footage of the alteration or expansion
exceeds ten percent of the square footage of the existing building exclusive of
the alteration or expansion;
            2.   In the case of an alteration or expansion involving both an
existing building or structure and additional land, and, if applicable,
additional structures or buildings, the area or square footage of the altered
or expanded land or structure or building, respectively, exceeds ten percent of
the area or square footage of the existing land or structure or building
respectively, exclusive of the alteration or expansion; or
            3.   If the cost of the exterior renovation of the structure
exceeds twenty-five percent of the assessed value of the property prior to
renovations.
   (b)   Standards of Review. In the review of proposed developments, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine whether or not the proposed
development, as depicted on the site plan, complies with the following:
      (1)   The plan conforms in all pertinent respects to the requirements
contained herein;
      (2)   Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian and
vehicular circulation within the site and to adjacent property;
      (3)   The development has adequate public services and open spaces;
      (4)   The development preserves and is sensitive to the natural
characteristics of the site in a manner that complies with the applicable
regulations set forth in this Code;
      (5)   The development provides adequate lighting for safe and convenient
use of the streets, walkways, driveways, and parking areas without
unnecessarily spilling or emitting light onto adjacent properties or the
general vicinity;
      (6)   The proposed signs, as indicated on the submitted sign plan, will
be:
         A.   Coordinated within the development;
         B.   Are of an appropriate size, scale, and design in relationship
with the principal building, site, and surroundings; and
         C.   Are located so as to maintain safe and orderly pedestrian and
vehicular circulation;
      (7)   The landscape plan will enhance the principal building and site;
maintain existing trees as required in these standards; buffer adjacent
incompatible uses; break up large expanses of pavement with natural material;
and provide appropriate plant materials for the buildings, site, and climate;
      (8)   Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and through
the site in compliance with the applicable regulations in this Code and any
other design criteria established by the City or any other governmental entity
which may have jurisdiction over such matters;
      (9)   If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages, each
stage shall be so planned that the foregoing conditions are complied with at
the completion of each stage; and
      (10)   The Commission believes the project to be in compliance with all
other local, State and Federal laws and regulations.
   (c)   Equivalency or Waiver of Requirements. The Commission may waive any or
all of these standards or approve an equivalency by a two-thirds vote if it
finds that the proposed alternative meets or exceeds the purpose and intent of
these standards.
   (d)   Simple Repairs & Ordinary Maintenance. Projects involving simple
repairs or ordinary maintenance do not require a certificate of
appropriateness. However, a zoning certificate documenting the simple repair/
ordinary maintenance is required to be submitted and approved administratively.
If the Development Services Director finds such simple repair will change the
appearance of the site, building, landscaping, or lighting to a degree that
constitutes a significant alteration, a certificate of appropriateness shall be
required.
   (e)   Permission to Build and Certificate of Occupancy.
      (1)   Approval for permission to build shall not be issued unless the
applicant has been issued a zoning certificate that complies with all
certificates of appropriateness approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (2)   A full certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until the terms
of the certificate of appropriateness are met, as certified by an on-site
inspection by the Development Services Director or his agent, unless a
performance bond, or irrevocable letter of credit from a banking institution,
has been posted. If the required terms of the certificate of appropriateness
have not been completed and a certificate of partial occupancy (temporary) is
issued, a performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit from a banking
institution shall be posted at that time.
   (f)   Construction Activity. No construction, reconstruction, alteration,
expansion, or renovation of any site, building, landscaping, sign, or lighting
element within the nonresidential areas of the City shall be undertaken prior
to obtaining a certificate of appropriateness. Changes made by the applicant or
his agents during the design or construction process after the certificate of
appropriateness is approved and the zoning certificate is issued shall be
reviewed for appropriateness before the certificate of occupancy is issued. A
significant change (see subsection (b) hereof) shall be reviewed and approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission, while a minor change may be approved
administratively by the Development Services Director.
   (g)   Application Requirements. An application that complies with the
certificate of appropriateness standards of review (see subsection (b) hereof),
with the appropriate fees, shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Department for review and presentation to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
The Development Services Director and/or the Planning and Zoning Commission may
require additional submittal information.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1300.05   SITE PLAN DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Requirements. All nonresidential developments shall comply with the minimum
standards of the Planning and Zoning Code. In addition, the Planning and Zoning
Commission reviews compliance with engineering, building code, fire department,
etc., requirements.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1300.06   ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose. To promote the design and construction of nonresidential
buildings that support and enhance the residential character traditionally
associated with the City of Pickerington through standards for building mass,
roof forms, exterior materials, and architectural detailing. The architectural
standards established herein will reinforce this desired identity and produce
nonresidential development that is compatible with existing and future
residential neighborhoods.
   (b)   Building Scale & Massing. The relationship of a building's height to
its apparent width is a factor in the overall character of the building.
Nonresidential buildings in Pickerington shall respect the human-scale and the
scale of adjacent buildings. The following standards shall apply to
nonresidential buildings as specified:
      (1)   Variation in massing.
         A.   A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided.
         B.   A building's vertical and horizontal dimensions shall be related
to each other through the use of bays or articulation that visually separate
the building planes into components with proportions that emphasize neither the
vertical nor horizontal dimension beyond a ratio of 2.3. Figure 10 below shows
a series of facades with various proportions and articulation.
FIGURE 10

IMAGES/0-0-0-4056.jpg]
   Figure 10: The illustration shows the proportions of facades in a
traditional-style commercial street which range from 1:1 to a 2:1 vertical to
horizontal proportion. These proportions are commonly associated with the
"human-scale". The second facade is an example of an unarticulated box-type
store front. Without articulation, the building appears flat and lacks
character. The general vertical to horizontal ratio of this facade is 2:9,
which emphasizes the horizontal dimension. The third facade shows the same
general area as the second with the addition of both horizontal and vertical
articulation through the use of bays and gabled roof forms with dormers. Each
bay or portion of the facade has a 2:1 proportion except the entry bay, which
has a 2:3 proportion that helps add emphasis to the entry
         C.   Buildings shall have a clearly defined base, middle and top. See
Figure 11 below.
            1.   A recognizable base may consist of, but is not limited to:
thicker walls, ledges, or sills; integrally-textured materials such as stone or
masonry; integrally-colored and patterned materials such as smooth-finished
stone or tiles; lighter or darker colored materials from the body of the
building; mullions; or panels. The use of bulkheads and water table trims are
strongly encouraged.
            2.   A recognizable top may consist of, but is not limited to:
cornice treatments, other than just colored stripes or bands, variation in
masonry pattern or material or differently colored materials; sloping roof with
overhangs and brackets; stepped parapets; or aligned openings and
articulations.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4058.jpg]
   Top of Building:
   Cupola, variation in roof form, visible roof form, clerestory windows,
overhanging eaves.
   Middle of Building:
   Fenestration, belt course, primary building material of brick.
   Base of Building:
   Stone “foundation”, watertable, variation of the materials on first floor,
emphasized entryway, foundation plantings
      (2)   Articulation.
         A.   Primary facades. Primary facades on all nonresidential buildings
shall be articulated both vertically and horizontally to relate the structure
to the human scale.
            1.   Horizontal articulation. Horizontally long facades with a
length exceeds sixty feet shall be articulated through the use of bays. Bays no
greater than thirty feet in length shall be created through the use of no fewer
than two of the following methods:
               a.   Change in wall plane such as a projection or recess. The
change in depth from one bay to the next shall be a minimum of three percent of
the length of the facade.
               b.   Change in height of wall and/or variation in roof form.
               c.   Change in texture or masonry pattern.
               d.   Windows.
               e.   Trellises with vines.
               f.   Other architectural elements and detailing such as
pilasters (see trim & details) that subdivide the facade into human-scale
proportions.
FIGURE 12

IMAGES/0-0-0-4060.jpg]
   This side view of a front facade shows how setbacks or changes in wall plane
were used to achieve horizontal articulation. The facade also incorporates
variation in building materials, pilasters, and variation in wall height to
provide definition from one bay to another.
            2.   Vertical articulation.
               a.   Primary facades which have total building heights over
fifteen feet but not more than twenty feet shall be vertically articulated to
present the appearance of a clerestory, half-story, or multiple full stories
through one of the following methods:
                  (1)   Exterior demarcation of the change in floors such as a
soldier course, belt course, change in material, or masonry patterns every
twelve feet or portion thereof, of vertical height, with multiple rows of
windows placed at various heights including clerestory or transom windows in
the case of a half-story. See Figure 13.
                  (2)   Shed, gabled, or hipped roof forms with dormers which
have windows or vents. See Figure 14.
                  (3)   Vertical recess of wall plane to a depth of at least
three percent of the building's depth, with window openings in the recessed
wall indicating the presence of an upper-story. See Figure 15.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4066.jpg]
               b.   Primary facades which have total building heights over
twenty feet shall be vertically articulated to present the appearance of at
least two full stories through one of the methods listed below:
                  (1)   Exterior demarcation of the change in floors such as a
soldier course, belt course, change in material, or masonry patterns every
twelve feet, or portion thereof, of vertical height with fenestration in each
vertical component of the facade to indicate multiple stories (See the
fenestration and windows section for required window openings). See Figure 13.
                  (2)   Vertical recess of wall plane to a depth of at least
three percent of the building's depth, with fenestration (See the fenestration
and windows section for required window openings.) in the upper and lower
portions of the facade indicating the presence of an upper-story. See Figure 15
above.
               c.   Primary facades shall have a clear base, middle, and top
portion emphasized by the articulation to a human-scale. The primary facades
should incorporate a variety of architectural design features, techniques,
patterns, materials, and colors in a coordinated manner that relate to the
overall design of the structure.
         B.   Visible secondary facades.
            1.   Horizontal articulation. Horizontally long secondary facades
with a length over sixty feet that are visible from public areas shall be
articulated through the use of bays. Bays no greater than thirty feet in length
shall be created through the use of no fewer than two of the following methods:
               a.   Change in wall plane such as a projection or recess. The
change in depth from one bay to the next shall be a minimum of three percent of
the length of the facade;
               b.   Change in height of wall and/or variation in roof form;
               c.   Change in texture, material, or masonry pattern;
               d.   Windows or fenestration using "blanks" (See fenestration
and windows section);
               e.   Trellises with vines; or
               f.   Other architectural detailing or accents (See the trim and
detailing section) that subdivide the facade into human-scale proportions. See
Figure 16 below.
FIGURE 16

IMAGES/0-0-0-4068.jpg]
   This secondary facade is visible from a public road. The articulation has
been carried over from the primary facade and incorporates variation in
building materials and colors as well as a belt course and other trim details
to break-up the facade. Variation in wall height has also been employed.
            2.   Vertical articulation.
               a.   Secondary facades visible from public rights-of-way, public
areas, or residential areas (See definition of visibility from adjacent
residential use.) that have exterior wall heights over fifteen feet but no more
than twenty feet shall be vertically articulated to present the appearance of a
clerestory, half-story, or multiple full-story buildings through one of the
following methods:
                  (1)   Exterior demarcation of change in floors such as a
soldier course, belt course, change in material, or masonry patterns, every
twelve feet or portion thereof, of vertical height, with multiple rows of
windows placed at various heights including clerestory or transom windows in
the case of a half story.
                  (2)   Shed, gabled, or hipped roof forms with dormers that
have windows or vents.
               b.   Secondary facades visible from public rights-of-way, public
areas, or residential areas (See definition of visibility from adjacent
residential use.) with exterior wall heights over twenty feet shall be
vertically articulated to present the appearance of at least two full stories
through one of the methods listed below:
                  (1)   Exterior demarcation of change in floors such as a
soldier course, belt course, change in material, or masonry patterns, no less
than every twelve feet of vertical height, with fenestration in each vertical
component of the facade to indicate multiple stories.
                  (2)   Vertical recess of wall planes to a depth of at least
three percent of the building's width, with fenestration in the upper and lower
portions of the facade indicating the presence of an upper-story.
                     Secondary facades visible from public rights-of-way,
public areas or residential areas shall have a clear base, middle, and top
portion emphasized by the articulation to a human-scale (see definition of
visibility from adjacent residential use). The secondary facades should
incorporate a variety of architectural design features, techniques, patterns,
materials and colors in a coordinated manner that relate to the overall design
of the structure. (See trim and detailing section.)
         C.   Screened secondary facades.
            1.   Secondary facades facing other secondary facades of
nonresidential buildings and are not visible from adjacent residential or
public areas need not be articulated.
            2.   Secondary facades or portions of secondary facades completely
screened from public or residential areas by dense landscaping or other
structures shall not be required to include elements of articulation.
      (3)   Roof forms.
         A.   Purpose. Roof forms contribute substantially to the bulk or mass
of a building. A balance between facade and roof form are important to promote
more visually interesting buildings that relate to the human-scale and prevent
bland box-like structures. Roof form will help relate nonresidential buildings
to the preferred residential character for the City. Pitched roof forms are
preferred for nonresidential structures but flat and asymmetric forms may also
be appropriate as described below.
         B.   Pitched roofs. Pitched roof forms promote the residential
character desired and shall be the preferred roof form for new nonresidential
buildings or portions thereof. See Figure 17 below for types of pitched roofs.
FIGURE 17
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4070.jpg]
   Pitched roof forms.
            1.   Appropriate pitched roof forms for nonresidential structures
include: gables (front or side), gabled with gabled or shed dormers, compound
gabled, double gabled, hipped, or combinations of any of these forms. Gambrel
and mansard roofs are generally discouraged on office or commercial buildings
but may be appropriate on industrial buildings, some civic buildings, and gas
station canopies.
            2.   Shed roof forms may be used as overhangs or in place of
parapets on large-scale retail buildings, office buildings, or industrial
buildings where full gabled roof forms or hipped roofs would be cost
prohibitive or impractical. See Figure 18.
FIGURE 18
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4072.jpg]
   Use of shed roofs on all facades of a building allows for a void in the roof
form to house equipment while still conveying the impression of a gabled or
hipped roof when viewed from the ground. This roof would be further improved
with dormers.
            3.   Shed roof forms in place of parapets (See facade extensions
and parapets.) shall only be used on buildings with an exterior wall height in
excess of eighteen feet.
            4.   When used in place of a parapet, a shed roof form shall be
used in a consistent application on all facades visible from public spaces or
residential areas to portray the appearance of a gabled or hipped roof form.
The pitch on a shed roof is encouraged to be between 5:12 and 14:12. See Figure
19.
FIGURE 19
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4074.jpg]
            5.   When the height of a pitched roof on a retail or office
structure is forty percent or more of the total height of the building and
extends horizontally more than forty feet without a break or variation in roof
form, dormers shall be used to break-up the roof plane or primary facades. See
Figure 20.
FIGURE 20
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4076.jpg]
         C.   Flat roofs. Flat roofs allow for practical application on large
structures and provide variety and flexibility in nonresidential building
design. The following standards shall apply to the use of these roof forms in
nonresidential buildings:
            1.   Flat roofs shall not be permitted as the primary roof form on
buildings with a total building height less than eighteen feet or gas station
canopies.
            2.   Flat roofs may be permitted on visible sides or rears of
large-scale retail, office, civic, or industrial structures provided the
following criteria are met:
               a.   Rooftop equipment is not visible from public spaces or
adjacent residential areas (See definition of visible from adjacent residential
areas.); and
               b.   Dimensional cornice moldings that coordinate with the
overall design of the structure are used to cap the wall.
            3.   Flat roofs on primary facades of any nonresidential building
shall only be permitted if:
               a.   They are capped by a dimensional cornice molding that
vertically measured is a minimum of five percent of the exterior wall height,
coordinates with the overall design of the structure, and projects a minimum of
four inches from the surface of the facade. See Figure 21;
FIGURE 21
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4078.jpg]
               b.   Rooftop equipment is not visible from public spaces or
adjacent residential areas; and
               c.   A minimum of twenty-five percent of the lower portions of
the facade with which the flat roof is associated incorporates either awnings
or overhanging projections to cover walkways. See Figure 22.
FIGURE 22 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4080.jpg]
         D.   Asymmetric or dynamic roofs. Asymmetric or dynamic roof forms
allude to motion, provide variety and flexibility in nonresidential building
design, and allow for unique buildings. Asymmetric or dynamic roof forms shall
be permitted on nonresidential buildings provided the criteria for flat roofs
in paragraph C. above are met. See Figure 23 for an example of a building with
a dynamic roof form.
FIGURE 23
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4082.jpg]
         E.   Facade extensions and parapets. Facade extensions or parapets may
be used on flat roofed structures to create variation and screen rooftop
equipment. The following standards shall apply to facade extensions or
parapets:
            1.   Facade extensions and/or parapets shall be included in the
measurement of total building height and exterior wall height.
            2.   Facade extensions and/or parapets shall be applied in a
consistent manner to all visible facades of a structure to create a consistent
and intentional screen for rooftop equipment without the appearance of a veneer
or flat wall extended beyond the roof form when viewed in profile (See Figure
24). Exceptions may be made by the City for rear facades that are not visible
from public spaces or residential areas.
FIGURE 24

IMAGES/0-0-0-4084.jpg]
   Figure 24: This image shows a thin parapet extension this style is
prohibited. See Figure 25 for preferred alternatives.
            3.   When pitched or gabled roof elements are used over entry
features on otherwise flat roofed structures, the portion of the facade with
the pitched roof should project from the main wall and the pitched roof should
be a minimum of ten percent of the building depth or terminated into a shed or
gabled roof. See examples in Figure 25.
FIGURE 25
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4086.jpg]
   This illustration shows the preferred methods for the use of parapets or
roof forms for facades rather than the use of thin parapets as shown in Figure
24.
      (4)   Overhangs and covered walkways. Overhangs to provide cover for
walkways or shading for windows, awnings, or projecting features that cover a
portion of the facade are preferred over the projection of the whole upper
portion of a primary facade, that can overshadow the articulation of the
building's facade and may create a top heavy appearance.
         A.   Dimensional banding to provide a "marquee" area for signs or
brand identification shall be prohibited.
         B.   Upper portions of primary facades shall not overhang lower
portions of the facades to provide covered walkways or shaded windows unless at
least one of the following conditions is met:
            1.   The overhang is finished with a shed or gabled roof form with
overhanging eaves.
            2.   The height of the overhanging portion of the structure is less
than twenty-five percent of the total building height and supported by piers,
pillars or columns of sufficient width and depth to create the appearance of an
arcade or other architecturally integrated feature that reiterates the
articulation standards established herein. See Figure 26 for examples.
FIGURE 26
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4088.jpg]
   (c)   Gas Station/Service Station Canopies.
      (1)   Purpose. The appearance and scale of a gas station or service
station should not overshadow the architecture or scale of the associated
buildings or adjacent development.
      (2)   Requirements. The following standards are intended to promote
design of these canopies that is sensitive to the residential context of the
City:
         A.   Scale. The total height of canopies shall not exceed that of the
primary structure.
         B.   Roof form. Roof forms identified in Figure 17 shall be used for
all canopies. No flat roofs shall be permitted.
         C.   Materials. Support columns or piers, roofing, and other exterior
finishing materials shall match those used on the site's primary structure and
all elements of the canopy shall be proportioned to each other. See exterior
finish materials & colors.
   (d)   Exterior Finish Materials & Colors.
      (1)   Purpose. These standards are intended to achieve unity of design
through compatible materials and colors in nonresidential development. The
residential character of the City is directly influenced by the appearance of
structures and their finishing materials. Nonresidential structures shall be
finished with high-quality, durable, and attractive natural materials or
manufactured materials with a natural appearance. Exterior finish materials
should have low maintenance requirements and utilize colors that reflect the
traditional residential character of the City.
      (2)   Permitted materials. Exterior finish materials shall be permitted
as applicable. As with articulation, the materials may vary from the primary or
visible facades to the secondary or screened facades. Other new materials
meeting the purpose of these standards may be approved by the City on a case-
by-case basis as a primary or accent building material:
         A.   Primary facades. Primary facades of nonresidential buildings
shall be constructed with a primary exterior covering as defined in Table I:
Permitted Exterior Building Materials. All materials should be the natural
color of the permitted materials.
         B.   Secondary facades. Secondary facades of nonresidential buildings
shall be constructed with a primary exterior covering as defined in Table I:
Permitted Exterior Building Materials. All materials should be the natural
color of the material or permanently colored, stained or painted to match the
colors of the primary materials on the visible facades.
         C.   Primary materials. Primary materials refer to any material or
combination of materials that provide the base covering for the building
usually comprising fifty percent or more of the facade finishing material.
         D.   Accents & detailing.
            1.   Materials considered accent or detailing shall comprise no
more than twenty-five percent of the facades surface. See illustrations in
Figure 27.

Figure 27:
This building facade represents a total of 1,557 square feet excluding the roof
area but including the gable. The area occupied by windows and doors is 548
square feet or 35% of the facade area, leaving 1,009 square feet of building
facade which requires exterior materials. The percentages of the total facade
area are:
5% = 78 square feet
10% = 156 square feet
15% = 234 square feet
25% = 390 square feet
The gray shaded areas represent the area covered with an "accent material"

            2.   Permitted accent or detailing materials for all nonresidential
structures are detailed in Table I: Permitted Exterior Building Materials.
         E.   Conditional or new materials. Materials listed as conditionally
permitted or new materials not listed as prohibited in these standards may be
approved by the City on a case-by-case basis provided the City finds the
proposed material meets the intent of paragraph (d)(1) hereof.
         F.   Facades. Facades of nonresidential buildings shall be constructed
with a primary exterior covering as defined below:
            1.   Large-scale retail or large-scale office. Example buildings
include strip centers, big box retailers, movie theaters, hotels/motels, and
high-rise office.
               a.   Primary facades and visible secondary facades. Primary
facades and visible secondary facades of large-scale retail structure shall
have a primary exterior covering of fifty percent or more of unglazed red-toned
traditional-sized brick, large-scale brick, natural stone, cut stone, fiber
cement siding, brick veneer, or some combination of these materials.
               b.   Screened secondary and rear facades. Screened secondary and
rear facades not visible from residential or public areas may be finished with
tilt-up architectural concrete panels, decorative concrete masonry units,
exterior insulate finish system (EIFS), or any of the permitted materials for
the visible facades. All materials should be permanently colored, stained, or
painted to match the colors of the primary materials on the visible facades.
            2.   Small-scale retail or small-scale office.
               a.   Example buildings include strip centers, restaurants, bars,
banks, general retail, professional offices, daycares, and nursing homes.
               b.   Small-scale retail or office structures shall have a
primary exterior covering or red-toned traditional-sized unglazed brick,
natural or cut stone, natural wood clapboard, fiber cement siding, or some
combination of these materials on all facades.
            3.   Industrial. Example buildings include light industrial; flex
building, office buildings, and storage buildings.
               a.   Primary facades and visible secondary facades. Primary
facades and secondary facades (or any portion thereof) visible from public or
residential areas, shall be finished with red-toned traditional-sized unglazed
brick, large-scale brick, brick veneers, natural stone, cut stone, fiber cement
siding or some combination of these materials. Wood clapboard may be considered
appropriate in some applications.
               b.   Screened secondary and rear facades. Secondary and rear
facades not visible from residential or public areas may be finished with tilt-
up architectural concrete panels, decorative concrete masonry units, EIFS,
cement veneers, metal or steel siding or any of the permitted materials for the
visible facades. All materials shall be permanently colored, stained, or
painted to coordinate or match the materials used in the visible facades.
            4.   Civic & institutional buildings. Example buildings include
schools, universities, public service buildings, hospitals, churches,
auditoriums, and other similar buildings.
               a.   Primary facades and visible secondary facades. Primary
facades and secondary facades visible from roads or residential areas shall
have a primary exterior covering of red-toned traditional-sized brick, large-
scale brick, natural stone, cut stone, natural wood clapboard, fiber cement
siding, brick veneer, decorative concrete masonry units, tilt-up architectural
concrete panels, or some combination of these materials. Cement veneers and
steel siding may be conditionally approved.
               b.   Screened secondary and rear facades. Secondary and rear
facades not visible from residential areas or roads shall be finished with
decorative metal siding, EIFS, or any of the permitted materials for the
visible facades. All materials shall be permanently colored or painted to
coordinate or match the materials used in the visible facades.
         G.   Roofing.
            1.   The following are the permitted materials for visible roofing
on all nonresidential structures:
               a.   Slate;
               b.   Synthetic slate; or
               c.   Dimensional asphalt shingles.
            2.   The City may consider additional or new manufactured materials
that meet the purpose of the materials standards in this section on a case-by-
case basis.
            3.   Retail, industrial, office, and civic buildings may employ
standing seam metal roofing on a limited basis upon approval of the City, when
the application of the material is consistent with the purpose of this section.
            4.   Alternative materials that are consistent with the purpose of
this section, are durable, coordinated with the architecture of the building,
and are of permitted colors as listed in paragraph (d)(3) hereof for visible
asymmetric or dynamic roofs shall be approved on a case-by-case basis.
         H.   Awnings or fabric canopies.
            1.   Awnings or fabric canopies shall be made of canvas or other
durable non-glossy outdoor grade fabric in a permitted color listed below that
coordinates with the overall design of the building.
            2.   Awnings or fabric canopies in a primary or trademarked color
shall not be permitted on any building.
            3.   Awnings or fabric canopies may contain logos or names in
trademarked colors that comply with the sign code.
            4.   Backlit awnings or canopies are prohibited.
      (3)   Permitted colors. Nonresidential buildings shall have primary
materials, accents, roofing, and awnings/canopies finished in the range of the
permitted color palette as follows: browns, warm grays, tans, creams, black,
white, dark reds, dark blues, dark greens, naturally colored stone, brick red,
and red-toned bricks. The City may consider other colors on a case-by-case
basis that comply with the purpose of this section.
      (4)   Color and material variation.
         A.   Primary surfaces and accents. Each building facade shall be
limited to a combination of no more than three coordinated colors and/or
materials including primary and accent materials. Large expanses of white or
very light colors are discouraged.
         B.   Trims and detailing. Trims and detailing may be constructed of
additional materials; however, detailing (e.g. window casings, accent trims,
cornice moldings, etc.) is encouraged to be finished in a material or color
which contrasts with the primary color to add emphasis to the effect of the
trim.
         C.   Transition of materials.
            1.   Same facade. When a transition from one material to another is
made on the same facade, it shall be completed either with appropriate trim or
as an accent with variation such as quoining or reveals based on material
thickness. See Figure 28 for examples.

   This building example shows how a variety of materials can be successfully
transitioned with changes in thickness
            2.   Different facades. When a transition in materials is made from
one facade to another, the transition of materials shall be made at an inside
corner.
      (5)   Masonry.
         A.   Brick patterns (bonds).
            1.   When traditional-sized brick or large-scale brick is used in a
facade, the brick shall be laid in an American Common Bond, Running Bond,
Flemish Bond, or English Bond. Stack Bond may only be used as accent. Soldier
and sailor courses and rowlock courses are also appropriate as accent. See
illustrations below in Figure 29.

            2.   Whitewashed or glazed brick shall only be permitted as
accents.
         B.   Masonry mortars. Masonry mortars shall be of a traditional medium
warm gray or slightly tinted to coordinate with the brick and moderate the
contrast between the brick and mortar. Mortar colored to exactly match the
brick or stone creates a flat appearance and is discouraged. Very white or
light colored mortars also create an artificial appearance and are discouraged.
   (e)   Entries and Doors. Entrances to buildings or tenant spaces shall be
clearly identifiable and enhance the architecture of the building.
      (1)   Identifiable entrances. In all cases, the main entrance of the
building or tenant space should be easily identifiable and should provide a
strong statement for the building using architectural articulation, detailing,
specialty pavement, hardscaping, landscaping or a combination of these
elements.
         A.   Large-scale commercial buildings, industrial building, office
buildings, and civic buildings are particularly encouraged to incorporate
facade projections or variations in roof form to emphasize the location for
customer or main entrances and reemphasize the building's articulation.
         B.   Small-scale commercial and office buildings should also place an
emphasis on main entryways; however, the features should be kept in proportion
with the scale of the overall building mass.
      (2)   Unique business identity. Entrances should be designed to allow
individual business to present a clear business image without compromising the
unity of the facade or the general character of the City. Entries shall not be
solely identified by signage. See Figure 30.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4098.jpg]
   (f)   Fenestration and Windows. Fenestration or the pattern of window
openings in a facade assists with the articulation of the building and improves
the visual appearance of structures.
      (1)   Window scale and proportions. Generally windows with vertical
proportions are closer in style to those traditionally used in residential
architecture and help relate nonresidential buildings to the desired
residential character of the City. However, display windows and other forms of
horizontally oriented windows may be acceptable in larger-scale structures
where the horizontal window openings can be incorporated into the overall
building design. Large expanses of glazing shall not be permitted.
         A.   Windows should generally be between fifty percent and eighty
percent of the floor height in which they are installed.
         B.   Horizontally proportioned windows are encouraged to be divided
into vertically proportioned components either through multi-part windows
(shown in Figure 31) or other divided lights.
FIGURE 31

IMAGES/0-0-0-4102.jpg]
These images show horizontally formatted windows that are divided into vertical
components. Figure 32 shows the appropriate way to incorporate glazing on the
ground floor with a bulkhead used rather than running the glazing to grade
         C.   Windows or glazing shall not be installed to run from grade. A
bulkhead constructed of brick, stone, wood, or fiber cement siding with a
minimum height of eighteen inches shall stand between the base (sill) of the
window and grade. This area should be finished to enhance the architecture of
the building. Inclusion of a water table, knee wall, or kick plate is
encouraged to articulate the base of the facade.
         D.   Windows shall be modulated and separated by structural walls
finished in permitted materials. Fully glazed facades shall not be permitted.
         E.   Multi-story windows may be reviewed and approved by the City on a
case-by-case basis.
      (2)   Fenestration patterns and rhythm. A recognizable pattern or rhythm
shall be established with the placement of window openings.
         A.   Generally, window openings or groups of windows should be
equidistant from one another to create a regular pattern. A horizontal distance
greater than one and one-half times the width of the windows or group of
windows should be avoided unless other elements of the facades detailing or
building articulation help continue an established pattern. For instance, a
series of bays with windows may be alternated with a series of bays without
windows. Figure 33 shows how the grouping of two sets of blanks is separated by
a bay with no windows which is approximately equal in width to the group of
windows. Figure 35 shows fenestration where the spacing between windows is
equal to the width of a window.
FIGURE 33
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4104.jpg]
         B.   When a genuine window opening is not feasible, variation in the
facade's pattern or the use of "blanks" on mortar buildings and shuttered
windows on non-mortar buildings may be considered appropriate. See Item 4.
Blanks below for specifics on blanks.
         C.   Windows on upper stories should generally be vertically aligned
with lower story windows or off-set in a manner that creates an intentional
pattern. If the distance between the lintel of the first floor window and the
second floor windows is greater than two times the height of the upper story
window spandrel panels shall be used. See Figure 34 which shows spandrel panels
used to improve articulation.
FIGURE 34
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4106.jpg]
         D.   Windows used to establish a fenestration pattern should generally
be of the same size; however, smaller or larger windows may be employed to
create variation and interest. Portals or smaller windows that are used in
groupings are examples of this.
      (3)   Glazing. At least fifty-percent of all glazing between two and ten
feet from grade or on the ground floor of commercial buildings shall have a
visible transmittance (VT) of 0.6 or higher. Glazing above twelve feet from
grade may have lower levels. Lower VT levels may be employed in other
nonresidential buildings for climate control purposes; however, fully opaque
glazing or mirrored glazing is prohibited. Spandrel or other opaque glass may
be appropriate in very limited applications as an accent but not as a
replacement for the required window openings.
      (4)   Blanks. Blanks or bricked in openings may be employed in locations
where genuine window openings are not feasible due to internal layout to
continue an established window pattern. However, no more than twenty-five
percent of the openings in a primary facade may be blanks. In masonry, or
stucco buildings the blank may appear to be a bricked or filled in window. On
non-masonry buildings, closed shutters can be used rather than an actual window
to convey the impression of the window. See Figure 35.
FIGURE 35

IMAGES/0-0-0-4108.jpg]
   This office building employs bricked-in openings to continue the rhythm of
open windows where openings were not feasible. This is a side facade which
faces the side of a building of similar design.
      (5)   Required fenestration. Including windows in building facades adds
transparency and thereby helps reduce the bulk and monotony of fully opaque or
solid surfaces. Generally, window openings shall emphasize articulation and
enhance the detailed appearance of the structure. The following standards
describe the required per Len ages of windows on the various facades based on
the type o building. The method to calculate fenestration area is shown in
Figure 36.
FIGURE 36

   This illustration shows how to determine the required area for openings.
This example shows the percentages required for primary facades 50% on the
first story and 25% on the second story. The measurements shown can be applied
to all of the requirements for all building types and percentages, as detailed
in the following standards
         A.   Large-scale commercial.
            1.   Primary facades.
               a.   At least fifty percent of the wall area between two and ten
feet above grade shall consist of windows; however; no more than twenty-five
percent of the windows may be blanks.
               b.   On second floors, at least twenty-five-percent of the wall
area between three feet as measured from that stories finished floor and three
feet down from the finished ceiling shall consist of glazing.
               c.   If a single-story building has a facade taller than twenty
feet the facade area above twelve feet is subject to the same window
requirements as the second floor requirements in paragraph b. above.
            2.   Visible secondary facades.
               a.   On all other publicly visible facades, at least thirty-five
percent of the wall area between two and ten feet above grade shall consist of
window openings, no more than fifty percent of the required openings may be
blanks; and
               b.   On second floors, at least twenty-five percent of the wall
area between three feet as measured from that story's finished floor and three
feet down from the finished ceiling shall consist of glazing.
               c.   If a single-story building has a facade taller than twenty
feet, the facade area above twelve feet is subject to the same window
requirements as the second floor requirements in paragraph b. above.
            3.   Screened secondary facades. No fenestration or window openings
are required on fully screened secondary facades.
         B.   Small-scale commercial.
            1.   Primary facades.
               a.   At least forty percent of the wall area between two and ten
feet above grade shall consist of window openings, no more than twenty-five
percent of the required window openings may be blanks; and
               b.   On second floors, at least twenty-five percent of the wall
area between three feet as measured from that story's finished floor and three
feet down from the finished ceiling shall consist of glazing.
               c.   If a single-story building has a facade taller than twenty
feet the facade area above twelve feet is subject to the same window
requirements as the second floor requirements in paragraph b. above.
            2.   Visible secondary facades.
               a.   At least thirty percent of the wall area between two and
ten feet above grade shall consist of window openings, no more than twenty-five
percent of the required window openings may be blanks; and
               b.   On second floors, at least twenty-five percent of the wall
area between three feet as measured from that story's finished floor and three
feet down from the finished ceiling shall consist of glazing.
               c.   If a single-story building has a facade taller than twenty
feet the facade area above twelve feet is subject to the same window
requirements as the second floor requirements in paragraph b. above.
            3.   Screened secondary facades.
               a.   If a secondary facade is fully screened no windows are
required.
               b.   If a small-scale commercial building is on an outlot and
the rear or secondary facades face or abut parking, or the front of another
commercial use; the following provisions shall apply:
                  i.   At least forty percent of the wall area between two and
ten feet above grade shall consist of fenestration openings. All of the
openings may be blanks.
                  ii.   On second floors, at least twenty-five percent of the
wall area between three feet as measured from that story's finished floor and
three feet down from the finished ceiling shall consist of glazing.
                  iii.   If a single-story building has a facade taller than
twenty feet the facade area above twelve feet is subject to the same window
requirements as the second floor requirements in paragraph ii. above.
         C.   Offices, civic, & institutional.
            1.   Primary and visible secondary facades.
               a.   At least thirty-five percent of the wall area between two
and ten feet above grade shall consist of windows, blanks shall not be
permitted on primary facades, and no more than twenty-five percent of the
required window openings may be blanks on a secondary facade; and
               b.   On upper floors, at least thirty-five percent of the wall
area between three feet as measured from that story's finished floor and three
feet down from the finished ceiling shall consist of glazing.
               c.   If a single-story building has a facade taller than twenty
feet the facade area above twelve feet is subject to the same window
requirements as the upper floor requirements in paragraph b. above.
            2.   Screened secondary facades. A quantity of window openings is
not specified for screened secondary facades; however, the use of regularly
placed windows that provide light and ventilation to the interior of the
building is strongly encouraged. When possible the established fenestration
pattern from the visible facades should be continued on screened secondary
facades.
         D.   Industrial.
            1.   Primary facades. A quantity of window openings is not
specified for the primary facade; however, window openings and blanks are
encouraged to be added to compliment the overall building design and materials.
            2.   Secondary facades. No window openings are required on
secondary facades; however, windows may be added to compliment building design
or be provided for light and ventilation.
   (g)   Trim and Detailing. In addition to the very broad massing and scale of
a building, the application and use of trim and detailing contribute to the
character and quality of a structure and help define a specific style or type
of architecture. While, no specific architectural style is required for
buildings in the City, attention to detail and a high level of finish shall
occur. This section provides standards for the inclusion of architectural trim
and details.
      (1)   Trim. Trims refer to ornamental or projecting framing or design
elements around openings, at corners, along eaves, and other architectural
elements attached to the exterior walls of a building that do not serve a
structural purpose. Applied moldings, woodwork, or other linear finishing
elements that add dimension and definition or an "outline" to elements of a
building's facade are examples of trim. They are applied to cover transitions
in materials, and provide finish to a facade.
         A.   Trim shall be of an appropriate type and scale to convey an
architectural style for a building. Generally, narrow trim should be used on
smaller elements and on smaller buildings while wider trim should be used on
larger structures.
         B.   Trim should be used around facade openings to add dimension and
emphasis.
         C.   Trim should be a contrasting color to the primary facade to help
define the facade openings and articulation. However, the City may approve non-
contrasting trim and detailing if it enhances the articulation and character of
the structure. See Figure 37.

   This building shows the emphasis added by incorporating trim that contrasts
with the main color of the building. The entryway, windows and outline of the
structure are enhanced by the contrast and made clearly visible
      (2)   Detailing. Detailing refers to other elements that are installed,
attached, painted or applied to the exterior of a building or structure for the
purpose of ornamentation or artistic expression and assist in the articulation
of a facade adding dimension or character. Some features included in detailing
are:
         a.   Cornices            h.   water tables, knew walls
         b.   projecting eaves         i.   pillars, piers, pilasters, columns
         c.   gutters and downspouts      j.   decorative ornamentation
         d.   belt courses               i.   terra cotta
         e.   sills                  ii.   tiles
         f.   lintels or hoods            iii.   quoining
         g.   spandrels   
Examples of detailing are shown below in Figure 38. The letters correspond to
the listed items above.

   (h)   Mechanical Equipment. Mechanical equipment shall be screened and/or
incorporated into the architectural design of the building.
      (1)   Rooftop equipment. Rooftop equipment shall be located in a manner
so that it shall be screened from view of the public. It shall be screened by
appropriately designed parapet walls, or other rooftop features such as cupolas
that are architecturally integrated with the overall design of the structure.
      (2)   Ground mounted equipment & service structures. See chapter
regarding landscaping and buffering for service structures for specific
screening requirements.
      (3)   Utility housings. All utility housings, junctions, and other
exterior duct work or conduits shall be painted or permanently colored to match
the basic building material color on which it is located to reduce the impact
of its appearance unless it can successfully be integrated with other trim or
detailing in a manner that enhances the architectural style of the structure.

(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1300.07   RELATIONSHIP TO SURROUNDING USES.
   (a)   Purpose. The City's intention is to ensure transitions between
nonresidential uses to promote development patterns similar in size, scale, and
building characteristics, and to provide for pedestrian friendly connectivity.
   (b)   Transitions Between Nonresidential Land Uses.
      (1)   Applicability. Transitions shall be required to help coordinate new
buildings with their surroundings creating context sensitive structures and
sites that meet the other requirements of these standards.
      (2)   Methods of transition. The following methods of transition shall be
employed as applicable:
         A.   Architectural transitions. Nonresidential development shall
employ a minimum of four of the techniques described below to create
compatibility with surrounding and adjacent developments. (See Figure 40.)
However, in a case where the existing adjacent buildings are nonresidential
structures that are not in conformance with the site or architectural
standards, new structures shall be designed to conform to the more restrictive
elements of these standards and not reiterate inappropriate elements
incorporated in existing structures.
            1.   Use similar building setbacks.
            2.   Use similar building height.
            3.   Use similar building width.
            4.   Use similar window styles, rhythm, and alignment.
            5.   Use similar roof form, building materials, or building color.
            6.   Use similar facade articulation on large nonresidential
buildings.
            7.   Use front-to-front, or side-to-side building orientation,
especially with nonresidential uses that are pedestrian-intensive, for example
restaurants and banks.
FIGURE 40
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4118.jpg]
   To the maximum extent practicable, commercial development shall employ
transition techniques to ensure compatibility with surrounding development,
including adjacent residential development.
         B.   Green transitions.
            1.   Use small green spaces such as courtyards, squares, parks,
plazas, and other similar spaces that can function as community gathering
places and neutral uses.
            2.   Use existing natural features such as natural topography (not
retaining walls), streams, existing stands of trees, and other similar
features.
         C.   Multiple structure development transitions. When office, small-
scale retail, pedestrian-intensive retail or service, civic, or public uses are
planned as part of the same development containing larger-scale or more
intensive retail or industrial uses, the applicant shall site the less intense
uses closer to the adjacent low intensity (residential) uses to provide a
transition.
         D.   Orientation of bothersome or nuisance features.
            1.   Bothersome or nuisance features shall be oriented away from
neighboring uses or toward similar features on adjacent properties. For
example, avoid placing garages, parking lots, or services areas facing the
fronts of residential or other nonresidential structures.
            2.   The City may impose conditions upon the approval of
development applications to ensure that new nonresidential development will be
compatible with existing uses, including but not limited to:
               a.   Placement of trash receptacles;
               b.   Location of delivery and loading zones; and
               c.   Placement and illumination of outdoor vending machines.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)
1300.08   LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING.
   (a)   Purpose. The goal of the landscaping and buffering requirements is to
provide an aesthetically pleasing environment for the City through the
provision of green space, trees, plantings, and other screening techniques
providing the best possible compatibility, integration, and transition between
land uses. Landscaping improvements are required along the perimeter of sites,
along the streetscape, and within interior portions of parking lots. Landscape
plans shall be prepared by a licensed landscape architect in the State of Ohio.
   (b)   Buffers.
      (1)   Applicability. Buffers shall be provided between all nonresidential
uses as required by the Code. The buffer types are described below. The
annotation in the table of A, B, C, refers to the type of buffer. The buffer
types are explained in detail in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) hereof. Although
these standards apply to nonresidential development, new residential
development built next to existing nonresidential development that does not
employ these buffers should consider similar buffering techniques.
      (2)   Opaque buffer Type A.
         A.   A Type A buffer is the most dense buffer required. This buffer is
to be completely opaque from the ground to six feet above the ground. Buffering
shall be provided by an opaque wood fence, stone or brick wall, an earthen berm
and plant material with 100 percent opacity from grade to six feet. Planting
material shall be installed on the residential side of the wall or fence, and
shall include staggered plantings of evergreen, deciduous, and ornamental
trees, shrubs and other ornamental perennial or annual foundation plantings, at
intervals designed to achieve the required opacity. A minimum of one large
shade tree or two small shade trees, one evergreen tree, and five shrubs shall
be provided for every fifty linear feet of buffer fence or wall. Acceptable
options are shown in Figure 41.
         B.   When three story or taller residential buildings are permitted in
the adjacent property, evergreen trees of at least five feet in height at the
time of planting shall be placed along the wall to increase the buffers height
to above ten feet at maturity.
FIGURE 41

IMAGES/0-0-0-4120.jpg]
      (3)   Semi-opaque buffer, Type B. A Type B buffer is the intermediate
buffer. This buffer is to be completely opaque from the ground to three feet
above the ground. Buffering shall be provided by plant material and/or some
type of structural barrier and/or earthen berm. Plant material shall reach
required opacity within two years from planting and shall provide the same
level of opacity all year. A combination of three foot high shrubs, masonry
wall, or earthen berm and either small trees at thirty foot intervals or medium
or large trees at forty foot intervals shall be used to create a buffer.
Examples of acceptable options are presented below in Figure 42.
FIGURE 42
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/44bff6043943c74da9b7c1eb1f30fbba7158e1f1/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4122.jpg]
      (4)   Light buffer, Type C. A Type C buffer is the least intense buffer.
This buffer is to be at least thirty percent opaque from the ground to six feet
above the ground. Buffering shall be provided by plant material and/or some
type of structural barrier and/or earthen berm. Plant material shall reach
desired maturity within two years of planting and shall provide the same level
of buffering all year. A combination of small trees at thirty-foot intervals or
large/medium trees at forty-foot intervals and assorted shrubbery or split rail
fences shall be used to achieve the required thirty percent opacity. Acceptable
options are presented below in Figure 43.
FIGURE 43

IMAGES/0-0-0-4124.jpg]
   (c)   Street Screening.
      (1)   Purpose. The appearance of private development should be
subordinate to the transportation function along rights-of-way and the required
landscaping along the roadway edges should be designed to direct and enhance
the traveling experience. Required mounding shall serve as visual and
acoustical barriers along the roadways.
      (2)   Requirements. Street screening landscaping shall be required for
sites that abut public rights-of-way and private streets to minimize the visual
impact of large paved areas, parked vehicles, light overflow from vehicle
lights, and to create an aesthetically pleasing environment. A combination of
the following methods shall be employed to provide year round screening:
         A.   Earth mounds or berms. Undulating earth mounds shall be
approximately three feet to five feet in height and shall have a maximum slope
of 2:1 (run:rise). The height of the mound shall be determined by the width of
the required parking setback (see Section
1290.02 Location of Parking item (c)) and the maximum slope. Gentler slopes are
encouraged when possible to create a more natural appearance and to provide for
easier maintenance.
         B.   Landscaping. Plant material shall be a mixture of deciduous shade
trees, evergreen trees, smaller ornamental trees, shrubs, flowers, and others
in groupings to form a continuous buffer. Furthermore, continuous mounds with
evenly space trees located on the ridges are prohibited.
            1.   One large shade tree or two small shade trees, one evergreen
tree, and ten shrubs shall be provided for every fifty linear feet of
streetscape frontage.
            2.   Plants shall be in groupings to provide a desirable visual
effect. Evergreen and ornamental trees shall be used in combination to create
variation and provide year round screening.
            3.   Where parking is permitted closer to the right-of-way than
would allow for appropriately sloped earthen mounds, a hedge-type planting is
preferred. Mature height shall be approximately forty inches and plants shall
be spaced tightly enough to provide a dense screen at maturity.
      (3)   Sight triangle. A sight triangle defined as the area from the
intersection point of a street right-of-way on the lot to a point twenty feet
back from this point on the lot lines, shall be required on corner lots at all
street intersections.
         A.   To ensure that traffic visibility is not obstructed and driving
hazards not created, visibility between two and ten feet above the ground shall
be clear of landscape materials, vehicles, fences, signs, or any other view
obstructing structures.
         B.   The required sight triangle may be excluded for calculation of
the required street screening area.
         C.   Deciduous trees may be permitted within the sight triangle if at
maturity a clear distance of ten feet can be achieved, excluding the trunk.
   (d)   Interior Landscaping for Vehicular Use Areas.
      (1)   Purpose. Interior landscaping for vehicular use areas should soften
the appearance of paved areas, assist in management of stormwater through
reduction of impervious surface, and provide shade for nonresidential sites.
      (2)   Requirements. All new nonresidential developments regardless of
type, and all significant alterations, expansions, or renovations to existing
nonresidential developments shall provide interior landscaping for vehicular
use areas. Interior landscaping for vehicular use areas shall consist primarily
of new tree plantings or the preservation of existing trees within the site.
         A.   Landscape area. An area equal to ten percent of the impervious
surface of the vehicular use area shall be designated for interior landscaping.
         B.   Minimum area. The minimum landscape area permitted within a
vehicular use area shall be sixty-four square feet, with a four foot minimum
dimension.
         C.   Maximum contiguous area. In order to encourage the required
landscape areas to be properly disbursed, no individual landscape area used to
meet the minimum requirement shall be larger than 350 square feet in size for
vehicular use areas under 30,000 square feet, and no individual area shall be
larger than 1,500 square feet in vehicular use areas over 30,000 square feet.
Individual landscape areas larger than above are permitted as long as the
additional area is in excess of the required minimum total.
         D.   Minimum required plantings. The following minimums are required,
based upon total ground coverage of vehicular use areas:
            1.   Not less than one tree for each 100 square feet of required
landscape area, or not less than one tree per landscaped area, which ever is
greater.
            2.   Required trees shall have a minimum caliper of two inches at
five feet above the ground.
            3.   Trees shall have a clear trunk of at least five feet above the
ground, and the remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs, or ground
cover, not to exceed two feet in height.
         E.   Vehicle overhang. Parked vehicles may hang over the interior
landscaped area no more than two and one-half feet, as long as concrete or
other wheel stops are provided to insure no greater overhang or penetration of
the landscaped area.
   (e)   Foundation Plantings.
      (1)   Purpose. Foundation plantings shall be required along all primary
facades to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the site.
      (2)   Requirements. There is no specified quantity of plantings required;
however, a combination of ornamental trees, assorted shrubs, ground covers, and
annual plants should be used along all primary facades to enhance the
appearance of the building.
   (f)   Landscape Buffering for Service Structures.
      (1)   Purpose. Landscaping can reduce the visual impact of unsightly
utility and service structures and reduce noise and other nuisance features of
these elements by buffering them.
      (2)   Requirements. All service structures shall be screened from public
view or adjacent residential areas. For the purposes of this section, services
structures shall include but not be limited to loading docks, propane tanks,
dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults extending above grade, and
other equipment or elements providing service to a building or a site.
Structures may be grouped together; however, screening height shall be based
upon the tallest of the structures.
         A.   Issuance of occupancy permit. As these items are not always
included on initial site or building plans, the issuance of an occupancy permit
is contingent upon the inspection of these items by the Development Services
Director.
         B.   Screening.
            1.   A continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall, or earthen mound
shall be built to enclose any service structure on all sides unless such
structure must be frequently moved or accessed, in which case screening on all
but one side is required.
            2.   Dumpsters shall be screened by a brick or stone wall and have
wood doors.
            3.   The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve other types of
screening materials on a case-by-case basis.
         C.   Curbs to protect screening material. The City Engineer shall
determine if a curb is required to protect and contain a trash dumpster or
waste collection unit.
   (g)   Preservation of Existing Landscaping Materials and Wooded Areas. The
City encourages the preservation of trees, landscaping, wooded areas, and other
natural features to maintain and enhance the natural environment. Developers
are encouraged to retain portions of tree stands by using expanded building
setbacks and pruning techniques to open views from the road. All nonresidential
developments shall comply with
Chapter 1266 Preservation of Trees and Wooded Areas.
   (h)   Landscaping & Hardscaping Materials.
      (1)   Purpose. The proposed landscape materials should complement the
form of the existing trees on site or on adjacent sites if none exist on-site
and plantings, as well as the development's general design and architecture.
      (2)   Applicability. These regulations apply to all landscaping and
hardscaping materials installed as part of the requirements of these standards.
      (3)   Types. The type of shade or sun should be considered in selecting
plant materials. The landscaping materials shall consist of the following:
         A.   Walls and fences. To comply with the existing wall and fence
ordinance, for any proposed new nonresidential building, where stone fencing
exists, such stone fencing shall be retained and improved as part of the
approved landscaping. Walls and fences shall be constructed out of materials
that match or coordinate with the building materials on the primary structure.
         B.   Earth mounds or berms. Earth mounds or berms shall be physical
barriers that block or screen a view similar to a hedge, fence, or wall. Mounds
shall be constructed with proper and adequate plant material to prevent
erosion. A difference in elevation between areas where screening is required
does not constitute an existing earth mound. The height of the required mound
shall be measured at the elevation adjacent to the use that requires buffering.
         C.   Plants. Plant materials used in conformance with provision of
this chapter shall conform to the standards of the American Association of
Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspections required under State
regulations.
            Artificial plants are prohibited. All plant materials shall be
living plants and shall meet the following requirements:
            1.   Deciduous trees. Trees which normally shed their leaves in the
fall shall have a minimum caliper of two inches measured at five feet and be
species of small, medium or large maturity size in areas where there is not a
visibility concern.
               a.   In areas with visibility concerns, the trees shall be
species of medium, to large maturity size which can eventually maintain five
feet of branch free trunk with a minimum two inch caliper.
               b.   Trees of species with roots that are known to cause damage
to public roadways or other public works shall not be planted closer than
fifteen feet to such public works, unless the tree root system is completely
contained within a barrier for which the minimum interior containing dimensions
shall be five feet square and five feet deep and for which the construction
requirements shall be four inch thick, reinforced concrete.
            2.   Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of five feet high at the
time of planting.
            3.   Shrubs and hedges shall be at least three feet in average
height when planted and shall conform to the opacity and other requirements
within four years after planting.
            4.   Vines shall be at least twelve inches high at planting, and
generally used in conjunction with walls, fences or trellises.
            5.   Grass or ground cover. Grass of the fescue (Gramineae) or
bluegrass (Poaceae) family shall be planted as species normally grown as
permanent lawns in central Ohio. They may be sodded or seeded, except in swales
or other areas subject to erosion. Where solid sod, erosion reducing net, or
suitable mulch shall be used, nurse-grass seed shall be sown for immediate
protection until complete coverage is achieved. Grass sod shall be clean and
free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Ground cover shall be planted in
such a manner as to present a finished appearance and seventy-five of complete
coverage after two complete growing seasons, with a maximum of eight inches on
center. In certain cases, ground cover may consist of sand, and similar
approved materials.
      (4)   Maintenance and installation.
         A.   All landscaping materials shall be installed in a sound,
workmanship-like manner and according to accepted, good construction and
planting procedures. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the
continued proper maintenance of all landscaping materials and shall keep them
in a proper, neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris at all
times. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one year
or by the next planting period, whichever comes first. Other defective
landscape material shall be replaced or repaired within three months.
         B.   No required plantings shall be removed by the property owner or
agent of the owner unless the planting materials are found to be hazardous,
unhealthy, or dead by the City or its agents. If any healthy mature or
established plantings as required by this Zoning Code are removed at the
discretion of the owner or his or her agent they shall be replaced by the owner
with a similar sized planting to those that were removed to maintain a
consistent and mature appearance of plantings in that area.
      (5)   Preservation of existing landscape materials. Existing landscape
material shall be shown on the required landscape plan and any material in
satisfactory condition may be used to satisfy these requirements in whole or in
part when, in the opinion of the City's approval authority, such materials meet
the requirements and achieve the objectives of this chapter.
   (i)   Fencing and Walls.
      (1)   Purpose. Fences and walls can be used in conjunction with plant
material to provide visual breaks between properties, buffer various uses, and
enhance the character of a development.
      (2)   Applicability. These standards apply to all fences and walls
installed to meet the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Types.
         A.   Privacy fencing or walls (100 percent opacity from grade to six
feet) may be used as a screen between abutting commercial/industrial sites
         B.   Decorative or privacy fencing may be used as a screen between
commercial/ industrial sites and abutting residential sites if other
transitional methods cannot achieve the desired transitions.
         C.   Fences running parallel to a right-of-way in commercial areas
shall be forty or more transparent such as wrought iron or picket or post and
rail type fencing or less than forty inches in height.
         D.   All fences shall be designed or installed so that the finished
side of the fence faces out or towards the neighboring property.
      (4)   Permitted materials.
         A.   Walls shall be constructed of brick or stone (veneers are
permitted) to match the primary material of the primary building.
         B.   Permitted fence materials are wood, stone, wrought iron, brick,
vinyl and PVC (polyvinyl chloride). Wood fences shall be natural, painted, or
have a stain finish. Vinyl fence shall incorporate aluminum or galvanized steel
supports at the bottom. Vinyl fence shall have minimum thickness of .135 inches
(0.3 cm). The hardware shall be stainless steel or galvanized steel and have
concealed fasteners. The finished side of the fence shall face the adjacent
property or residential area. Post and rail, or other partially transparent
fencing may be used in conjunction with vegetative landscaping to create
definition to the site.
   (j)   Retention and Detention Basins.
      (1)   Purpose. Stormwater management facilities can be designed to
enhance the appearance of the City's nonresidential areas and add character and
attractive features to the areas.
      (2)   Applicability. While site topography and engineering standards
supersede aesthetics in the case of stormwater management, the aesthetics of
these facilities should be considered in site design for nonresidential
developments.
      (3)   Standards. The following standards should apply to the maximum
extent feasible based on individual site conditions:
         A.   Stormwater management basins located adjacent or near roadways
should be designed as retention ponds when possible to create visual interest
and identity for the roadway and subject developments.
         B.   Retention ponds shall be designed with the proper safety
constraints.
         C.   Ponds shall require aeration to prevent stagnant water and
fountains should be installed to maximize visual interest.
         D.   Retention ponds shall meet the minimum requirements of the City
Engineer.
         E.   Detention ponds shall be located away from roadways and public
view to the maximum extent feasible.
         F.   Dentition basins shall be seeded and maintained per the City
requirements.
         G.   Detention ponds shall meet the minimum requirements of the City
Engineer.
   (k)   Street Trees.
      (1)   Purpose. Street trees in the public right-of-way create a unified
appearance to major travel routes and contribute to an identity for the City.
      (2)   Applicability. Street trees shall be planted at regular intervals,
as specified along all public streets within the City right-of-way in
conjunction with all nonresidential development.
      (3)   Requirements. All street trees shall be planted or installed by
applicants in conformance with the following requirements:
         A.   No tree species as listed on the Undesirable Tree List shall be
planted as a street tree.
         B.   The minimum spacing required between trees is forty feet for
large and medium trees and thirty feet for small trees.
         C.   The maximum spacing for large trees shall be sixty feet on
center.
         D.   The minimum street tree setbacks shall be determined by the City
based on the growth characteristics of the proposed tree, the width of the
right-of-way in question, and the required visibility factors for the roadway
as determined by the City's engineer.
         E.   No tree shall be located closer than thirty feet from street
intersections or ten feet from fire hydrants and utility poles.
         F.   Small trees shall be used when planting under or within ten
lateral feet of overhead utility wires.
         G.   Owners/developers shall be required to maintain the trees for one
year after the trees are planted and to replace any tree which dies within that
one year guarantee period.
         H.   The minimum trunk caliper measured at five feet above the ground
for all street trees shall be two inches.
      (4)   Landscaping within right-of-way. The occasions when landscaping
within the City right-of-way is required for the owner/developer to achieve
minimum streetscape requirements, an encroachment agreement between the City
and landowner/developer shall be executed and recorded requiring the landowner/
developer to maintain the landscaping and waiving any City liability.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14; Ord. 2015-15. Passed 8-18-15.)
1300.09   SITE LIGHTING.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the lighting standards is to coordinate and
unify the overall lighting appearance of nonresidential developments with
regard to aesthetic and technical aspects. Site lighting components should be
visually interesting and serve not only to illuminate the parking and drive
areas, but also to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the site. Fixtures shall
be of a design complimentary to the intent of the Nonresidential Design
Standards.
   (b)   Applicability. All developments with ten or more parking spaces are
required to provide exterior lighting for all exterior doorways, pedestrian
pathways, and vehicular use areas. All developments with less than ten parking
spaces shall provide exterior lighting at all exterior doorways.
   (c)   Requirements. All exterior lighting shall meet the following standards
and shall be demonstrated on all plan submittals:
      (1)   Minimum illumination. A minimum illumination of 0.5 footcandles
shall be maintained when measured at grade in all vehicular use areas and
pedestrian pathways. Actual site measurement compliance shall not drop below
this minimum stated. For design purposes, the light loss factor (LLF) shall be
calculated to 0.8 LLF.
      (2)   Maximum illumination. Lighting uniformity shall not exceed 10:
1 maximum to minimum light levels and 4:1 average to minimum light levels. The
maximum foot-candle level shall be 10.0, with higher foot-candle levels
approved on a case-by-case basis per the latest Illumination Engineering
Society of North American Lighting Handbook.
      (3)   Maximum illumination at property lines. Light originating on a site
shall not trespass beyond the site to exceed the following values when measured
at grade ten feet beyond the property line for the following adjacent property
types:

         B.   Multi-family: 0.5 footcandles; and
         C.   Office/commercial/industrial: 1.0 footcandles.
      (4)   Maximum height. The height of the light pole shall be determined by
the size of the building as follows:
         A.   Lighting fixtures for buildings smaller than 15,000 square feet
shall not exceed the height of the building or twenty-five feet including the
base, whichever is less.
         B.   Lighting fixtures for buildings 15,000 square feet or larger
shall not exceed the height of the building or thirty-seven feet including
base, whichever is less.
      (5)   Fixture type.

except for industrial buildings shall be cut-off style of a traditional or
historic reproduction using a gooseneck style arm on decorative poles with a
clam shell base.
         B.   Light fixtures and poles for industrial buildings shall be
encouraged to be of a similar type as described above in A.; however, other
fixtures which are compatible with the architecture and scale of the building
and adjacent buildings and their fixtures may be considered by the City on a
case-by-case basis.
         C.   The style of the adjacent development's light fixture should be
taken into consideration on all nonresidential developments to promote
consistency throughout the City. (See Figure 44 for examples of preferred
types.)

1302.02   District boundaries.
1302.03   Permitted and conditional uses.
1302.04   District standards.
1302.01   PURPOSE.
   The old village section of Pickerington is a unique area comprised of
residences, neighborhood businesses serving the personal, family, and household
needs of residents and the community, and public and semipublic land uses.
These uses are contained in structures representing a variety of architectural
styles which reflect the era in which most of the village section was built.
The purpose of the Old Pickerington Village (OPV) Overlay District is to
recognize in these regulations the unique characteristics of the original
village in order to protect, re-establish, and retain the unique architectural,
site layout, and aesthetic characteristics of the district and the buildings
and sites within it, while facilitating their use in today's market. Olde
Pickerington is characterized by a mix of uses in close proximity, pedestrian-
oriented architecture and site design, reduced building setbacks, rear parking
lots, and a street system that incorporates alleys and smaller lot sizes. The
provisions of the OPV Overlay are intended to recognize, protect, and encourage
these distinctive features and design elements of the community and its
history. The maintenance and renovation of existing structures together with
the integration of new and expanded structures and sites that complement the
character of the District are emphasized in order to maintain and enhance the
Olde Pickerington Village.
(Ord. 2014-27. Passed 8-5-14.)

sign. The standard primary sign should be a wall sign above the storefront or a
monument sign in the front yard; and the standard secondary sign should be a
projecting sign for easy view of pedestrians along the sidewalk.
      (2)   Only one primary sign is permitted. The maximum number of business
name signs should be two per business on the front, or side, or combination, of
the building as well as one sign on the rear of the structure for those
structures backing on a public alley.

the individual building on which it resides. Signs shall not cover windows or
roof shapes, or dominate trim or extend above roof lines.

building. Simulated wood grain signs are encouraged for monument, wall, and
projecting signs. Materials to be avoided include non-durable materials like
plywood panels.
      (5)   Internally lighted signs are not permitted. Signs may be lighted
from exterior sources, provided the light source is cut-off so as to only
illuminate the sign face. Ground-mounted light sources must be screened from
public view, preferably with landscaping. Wall-mounted light sources should be
architecturally appropriate for the building.
      (6)   All other sign standards of these codified ordinances apply.

CHAPTER 1304
Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
1304.01   Purpose.
1304.02   Designation of electric vehicle charging stations.
1304.03   Where permitted.
1304.04   Standards for electric vehicle charging stations.
1304.05   Minimum parking requirements.
1304.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to develop a standard for the installation of
electric vehicle charging stations. Where any other provisions of the
Pickerington Codified Ordinances directly conflict with this chapter, this
chapter shall control.
(Ord. 2021-23. Passed 10-5-21.)
1304.02 DESIGNATION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS.
   An electric vehicle charging station is a public or private parking space(s)
that is (are) served by battery charging equipment with the purpose of
transferring electric energy to a battery or other energy storage device in an
electric vehicle and is classified based on the following levels:
   (a)   Level 1 is considered slow charging and operates on a 15 to 20 amp
breaker on a 120 volt AC circuit.
   (b)   Level 2 is considered medium charging and operated on a 40 to 100 amp
breaker on a 208 or 240 volt AC circuit.
   (c)   Level 3 is considered fast or rapid charging and operated on a 60 amp
or higher breaker on a 480 volt or higher three phase circuit with special
grounding equipment. Level 3 stations can also be referred to as rapid charging
stations that are typically characterized by industrial grade electrical
outlets that allow for faster recharging of electric vehicles.
(Ord. 2021-23. Passed 10-5-21.)
1304.03 WHERE PERMITTED.
   (a)   Level 1 and 2 electric vehicle charging stations are a permitted use
in all zoning districts.
   (b)   Level 3 electric vehicle charging stations are a permitted use in C3
and C4 Districts, but require a conditional use permit in all other zoning
districts.
      (1)   A conditional use permit will be issued for a Level 3 electric
vehicle charging station when it complies with the regulations of the district
in which it is located and also with the provisions of
Chapter 1272 and
Chapter 1286, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and also
with the criteria listed below:
         A.   Whether there is adequate landscaping or other buffer around the
charging station.
         B.   Whether there are limitations on the hours of operation of the
charging station.
         C.   Whether the charging station will create an undue burden on
public facilities and services, such as streets, utilities, or schools.
         D.   Whether the charging station, either due to appearance, noise,
pollution, traffic, or any other condition, will detrimental to existing and
future neighboring uses, and will involve a use, structure, or condition of
operation that constitutes a nuisance or hazard to any persons or property.
   (c)   Battery exchange stations are permitted in C3 and C4 Districts, but
require a conditional use permit in all other zoning districts.
(Ord. 2021-23. Passed 10-5-21.)
1304.04 STANDARDS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS.
   Electric vehicle charging stations utilizing parking stalls located in a
parking lot or parking garage or in on-street parking spaces shall comply with
the standards in this section. Because the technology associated with electric
vehicles, batteries and electric vehicle charging stations is relatively new
and is anticipated to change, and that there is a lack of municipal experience
on consumer and community preferences and attitudes with regard to electric
vehicles, the Planning Director may authorize variations from these standards,
so long as the intent and goal of the standards and this chapter are addressed.
   (a)   Except when located in conjunction with single-family residences,
electric vehicle charging stations shall be reserved for parking and charging
of electric vehicles only.
   (b)   Signage. Each electric vehicle charging station shall be posted with
signage indicating the space is only for electric vehicle charging purposes.
Signage shall include items contained in subsection (f) of this section.
Wayfinding signs conveniently located to guide motorists to the charging
stations are permitted with approval of the Planning Department.
   (c)   Accessibility. The design and location of the electric vehicle
charging stations shall comply with the following barrier-free accessibility
requirements:
      (1)   Accessible vehicle charging stations shall be provided based on the
following table:
 
Number of EV Charging Stations Minimum Accessible EV Charging Stations
3 - 50                         1
51 - 100                       2
 
      (2)   Accessible charging stations shall be located in proximity to the
buildings or facility entrances and shall be connected to a barrier-free
accessible route of travel.
      (3)   Accessible charging stations shall comply with all state and
federal requirements.
   (d)   Lighting. Adequate site lighting shall be provided, which shall also
comply with all other relevant Chapters of this Code.
   (e)   Equipment. Equipment for electric vehicle charging stations shall
comply with the following standards:
      (1)   Equipment mounted on pedestals, lighting posts, bollards, or other
devices for on-street charging station shall be designed and located as to not
impede pedestrian travel or create trip hazards within the right-of-way.
      (2)   Charging station outlets and connector shall be no less than 36
inches or no higher than 48 inches from the top of the surface where mounted
and shall contain a retraction device or a place to hang cords and connectors
above the ground surface.
      (3)   Equipment shall be protected by wheel stops or concrete-filled
bollards.
   (f)   Notification. The following information shall be posted at all
electric vehicle charging stations:
      (1)   Voltage and amperage levels;
      (2)   Hour of operations if time limits or tow-away provisions are to be
enforced by the property owner;
      (3)   Usage fees;
      (4)   Safety information;
      (5)   Contact information for reporting when the equipment is not
operating or other problems.
(Ord. 2021-23. Passed 10-5-21.)
1304.05 MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   Electric vehicle charging stations located within parking lots or garages
may be included in the calculation of the minimum required parking spaces
required pursuant to the development standards.

Relations, and as published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio Administrative Code
(OAC), including any amendments, deletions, or future additions published
thereafter and including all other Codes adopted by reference herein.
(Ord. 2003-04. Passed 3-4-03; Ord. 2011-09. Passed 3-15-11.)
1420.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the OBC, as adopted in Section
1420.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including

1446.02 PURPOSE; SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation,
planning, management and administration of the use or occupation of all rights-
of-way in the City, the issuance of right-of-way permits to persons for such
use or occupancy and to set forth the policies of the City relating thereto.
   (b)   A right-of-way permit issued pursuant to this chapter does not take
the place of any service permit, franchise, license, or permit which may be
additionally required by law, including any required by these Codified
Ordinances. Each permittee shall obtain any and all such additional State,
Federal or City franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the operation and
conduct of its business or the occupation or use of any right-of-way, provided,
however, that no permittee holding a valid right-of-way permit shall be
required to obtain a service permit for any type of services rendered by said
permittee for which the City did not require service permits at the time said
permittee's permit was last issued or renewed. Should there be a direct
conflict between the provisions of this chapter and a valid service permit, the
provisions of the service permit shall prevail, provided, however, that
additional obligations shall not be construed as a conflict.
   (c)   The City Manager is hereby directed and empowered to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   The City's policy regarding rights-of-way is to promote the
utilization of rights-of-way for the public health, safety and welfare and to
promote economic development in the City including, but not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
communications and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technology and innovative services, to the City's residents and taxpayers at
reasonable costs;
      (2)   To promote cooperation among the permittees and the City in the
occupation of rights-of-way, or work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during right-of-way work, and ensure safe and efficient use of
the City's streets, rights-of-way, and easements, and eliminate wasteful,
unnecessary or unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (3)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (4)   To ensure adequate public compensation for private use of the
rights-of-way and the costs related thereto, including the regulation thereof;
      (5)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
rights-of-way, and when all requests for right-of-way use cannot be
accomplished, to give priority for use of rights-of-way, in the order
indicated, from highest to lowest, to the following users:
         A.   The City for governmental purposes;
         B.   Another governmental entity for governmental purposes with the
City's concurrence, or other governmental use required by law;
         C.   General right-of-way permittees and proprietary uses by the City;
         D.   Special right-of-way permittees, provided, however, that the City
Manager may reasonably require cooperation and accommodation among permittees
in the public interest.
   (e)   All right-of-way permits granted hereunder shall be nonexclusive and
no property
right of any nature shall be created by the granting of a permit under this
chapter.
   (f)   This chapter does not apply, and nothing herein should be construed to
apply the provisions of this chapter, to structures or facilities owned or
operated by the City or any City operations that occupy or use the rights-of-
way. It is specifically contemplated, however, that all City departments or
divisions that utilize the rights-of-way shall carry out their operations in a
manner consistent with the policy set forth in this chapter, including
participation and cooperation in all joint planning hereunder and the
identification of structures and facilities located in the rights-of-way.
   (g)   Applicants shall have the financial, technical and managerial
resources to comply with this chapter and the provisions of any right-of-way
permit issued hereunder, provided that, for purposes of this chapter, an
applicant possessing valid authorization from the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio, including certification pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4933.81 et seq., for the
services to be provided by the facilities subject to this chapter, shall be
presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial
resources, unless otherwise shown by clear and convincing evidence.
(Ord. 99-64. Passed 9-7-99.)
1446.03 PERMIT REQUIRED; TYPES; PERMIT NONTRANSFERABLE.
   (a)   Unless permitted by these Codified Ordinances, no person shall use,
occupy, construct, own or operate structures or facilities in, under or over

amount of time is requested within the application.
         B.   Cable television or other services that are covered by an

the application for the permit.
      (2)   Special right-of-way permits. Granted to persons for a specific,
limited use of the rights-of-way or a specific portion thereof as further

way permits may be granted for any amount of right-of-way to agencies of the
government of the United States, the State of Ohio, or its political
subdivisions, for governmental purposes. Said permits shall be available in the
following two categories:
         A.   Special right-of-way permit for non-residential purposes. Granted
to an individual or business seeking to place facilities and/or enhancements
within the public rights-of-way for public or private business purposes. Said
use shall be limited to one linear mile of public right-of-way. This type of
permit shall be issued for all qualifying governmental purposes as defined in

   (c)   Any such right-of-way permit may also allow the use of specified

transferee possesses valid authorization from the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio, including certification pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4933.81 et seq., for the
services to be provided by the facilities subject to this chapter, unless
otherwise shown by clear and convincing evidence. Unless otherwise provided in
a permit, the permittee shall reimburse the City for all direct and indirect
fees, costs, and expenses reasonably incurred by the City in considering a
request to transfer or assign a permit. Any transfer or assignment of a permit
without prior approval of the City or its designee shall be null and void and
is cause for revocation of the permit.
      (1)   All requests for transfer shall be deemed approved if the City
Manager does not disapprove the same within thirty days of receipt of the
completed written transfer request.
      (2)   The transfer to affiliates under common ownership and control with
the permittee shall not require approval, so long as the City Manager is
provided thirty days written notice of such transfer.

provided, however, that such right-of-way permit shall only relate to and
entitle the permittee to utilize the rights-of-way, in accordance with this
chapter, for purposes directly relating to the provision of the specific

pursuant to subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   All other applications for general right-of-way permits, or amendments
or renewals thereof, shall be filed in such form and in such manner as required

permit, subject to any appropriate terms and conditions, in accordance with the
criteria set forth in this chapter. The Director's report shall be served upon
the applicant by mail, along with a notice of when the City Manager will
consider the same. The City Manager shall then consider such recommendation and
make a final determination, in writing, within forty-five days of the
Director's report, as to whether or not such right-of-way permit should be
granted and, if so, upon what terms and conditions. The term of each such
general right-of-way permit shall in no event exceed ten years from the date of
issuance or such lesser term as the applicant requests.
   (c)   An application for a special right-of-way permit, or amendments or

right-of-way permit for residential purposes, or (2) five hundred dollars
($500.00) for a special right-of-way permit for non-residential purposes. If
the Director determines that the application is in order and that the criteria
set forth in Section
1446.05 have been met, and that the application should be granted, the Director
shall, within forty-five days of receipt of a completed application,
conditionally grant or renew such a right-of-way permit subject to any
appropriate terms and conditions or deny the same. The Director's conditional
grant, renewal or denial shall be served upon the applicant by mail. Such
conditional denial, grant or renewal shall become final unless modified or
rejected by the City Manager within thirty days of issuance by the Director, or
unless appealed pursuant to subsection (g) hereof. The term of such special
right-of-way permit shall be three years from issuance, or such lesser term as
the applicant requests.
      A special right-of-way permit for residential purposes may be granted for
an indefinite term from issuance, but may be canceled by the City Manager with
sixty days written notice. Should the City Manager find that an emergency
exists, the City Manager may cancel said permit within a lesser time period.
   (d)   Following receipt of a right-of-way permit application, the Director
shall review said application for conformance with the provisions of this
chapter as outlined in subsections (f) and (h) hereof. If the application
should be determined to be incomplete, the Director shall promptly notify the
applicant of any and all information required. Further processing will be
delayed until all such additional information has been received by the
Director. Following the approval of the Director, the applicant shall be
notified in writing of the approval of the City Manager by the City Manager

single point of contact. The applicant must then conform to the provisions of
the permit and the provisions of this chapter as outlined in subsections (f)
and (h) hereof. Any such payment amounts must be received by the City in order
to validate the permit.
   (e)   A permittee shall file an application to renew its permit not more
than 180 days nor less than ninety days prior to the expiration of its current
permit. The application shall be filed in a form required by the City and shall

      The Director shall determine if the application for permit renewal is in
order and shall, within forty-five days of the receipt of a completed
application, issue a written report regarding such application. The report
shall recommend that the City Manager deny or grant the right-of-way permit,
subject to any appropriate terms and conditions, in accordance with the
criteria set forth in this chapter. The Director's report shall be served upon
the applicant by mail, along with a notice of when the City Manager will
consider the same. The City Manager shall then consider such recommendation and
make a final determination in writing, within thirty days of the Director's
report, as to whether or not such right-of-way permit should be granted and, if
so, upon what terms and conditions.
      No permit shall be renewed until any present or ongoing violations or
defaults in the permittee's performance of the existing permit, or of the
requirements of this chapter, have been cured, or until a plan detailing

      (8)   Identify their facilities in the rights-of-way whenever permittees
are notified by the City that the City has determined that such identification

existing general right-of-way permittees and permit applicants shall provide
with their application a schematic drawing, in a form acceptable to the City,
of their proposed facilities and an inventory of existing facilities relating

City involving the installation or replacement of equipment may designate the
proper corridor for location of the equipment in question.
      (1)   Any permittee whose facilities are in the right-of-way and are in a
position at variance with the established utility corridors established by the
City Manager shall at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the
area, excluding normal maintenance activities, move such equipment to its
assigned position within the rights-of-way. This requirement may be waived by

accommodate all of the requests of the permittees, the City Manager shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the rights-of-way. The City Manager shall make every good-faith attempt
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way as set

facilities underground within a certain area of the City, every permittee with
facilities within the same area of the City shall concurrently relocate their
facilities underground.
   (e)   Unless otherwise determined by the City Manager, pursuant to this
chapter, permittees shall cooperate with owners and developers of private
property adjacent to the rights-of-way in the construction of private turn
lanes, driveway approaches, roadway widening or other improvements which may
require the permittee to remove or relocate its facilities, provided, however,
that the permittee's expenses have been reasonably secured by the owner or
developer who initiated said removal or relocation.
   (f)   Owners of facilities, poles, conduits, vaults and other structures
that are located within the rights-of-way of the City shall have the
responsibility for removal or relocation of such facilities whenever required
and shall coordinate the removal or relocation with any other permittee who has
facilities attached to or enclosed within the owner's facilities. Permittees
neglecting or refusing to cooperate with the facility owner in a timely fashion
concerning said removal or relocation of facilities shall be deemed to be in
violation of paragraph (a)(4) hereof.
   (g)   Each permittee shall immediately notify the City of any emergency
situation that involves its facilities and that will require excavation and/or
occupancy of the right-of-way. The permittee may proceed with whatever actions
it deems necessary to respond to the emergency. Upon securing the site in
question from imminent danger, all other provisions of this chapter and any
rules and regulations related thereto shall apply.
      (1)   To the reasonable extent that the City becomes aware of an
emergency regarding a permittee's facilities within the right-of-way, the City
shall attempt to contact the local representative of each permittee known by
the City to be affected by the situation. In doing so, the City will use the
twenty-four hour emergency number(s) provided by each permittee. However, the
City cannot and does not insure that every such contact will be made in every
such instance.
      (2)   Should the permittee's facilities create or contribute to an
imminent danger to health, safety or property, the City may take such
necessary, temporary steps as are required to protect the public safety.
   (h)   Within fourteen calendar days notice, a permittee shall remove any and
all graffiti on any of the permittee's facilities located within the City
rights-of-way. Should the permittee fail to do so, the City may take whatever
action is necessary to remove the graffiti and bill the permittee for the cost
thereof.

objections to the proposed regulations within a thirty-day period after such
publication (hereinafter "comment period"). The proposed regulations shall

1466.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of Pickerington, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Pickerington, herein referred to as the City, has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood- prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1466.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   “Flood Insurance Study, Fairfield County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas,” dated January 6, 2012.
   (b)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map, Fairfield County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas”, dated January 6, 2012.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by Section
1466.28 Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   (d)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Floodplain Administrator's Office,
Pickerington City Hall, 100 Lockville Road, Pickerington, Ohio.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances,
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed,
restriction, covenant or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure.” A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.” See “Lowest floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).” The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.” A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “flooding.” A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).” Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones.” Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      Zone A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.

flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE).” The base flood elevation plus one
and one-half feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist
from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National
Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an enclosure
below the lowest floor which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in O.A.C. 3701-27-01, any tract
of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City's Flood Insurance
Rate Map, October 2, 1987, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An “agency” is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is: (1) built on a single
chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a
light-duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 through
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.” Also known as “area of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. “Special flood hazard areas” are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as

   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1466.34 through
1466.38, Appeals and Variances.

elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.23 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1466.33(a)(2)A. and C. through E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a

portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.

1466.37 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Flood Damage Control Board shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (I)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought, shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Flood Damage Control Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Pickerington.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Flood Damage Control Board shall
schedule and hold a public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of
general circulation in the community at least ten days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Flood Damage Control Board requires. In
considering such variance applications, the Flood Damage Control Board shall
consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the following
factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Flood Damage Control Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
   (e)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1466.37(c)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)
1466.38 APPEAL TO THE COURT.
   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Flood Damage Control Board may appeal

regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations,
unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in

amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1466.99.
(Ord. 2011-60. Passed 11-15-11.)

If the Commission determines that no architectural or environmental feature is
involved, the Director of Planning and Zoning shall issue a certificate of
appropriateness without a formal hearing.

taken on the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness in cases
involving the demolition of a listed property within any Historic District.
During such waiting period, the Commission or its designee shall negotiate with
the owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable
to both. The first meeting between the Commission and the owner shall take
place within thirty days from the date of denial of the certificate of
appropriateness, and both parties must continue to have good faith meetings at
least every forty-five days after the initial meeting. If a compromise proposal
is accepted by both parties, then the Commission may cause a certificate of
appropriateness to be issued.
   (h)   Conflicts Between Standards. In the case of a conflict between any of
the standards provided for in this chapter and the Standards for Rehabilitation
of the Secretary of Interior, the Standards for Rehabilitation shall prevail.

   (a)   In General. The Building Department Representative must notify the
applicant of the applicable impact fee requirements, including applicable
service charges, at the time of application for a building permit on a form
provided by the City for such purposes. The Building Department Representative
must calculate the applicable impact fee at the time of application for a
building permit. The City may not issue a building permit until the applicant
has paid all impact fees due pursuant to this chapter.
   (b)   Calculation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the City
Manager must determine: (a) whether the proposed new development constitutes a
residential or nonresidential use; (b) the specific category of residential or
nonresidential development; and (c) the amount of additional square feet of
nonresidential gross floor area or the number of additional dwelling units
associated with the proposed use.
      (2)   If the application for a building permit involves a change in use,
the impact fee due must be based on the incremental increase in the fee for the
increase in the public facility capacity created by the proposed change in use.
      (3)   After making these determinations, the City Manager must calculate
the applicable impact fee by multiplying the number of dwelling units or amount
of nonresidential floor area proposed by the amount of the applicable impact
fee per unit of development, incorporating any applicable exemptions or
credits.
      (4)   If the type of land use proposed for new development is not
expressly listed in the particular impact fee ordinance and schedule, the City
Manager, in consultation with other City staff and consultants, as necessary,
must:
         A.   Identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the
impact fee based on the impact fee for the land use identified;
         B.   Identify the broader land use category within which the specified
land use would apply and calculate the impact fee based on the impact fee for
that land use category; or
         C.   As appropriate, determine the basis used to calculate the fee
pursuant to an independent impact analysis pursuant to subsection (c) below.
      (5)   The City Manager's determination must be based on a generally-
accepted land use classification system (e.g., the North American Industry
Classification System, the Land-Based Classification Standards, and/or ITE’s
Trip Generation Manual) and the methodology report.
      (6)   The calculation of impact fees due from a multiple-use new
development must reflect the aggregated demand for each public facility
generated by each land use type within the proposed new development.
      (7)   The calculation of impact fees due from a phased new development
must reflect the demand generated by each specific land use within the phase of
development for which a separate building permit is requested.
      (8)   Impact fees must be calculated based on the impact fee amount in
effect at the time of application for a building permit.
   (c)   Independent Impact Analysis. If the applicant believes that the impact
fee calculations are in error or would violate a right that is protected by the
State or Federal constitution, the applicant may conduct an impact fee
analysis. The following provisions shall apply to any independent impact
analysis:
      (1)   The applicant is responsible, at its sole expense, for preparing
the independent impact analysis, which must be reviewed for approval by the
City Manager, and, as appropriate, other City staff or officials, prior to
payment of the fee.
      (2)   The independent impact analysis must measure the impact that the
proposed new development will have on the particular public facility at issue,
must be based on the same methodologies used in the methodology report, and
must be supported by professionally acceptable data and assumptions.
      (3)   Within 30 days of submittal of the independent impact analysis, the
City Manager must provide written notice to the applicant as to whether the
analysis is accepted or rejected based on the provisions of this section. If
the independent impact analysis is rejected, the written notice must provide an
explanation of the insufficiencies of the analysis.
      (4)   The final decision of the City Manager may be appealed pursuant to
Section
1486.06 of this chapter.
   (d)   Non-binding Impact Fee Estimate. An applicant may request a non-
binding estimate of impact fees due for a particular new development at any
time by filing a request on a form provided for such purpose by the City;
provided, however, that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal
application for a building permit for new development is made. Such non-binding
estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant and in no way
binds the City or precludes it from making amendments or revisions to any
provisions of this chapter or the specific impact fee implementing ordinances.
No vested rights, legal entitlements, or equitable estoppel accrue by reason of
a non-binding estimate. A non-binding fee estimate does not constitute a final
decision and may not be appealed pursuant to Section
1486.06.
   (e)   Reimbursements and Credits.
      (1)   Eligibility for a reimbursement. The City Council may enter into a
development agreement with an applicant, which provides for the reimbursement
of impact fees in exchange for the dedication or construction of public
facilities made necessary by a proposed new development. The City may reimburse
impact fees already paid only for the type of facility dedicated or constructed
by the applicant. Reimbursements must be made from the impact fee account
earmarked for the same type of public facility being dedicated or constructed.
No impact fees may be reimbursed for a proffered public facility unless:
         A.   It is included in the City's capital budget, capital improvement
plan, or the methodology report; or
         B.   It adds public facility capacity made necessary by and to be
provided for the roughly proportionate benefit of new development.
      (2)   Additional provisions.
         A.   In order to be eligible for a reimbursement, the applicant must
receive approval by the City Council pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, prior to the issuance of a building permit.
         B.   The City may not reimburse the applicant in an amount exceeding
the amount of the impact fee due pursuant to this chapter.
         C.   The City may not reimburse the applicant until a proffered land
dedication is finalized or the construction project is at least 50% complete.
Reimbursement may then occur based on the percent completion of the project.
         D.   If an applicant proposes to dedicate or construct public
facilities valued at an amount greater than the amount of the impact fee due,
then the development agreement may provide for reimbursements to the applicant
by future developers of costs incurred over and above those reimbursed by the
City.
      (3)   Procedures for reimbursements.
         A.   Application made to the City Manager. Applications for an
agreement by the City to provide a reimbursement upon completion of certain
work by the applicant must be made on a form provided by the City Manager for
such purposes. The application must be accompanied by a proposed development
agreement developed through coordination with City staff. Upon receipt of a
complete application and proposed development agreement, the City Manager, City
Attorney, and other appropriate staff and/or consultants must review the
application and proposed development agreement, as well as such other
information and evidence as may be deemed relevant, and the City Manager must
forward a recommendation report stating whether in the opinion of the City
Manager a reimbursement is proper based on the provisions of this chapter to
the Planning and Zoning Commission. In the instances where a proposed
development agreement exists, the City Manager's recommendation report shall be
based on the assumption that upon completion of the work by the applicant as
set forth within the proposed development agreement the same will comply in all
material ways with the proposed development agreement and City standards.
         B.   Recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Based on
the report of the City Manager, the provisions of this chapter, the capital
improvement plan, the comprehensive plan, adopted City Budget, and the
methodology report, the Planning and Zoning Commission must recommend to the
City Council to accept, reject, or accept with conditions the proposed
reimbursement and proposed development agreement.
         C.   City Council. Based on the recommendation report of the City
Manager, the provisions of this chapter, the capital improvement plan,
comprehensive plan, adopted City budget, the methodology report, and the
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, City Council must make a
final decision to accept, reject, or accept with conditions the proposed
reimbursement and proposed development agreement. In instances where a proposed
development agreement exists, the Planning and Zoning Commission's
recommendation shall be based on the assumption that upon completion of the
work by the applicant as set forth within the proposed development agreement
the same will comply in all material ways with the proposed development
agreement and City standards.
         D.   Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of the City Council may
be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Fairfield County.
      (4)   Calculation of the value of dedication or construction. The amount
of the reimbursement to be paid by the City is to be calculated as follows:
         A.   Construction of facilities and provision of equipment. The
reimbursement must be equal to the actual cost of construction or equipment as
evidenced by receipts and other sufficient documentation or the amount of
impact fees due pursuant to this chapter, whichever is less.
         B.   Dedication of land. At the option of the applicant, the
reimbursement is to be based on either the assessed value of the proffered
land, based on the most recent County property appraisal, or the fair market
value of the land as determined by a certified property appraiser hired and
paid for by the applicant. If the latter option is chosen and the City rejects
the applicant's appraisal, the City may hire and pay for a second appraiser to
appraise the property. If either party rejects the second appraisal, a third
appraisal may be performed by an appraiser chosen by the first and second
appraisers, the costs of which are to be shared equally by the City and the
applicant. The third appraisal is binding on both parties. All appraisals must
be consistent with generally-accepted appraisal techniques and the date of
valuation must be the date of transfer to the City.
      (5)   Development agreement requirements. No reimbursement may be made
except pursuant to an executed development agreement between the City and the
applicant, which must include, but is not necessarily limited to; the
following:
         A.   The estimated cost of the public facility to be constructed or
dedicated, based on the provisions of this chapter;
         B.   A schedule for the initiation and completion of the construction
of a public facility;
         C.   The amount of the impact fees, by type, to be reimbursed by the
City to the applicant;
         D.   The schedule for making reimbursement payments to the applicant,
based on the provisions of this section;
         E.   Provision for reimbursements to the applicant by future
developers of costs incurred over and above those reimbursed by the City
pursuant to this section;
         F.   The applicant's agreement to construct all public facilities in
accordance with City specifications and all regulations set forth in the
Codified Ordinances; and
         G.   Such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the City.
      (6)   Transfer and assignment. The reimbursement may be paid only to the
original applicant or the applicant's legal successor in interest with a
contractual right to the reimbursement. Any transfer or assignment is valid
only if the applicant gives the City Council written notice in advance of the
transfer.
      (7)   Eligibility for credits for excessive dedication or construction.
An applicant may be given a credit against an impact fee upon demonstration
that, after the date of this chapter, a public facility was dedicated or
constructed by the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in interest with
sufficient excess capacity to offset the impacts of the applicant's proposed
new development. In order for a credit to be accepted, the applicant must
demonstrate that the dedicated or constructed public facility will reduce the
overall need for public facilities and that the applicant has secured a
contractual right to an allocation of the excess capacity equal to the total or
any portion of the impact fee owed by the applicant. Any approved credit must
be consistent with the adopted City budget, capital improvement plan,
comprehensive plan, and the methodology report.
      (8)   Procedures for credits.
         A.   Application made to the City Manager. Applications for a credit
must be made on a form provided by the City for such purposes. The application
must be accompanied by a development agreement executed after the effective
date of this chapter, which demonstrates that excess public facility capacity
has been provided by the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in interest,
which will provide a roughly proportionate benefit to the new development
proposed by the applicant. Upon receipt of a complete application, the City
Manager, City Attorney and other appropriate staff and/or consultants must
review the application, as well as such other information and evidence as may
be deemed relevant. The City Manager must determine whether a credit is proper
based on the provisions of this chapter, the capital improvement plan, the
comprehensive plan, the methodology report, and/or other relevant evidence. In
instances where a development agreement exists, the City Manager's
recommendation shall be based on a determination as to whether or not the work
as completed by the applicant complies in all material ways with the
development agreement and City standards.
         B.   Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of the City Manager may
be made to the City Council pursuant to Section
1486.06.
   (f)   Collection. The City Manager must collect all impact fees and service
charges in the amounts set forth in this chapter at the time of issuance of a
building permit and must issue a receipt to the applicant for such payment
unless:
      (1)   The applicant is not subject to the payment of a impact fee; or
      (2)   The applicant has filed an appeal as required by Section
1486.06 and has filed a bond or other surety in the amount of the impact fee as
calculated by the City Manager and approved by the City Attorney and City
Manager.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 8-21-07.)
1486.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF IMPACT FEE ACCOUNTS; USE AND APPROPRIATION OF IMPACT
FEE FUNDS; AND REFUNDS.
   (a)   Impact fee Accounts. The City Manager must establish an impact fee
account for each category of public facility for which impact fees are imposed.
Such account must identify clearly the public facility for which the impact fee
has been imposed. All impact fees collected by the City must be deposited into
the appropriate impact fee account. All interest earned on monies deposited
into a particular impact fee account must be credited to and considered funds
of that account. The funds of each such account must be capable of being
accounted for separately from all other City funds. The City Manager must
establish and implement necessary accounting controls to ensure that the impact
fee funds are properly deposited, accounted for, and appropriated in accordance
with this chapter and other applicable legal requirements.
   (b)   Use of Impact Fee Funds.
      (1)   Generally. All appropriations from impact fee accounts must be
approved by the City Council and detailed on a form provided for such purposes
and filed with the City Manager.
      (2)   Use of funds. Development impact fee funds may be used only for:
         A.   Public facility expenditures;
         B.   The payment of principal, interest, and other financing costs on
contracts, bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the
City to finance public facilities;
         C.   Financing of refunds as set forth in Section
1486.05(d);
         D.   Financing of reimbursements as set forth in Section
1486.04(e); or
         E.   Financing the costs of updating this chapter.
      (3)   Report. Consistent with Section
1486.05(c), prior to appropriating impact fee funds, the City Manager must
generate a written report which demonstrates that such funds are being used to
finance public facility capacity that provides or will provide benefits to new
development that are roughly proportionate to the impact of that development.
The report must be consistent with the methodology report. The written report
must be presented to and accepted by the City Council.
      (4)   Restrictions on use. Development impact fees may not be
appropriated for repair or maintenance of public facilities, or for operational
or personnel expenses associated with the provision of public facilities.
Additionally, impact fees must be appropriated:
         A.   For the particular public facility for which they were imposed,
calculated, and collected; and
         B.   Within six years of the beginning of the City's fiscal year
immediately succeeding the date of collection, unless such time period is
extended as provided in paragraph (b)(5), below.
      (5)   Appropriation of impact fee funds beyond six years of collection.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) below, impact fee funds may be
appropriated beyond six years from the beginning of the City's fiscal year
immediately succeeding the date of collection, if the appropriation is for a
public facility that requires more than six years to plan, design, and
construct. The City must document compliance with the provisions of this
paragraph.
   (c)   Procedure for Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds.
      (1)   Each year the City Council must identify public facility capacity
anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with impact fees. Public facility
expenditures must be consistent with the methodology report, the capital
improvement plan, the comprehensive plan, and the annual review described in
Section
1486.07, and such other information as may be relevant to ensure compliance
with this chapter.
      (2)   The City Council may include public facilities funded with impact
fees in the City's annual budget or capital improvements plan. If included, the
description of the public facility must specify the nature of the public
facility, the location of the public facility, the capacity to be added and/or
funded by the appropriation, the service area of the public facility, the need/
demand for the public facility, and the anticipated timing of completion of the
public facility.
      (3)   Consistent with the provisions of this chapter, the City Council
may authorize public facilities expenditures at such other times as it deems
necessary.
      (4)   The City Council must verify that adequate impact fee funds are or
will be available from the appropriate impact fee account for the particular
public facility capacity to be funded with impact fees.
      (5)   Impact fee funds must be spent on a first in/first out basis.
   (d)   Refunds.
      (1)   Eligibility.
         A.   Expiration or revocation of building permit. An applicant who has
paid an impact fee for a new development for which construction has not begun,
and the necessary building permit has expired or has been revoked, may apply
for a refund of impact fees paid. Refunds must be to the initial applicant who
paid the impact fee. The refund application must be made on a form provided by
the City for such purposes.
         B.   Failure of City to appropriate impact fee funds within time
limit. A current property owner may apply for a refund of impact fees paid by
an applicant if the City has failed to appropriate the impact fees collected
from the applicant within the time limit established in subsection (b)(4)
above. Refunds made pursuant to this paragraph must be to current property
owner. The refund application must be made on a form provided by the City for
such purposes.
         C.   Abandonment of new development. An applicant who has paid an
impact fee for a new development for which a building permit has been issued
and pursuant to which construction has been initiated but abandoned prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, is eligible for a refund if the
uncompleted building is completely demolished.
      (2)   Administrative fee. The City may deduct a two hundred dollar
($200.00) administrative fee from the amount of any refund granted and retain
the administrative fee in the appropriate impact fee account to defray the
administrative expenses associated with processing a refund application.
      (3)   Processing of applications for a refund.
         A.   Application made to the City Manager. Applications for a refund
must be made on a form provided by the City Manager for such purposes. Upon
receipt of a complete application for a refund, the City Manager must review
the application and documentary evidence submitted by the applicant, as well as
such other information and evidence as may be deemed relevant, and must forward
a report as to whether a refund is due based on the provisions of this chapter
to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         B.   Recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Based on
the report of the City Manager, the provisions of this chapter, and the
methodology report, the Planning and Zoning Commission must recommend to the
City Council to approve, deny, or approve with conditions the proposed refund.
         C.   City Council. Based on the report of the City Manager, the
provisions of this chapter, and the methodology report, and the recommendation
of the Planning and Zoning Commission, City Council must make a final decision
to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed refund and
appropriation.
         D.   Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of the City Council may
be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Fairfield County.
      (4)   Due to expiration or revocation. Applications for refunds due to
expiration or revocation of a building permit must be made on forms provided by
the City for such purposes and made within 60 days following expiration or
revocation of the building permit. In order for the refund application to be
deemed complete, the applicant must submit: (a) evidence that the person
applying for the refund was the initial applicant who paid the fee, or the
authorized agent of the initial applicant; (b) the amount of the impact fees
paid by public facility category and receipts evidencing such payments; and (c)
documentation evidencing the expiration or revocation of the building permit.
Failure to apply for a refund within 60 days following expiration or revocation
of the building permit constitutes a waiver of entitlement to a refund. No
interest must be paid by the City in calculating the amount of a refund
pursuant to this paragraph.
      (5)   Due to timeliness. Applications for refunds due to the failure of
the City to appropriate impact fees collected from the applicant within the
time limits established in subsection (b)(2) above must be made on forms
provided by the City Manager and must be made within one year following the
expiration of such time limit. In order for the refund application to be deemed
complete, the applicant must submit:
         A.   Evidence that the applicant is the current property owner or the
authorized agent of the current property owner;
         B.   The amount of the impact fees paid by public facility category
and receipts evidencing such payments; and
         C.   A description and documentation of the City's failure to
appropriate impact fee funds pursuant to subsection (b)(2) above. Interest must
be paid by the City in calculating the amount of the refunds pursuant to this
section.
      (6)   Due to abandonment. Applications for refunds due to abandonment of
a new development prior to completion must be on a form provided by the City
Manager for such purposes. Failure to apply for a refund within 60 days
following expiration or revocation of the building permit or demolition of the
structure constitutes a waiver of entitlement to a refund. No interest must be
paid by the City in calculating the amount of the refund pursuant to this
paragraph. The application must include:
         A.   Evidence that the person applying for the refund is the initial
applicant who paid the fee, or the authorized agent of the initial applicant;
         B.   The amount of the impact fees paid by public facility category
and receipts evidencing such payments; and
         C.   Documentation evidencing the demolition of the building partially
constructed pursuant to payment of the impact fees to be refunded.

   (b)   Annual Adjustments.
      (1)   On July 1, 2006, and on July 1 of each year thereafter, the amount
of any impact fee may be adjusted without further action by the City Council to
reflect inflationary increases in the cost of providing public facilities. The
City Manager must base any adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph on the
most recent 20-City annual national average data from the Engineering News
Record Construction Cost Index. Any adjustment based on other information or
adjustments in excess of documented inflationary costs may be made only
pursuant to City Council action.
      (2)   The City Manager may make the automatic annual adjustment unless
the City Council, in its review, determines an alternate adjustment is
appropriate.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 8-21-07.)
1486.08 EXEMPTIONS; WAIVERS.
   (a)   Exemption /Waiver Process.
      (1)   The City Council may exempt all or part of particular development
projects from development impact fees if such projects are determined to create
extraordinary economic development and/or employment growth.
      (2)   Filing of application and review process. Petitions for exemptions
to the application of the provisions of this chapter or waivers from specific
impact fees shall be filed with the City Manager on forms provided by the City.
The City Manager or his or her designee, shall review each such application and
shall forward the application to the Finance Committee of City Council with a
recommendation based on the criterion herein established. Likewise, the Finance
Committee shall review each application in conjunction with the Administrative
recommendation and shall forward the application, with their recommendation to
City Council for review and final action.
      (3)   The City hereby establishes a policy to encourage employment growth
and economic development in order to provide a balance between jobs and
housing, provide adequate income levels for its citizens, and to promote
balanced and orderly growth. Further, it is the intent of this section to
establish a mechanism that removes potential regulatory barriers to the
establishment of businesses that provide employment and economic development in
the City, and it is the further specific intent of this section that the waiver
provisions contained herein shall not apply to residential developments. The
City specifically desires to review all applications for exemptions or waivers
on an individual basis and further desires that the review and approval process
is fair, consistent, and is based on established criteria. Also, the process
should ensure that the businesses that are granted exemptions or waivers
actually provide the benefits recited in this section and that the due process
rights of all applicants are protected.
      (4)   In order to grant an exemption or waiver under this section, City
Council shall:
         A.   Review the Administrative recommendation and the Finance
Committee recommendation, and shall;
         B.   Conduct a public hearing at which the applicant may explain the
elements of their application and present any further information that may
assist in City Council's review, and may;
         C.   Grant the requested exemption or waiver only if they, by majority
vote find and determine that;
            1.   The application fully meets the policies herein established;
and
            2.   The projected employment growth is based on either existing
payroll figures or other available evidence that reflects a potential annual
payroll that exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000) and it is recognized that
this threshold may be adjusted upward based on an annual Council review; and
            3.   The existing or projected number of jobs exceeds 20; and
            4.   The value of the exemption or waiver is recovered in 18 months
based on projected income tax revenues from the development.
   (b)   Effect of Grant of Exemption/Waiver. If the City Council grants an
exemption or waiver in whole or in part of impact fees otherwise due, the
amount of the impact fees exempted or waived shall be provided by the City from
non-impact fee funds, as may be provided in the particular impact fee
ordinances establishing such fees for particular capital improvements, and such
funds shall be deposited to the appropriate impact fee account within a
reasonable period of time consistent with the applicable City capital
improvements program.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 8-21-07.)
1486.09 PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES IMPACT FEE.
