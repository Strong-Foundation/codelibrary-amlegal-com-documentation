EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time, or to
its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that the
section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance which
enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

shall be made or authorized by Council unless pursuant to contract made with a
person, firm or corporation whom Council determines to be the lowest and best

   SECTION 7. LIMITATION ON RATE OF TAXATION.
   The taxing authority of this Municipality shall be in all respects, subject
to the limitation therein provided by the Constitution and laws of the State of
Ohio and nothing contained in this Charter shall be construed to authorize a
levy of any taxes by this Municipality in excess of said limitations without
the vote of the people.
   SECTION 8. SUBMISSION OF EXTRA LEVY.
   The Council may at any time at least ninety (90) days prior to a November
election or the date of the special election designated in the resolution
herein provided, declare by resolution, adopted by a vote of a majority of the
members of Council eligible to vote, that the amount of taxes which may be
raised within the limitations of this Charter will be insufficient to provide
an adequate amount for the necessary requirements of the Municipality for
current operating expenses, and other expenses payable from the general fund of
the Municipality, and such permanent improvements and equipment as shall have
an estimated useful life of five (5) years or more; and that it is necessary to
levy taxes in excess of such limitations, in addition to the levies authorized
and limited by this Charter for the municipal purpose or purposes specified in
such resolution. Such resolution shall specify the additional sum which it is
necessary to levy, the purpose or purposes thereof, the additional rate
estimated to be required therefor, and the date of any proposed election
thereon. Such resolution shall be effective upon its adoption and shall be
certified within five (5) days thereafter to the election authorities, who
shall place such question upon the ballot at the next succeeding November
election or at such special election specified in the resolution. If a majority
of those voting thereon vote for the approval of such additional levy, the
Council shall immediately make such levy, or such part thereof as its finds
necessary, pursuant to such approval, and certify the same to the County
Auditor, to be placed on the tax list and collected as other taxes.
(Amended 11-7-67)
   The authority of the Council to submit additional levies to a vote of the
people, or to levy taxes upon such other subjects and for such other purposes
as may be lawful under the Constitution or laws of this State, shall not be
deemed impaired or abridged by reason of any provision contained in this
Charter.
   SECTION 9.    DEBT LIMITATION.
   The net indebtedness of the Municipality, created or incurred without vote
of the electors, shall never exceed that percentage, of all property in the
Municipality as listed and assessed for taxation, that has been set by the
Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio. As used in this section, the term
"net indebtedness" shall have the same meaning and shall be calculated in the
manner provided by the laws of the State of Ohio, and the same be amended from
time to time, for the issuance of notes and bonds of municipal corporation.
(Amended 11-7-67)
ARTICLE IX

   SECTION 1. SELECTION OF CANDIDATES AND PROCEDURES.
   Nominations for elective offices of the Municipality shall be made only by
petition, signed by registered electors of the Municipality in number not less
than prescribed by the general election laws of the State of Ohio, and shall
contain no party marks or designation. There shall be a primary election held
whereby the candidates for any office shall file a petition in accordance with
the provisions of this Charter and the general laws of the State of Ohio. The
number of candidates for any office at any regular Municipal election in the
City at large, or in each ward, as the case may be, shall be the two (2)
candidates on the primary election ballot receiving the highest number of votes
at the primary election. In case there shall not be for any office more than
two (2) persons who shall have filed petitions as provided for in this Charter,
then said persons shall be the candidates at the regular election and the
primary for the particular office shall not be held. The name of each person
who is nominated in compliance herewith shall be printed on the official ballot
at the general election and the names of no other candidate shall be printed
thereon. (In no case shall any elector cast more than one vote for any elective
office at any one election.)
   If a citizen who has filed his nomination petition properly for any of the
elective offices shall become disqualified from holding office or die between
(a) the last day for filing nomination petitions and (b) the day of election,
then the County Board of Elections shall make provision on the day of election
to fill the office for which he was a candidate, so that the electors may vote
for a write-in candidate for the office for which he was a candidate.
Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, the general laws of Ohio shall
govern the nomination and election of elective officers of the Municipality.
(Amended 11-2-82)
   SECTION 2. WRITE-IN CANDIDATES.

ARTICLE X
INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, RECALL
   SECTION 1. INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.
   The rights and powers of initiative, referendum and recall are reserved to

provisions of the Constitution and general laws of the State of Ohio. The
people of the Municipality may propose ordinances and resolutions by initiative
petition and adopt them by election. Any ordinance or resolution adopted by
Council shall be subject to referendum under the laws of the State of Ohio. The
Council shall by ordinance establish the procedures by which initiative and
referendum are exercised. (Amended 11-7-06)
   SECTION 2. RECALL.
   The electors of the Municipality shall have the power to remove from office,
by recall election, any elected official of the Municipality. After any elected
official has served six (6) months of his term, a petition demanding his
removal may be filed with the Clerk of Council, who shall note thereon the name
and address of the person filing the petition and the date of such filing, and
deliver to such person a receipt therefor, and attach a copy thereof to said
petition. Such petition may be circulated in separate parts, but the separate
parts shall be bound together and filed as one instrument. Each part shall
contain the name and office of the person whose removal is sought, together
with a statement in not more than two hundred (200) words setting forth the
grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at least that number
of electors which equals twenty-five percent in number of the electors voting
at the last preceding regular municipal election, provided, however, the
petition for recall of a councilman elected from a ward shall be signed by at
least that number of electors of the councilman's ward equal to twenty-five
percent in number of the electors of such ward who voted at the last preceding
regular municipal election.
   Within twenty (20) days after the day on which such petition shall have been
filed, the Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it meets the
requirements. If the Clerk of Council finds the petition insufficient, he shall
promptly certify the particuIars in which the petition is defective, deliver a
copy of his certificate to the person who filed the petition, and make a record
of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of ten (10) days after
the day on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition
sufficient. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition sufficient, he
shall promptly so certify such petition to Council, and shall deliver a copy of
such certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall make a
record of such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five (5) days
after the day on which such delivery shall have been made, Council shall
thereupon fix a day for holding a recall election which shall be not less than
thirty (30) days nor more than forty-five (45) days after the date of such
delivery, and shall cause notice of such recall election to be published on the
same day of each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper determined by
Council to be of general circulation in the Municipality.
   At such recall election, this question shall be placed upon the ballot:
"Shall (naming the officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the office) ?",
with the provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively, and in
the event a majority of the vote is negative such officer shall be considered
as removed, his office shall be deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled
as provided in this Charter. The officer removed at such recall election shall
not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy created thereby. If the officer
is not removed at such recall election, no further recall petitions shall be
filed against him for a period of one (1) year following such election.
ARTICLE XI
FRANCHISES
   SECTION 1. GRANT, AMENDMENT OR RENEWAL.
   The Council may by ordinance grant permission to any person, firm or
corporation to construct and operate a public utility in, on, under or above
any public street or ground within the Municipality. It may prescribe in the
ordinance the kind and quality of service or product to be furnished, and rate
or rates to be charged therefor, and any other terms conducive to the public
interest. Such grant may be amended or renewed in the manner and subject to the
provisions established by this Charter for original grants. Such grant,
amendment or renewal shall be for such a period of time as Council may
determine, and shall not be perpetual or exclusive. No consent of the owner of
property abutting on any public street or ground shall be necessary to the
effectiveness of any grant, amendment, or renewal unless the construction or
operation of the public utility authorized thereby is of such character as to
constitute an additional burden upon such public street or ground. All such
grants, amendments or renewals shall be made subject to the continuing right of
Council to provide reasonable regulations for the operation of such utilities
with preference to such streets and public grounds, including the right to
require such reconstruction, relocation, or discontinuance of appliances, plant
or equipment used in such streets, or public grounds, as shall, in the opinion
of Council, be necessary in the public interest.
   No ordinances making, amending, or renewing such grant shall be passed by
the Council until it shall have been read at three (3) regular meetings of the
Council.
ARTICLE XII

preceding general election setting forth any proposed amendment or amendments
to this Charter, the Council shall forthwith submit such proposed amendment or
amendments to the electors in accordance, in each instance, with the provisions
of the Constitution of Ohio now or hereafter in effect. The Council shall
determine the manner of submission of any proposed amendment or amendments to
the electors to the extent that such submission is not governed by this Charter
or the Constitution of the State of Ohio.
   If any such proposed amendment or amendments shall be approved by a majority
of the electors voting thereon, it or they shall become a part of this Charter;
except that if two or more inconsistent proposed amendments on the same subject
matter shall be submitted at the same election, only the one such amendment

this Charter.

of any such appointee, employee or non-elected official shall expire.
The powers which are conferred, and the duties which are imposed upon any
appointee, employee or non-elected official, commission, board or department of
the Municipality under the laws of the State of Ohio, shall, if such office or
department be abolished by this Charter, be thereafter exercised and discharged

Council shall submit to the electors not later than the next succeeding general
election any such proposed alterations, revisions, or amendments. The members
appointed to said Commission shall serve without compensation. Meetings of the
Charter Review Commission shall be open to the public.
   SECTION 8. CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

material, supplies or services to the City or to a contractor supplying the
City, shall make known that interest and shall refrain from voting upon or
otherwise participating in his capacity as a City officer or employee in the
making of such sale or in the making or performance of such contract. Any such
person who willfully conceals such financial interest or willfully violates the
requirements of this section shall be guilty of malfeasance in office or
position. Violations of this section with the knowledge express or implied of
the person or corporation contracting with or making a sale to the City, shall
render the contract or sale voidable by the Council.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC

   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
181. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 181
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Sheffield Lake to wages, salaries, and other

         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
 191.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits

         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was umeasonable.

            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the City of
Sheffield Lake to purchasers outside the City of Sheffield Lake, provided that

         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the City of Sheffield Lake to the extent that such services are performed in
the City of Sheffield Lake.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the City of Sheffield Lake shall be sitused to the

to which the tangible personal property is used in the City of Sheffield Lake.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City of Sheffield Lake's tax

City of Sheffield Lake to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City of Sheffield Lake
shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the City of Sheffield Lake. The individual

            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to

191.04 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
191.04 of this Ordinance.

business in the City of Sheffield Lake shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the City of
Sheffield Lake. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not
required under Section
191.03, or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
191.01 of this Chapter, of 2.0%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively

of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City of Sheffield Lake the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City of Sheffield Lake in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Sheffield Lake in any month of
the preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(l)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which

not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Sheffield Lake. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City of Sheffield Lake
as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Sheffield Lake income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City of Sheffield Lake the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
the City of Sheffield Lake income tax or income tax withholding requirement to
the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at
the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Sheffield Lake until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of Sheffield Lake during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of
Sheffield Lake income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section

wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,

Lake.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of

City of Sheffield Lake, regardless of the number of days which the employee
worked outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Sheffield Lake.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the

      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City of Sheffield Lake to determine and verify the

income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th
day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City of Sheffield Lake's income tax return.

income tax return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or
before the date the the City of Sheffield Lake income tax return is due, the
Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
City of Sheffield Lake's income tax return. The extended due date of the City
of Sheffield Lake's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due
date of the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Sheffield Lake, the Tax

municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under    division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this

      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Sheffield Lake income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with Sheffield
Lake for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
191.04(C)(1)(g)) within Sheffield Lake.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in Sheffield Lake
and does not expect to be subject to Sheffield Lake income tax for the taxable

briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Sheffield Lake. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within Sheffield Lake, make any sales in Sheffield Lake, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by Sheffield Lake during the taxable year. If
the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by Sheffield Lake for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with Sheffield Lake tax ordinance and rules and
regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving that payment.

agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City of Sheffield Lake, unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the City of Sheffield Lake and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City of Sheffield Lake to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Sheffield Lake,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Sheffield Lake or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this Chapter and of the City of Sheffield Lake's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

Sheffield Lake's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group
of corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be

file a consolidated the City of Sheffield Lake income tax return for that
taxable year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the

length and that there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with
regard to allocation of net profits to the City of Sheffield Lake. A taxpayer
that is required to file a consolidated the City of Sheffield Lake income tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated the City of Sheffield Lake

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City of Sheffield Lake
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of
the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the City of Sheffield Lake. If the

the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Sheffield Lake;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of

Chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Sheffield Lake income
tax return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y)
of Section
191.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"

substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever

one or more members of such an affiliated group.

commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon

      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Sheffield
Lake but was not domiciled there on the first day of January ofthe calendar

191.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section

   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed armual income tax return, the

the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
191.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 70-15. Passed 12-8-15.)

nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City of Sheffield Lake
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the City of Sheffield Lake's tax rate is less than the tax rate in
the other municipality, then the nomefundable credit shall be calculated using
the City of Sheffield Lake's tax rate. However, if the City of Sheffield Lake's
tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in
excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Sheffield Lake,
along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of
nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 70-15. Passed 12-8-15.)
191.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City of Sheffield Lake changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the City of Sheffield Lake. The amended return shall be
filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
 191.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Sheffield Lake. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
191.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
191.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review

 191.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Sheffield Lake does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
191.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
191.09.

191.13  AUDITS.   
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.

provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 70-15.
Passed 12-8-15.)
191.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for nondelivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Sheffield Lake
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(l)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(l)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presmnption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City of
Sheffield Lake official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
    (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 70-15. Passed 12-8-15.)
191.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.

to the City of Sheffield Lake that arises pursuant to the City of Sheffield
Lake's income tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
Sheffield Lake:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 70-15. Passed 12-8-15.)
191.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business ofthe City of
Sheffield Lake as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Sheffield Lake from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers. (Ord. 70-15. Passed 12-8-15.)
191.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Sheffield Lake
ordinance or state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99 for a violation of Section

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the court
may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three

physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio

      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars
($1,075).

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty- day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially equivalent offense
under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or
to a division of a section, of the Codified Ordinances that defines or
specifies a criminal offense shall be construed to also refer to an existing or
former law of this State, another state, or the United States, to an existing
or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense. (ORC 2901.04)
501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOUSE ARREST.
   (a)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to utilize electronically monitored
house arrest as a condition of probation and/or as an alternative for
incarceration for misdemeanor offenses in the City in the course of the
exercise of his duties in the Mayor’s Court.
   (b)   The equipment and devices that shall be utilized to effectuate
electronically monitored house arrest, as it may from time to time be used by
the Mayor, shall conform to all of the rules, regulations and guidelines set
forth in Ohio R.C. 2929.23 as presently enacted and as in the future may from
time to time be modified and shall include but shall not be limited to an
active continuously signalling transmitter and receiver.
   (c)   Should the Mayor choose to utilize electronically monitored house
arrest as a condition of probation and/or as an alternative to incarceration,
the period of time during which electronically monitored house arrest shall be
utilized shall, when added to any time of actual incarceration, not exceed the
maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed upon an eligible offender
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.11 and/or Ohio R.C. 2929.21.
   (d)   Should the Mayor choose to utilize electronically monitored house
arrest as a condition of probation and/or as an alternative to incarceration,
any and all costs of such electronically monitored house arrest shall be paid
for and shall be the obligation of the offender and shall be paid for by the
offender prior to the commencement of his term of electronically monitored
house arrest.
   (e)   Should the Mayor utilize electronically monitored house arrest as a
condition of probation and/or as an alternative to incarceration, the Mayor is
authorized to and may in his sound judgment and discretion allow and permit an
offender who is the subject of electronically monitored house arrest to leave
his place of house arrest to go to and from his place of employment and/or such
other specified places or locations as the Mayor designates and permits.
   (f)   Should any individual be subjected to and serve any period of
probation and/or period of time as an alternative to incarceration under
electronically monitored house arrest, and should such individual while serving
such period of probation and/or period of time as an alternative to
incarceration violate any restrictions, rules, regulations or other terms of
his period of time of electronically monitored house arrest, such individual
shall not receive credit for any time served on his period of electronically
monitored house arrest towards or as a credit for any sentence of imprisonment
imposed upon him and any such period of time served under electronically
monitored house arrest and shall not be credited to nor applied to any term of
imprisonment that was imposed upon such an individual prior to his commencing
his period of electronically monitored house arrest.

      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
 
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   
(b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
         2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to

numbers shall be displayed on such side of such building, dwelling, house or
other structure and/or premises.
   (c)   No person, corporation or other entity without just cause shall
remove, alter or deface any house number properly assigned and placed on or
near a building, dwelling, house or other structure. Nor shall any person,
corporation or entity without just cause place or retain on any building,
dwelling, house or other structure any number other than the number duly
assigned if such additional number could reasonably be mistaken for the
assigned street number.

affixed in a conspicuous position and so arranged as to have the names or other
designations thereon easily changed. The provisions of this subsection shall
not apply to single family residence dwellings.
   (e)   No person, corporation or entity shall fail to install or maintain the
proper numbers and/or directories as required by this section. The numbers
shall be Arabic, shall not be less than three inches in height and the color of
numbers shall contrast with the color of the surface on which they are mounted,
applied or appear and shall be visible and legible from the sidewalk and
street. The owner, agent, lessee, occupant or other person having ownership
and/or control of such building, dwelling, house or other structure, may post
additional sets of address numbers provided that one set complies with the
provisions of this section.
   (f)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this
section shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Any such violation or failure
to comply with the terms of this section shall constitute a separate offense on

processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12 or
registered under the authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the junk watercraft is left is not subject to license or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to possession of the
property can establish that the watercraft is part of a bona fide commercial
operation.

receipt requested, to the person having the right to possession of the property

   (d)   No person shall leave or cause to be left a junk recreational vehicle
and/or junk watercraft on private property five days after receipt of the

vehicle and/or junk watercraft is so left is prima facie evidence of willful
failure to comply with the notice and each subsequent period of thirty days
that a junk recreational vehicle and/or junk watercraft continues to be so left
constitutes a separate offense.

misdemeanor of the first degree.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

(c) of this section is present and that an especially hazardous condition
exists, the officer may direct the operator of the vessel to take whatever
immediate and reasonable actions are necessary for the safety of the persons
aboard the vessel, including directing the operator to return the vessel to
mooring and remain there until the situation creating the hazardous condition
is corrected or has ended. For the purposes of this section, an especially
hazardous condition is one in which a reasonably prudent person would believe
that the continued operation of a vessel would create a special hazard to the
safety of the persons aboard the vessel.
   (b)    The refusal by an operator of a vessel to terminate use of the vessel
after being ordered to do so by a law enforcement officer under division (a) of
this section is prima facie evidence of a violation of Section

adjudication for the child. This division does not limit or affect a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (b) of
this section or for a violation of a prohibition that is substantially
equivalent to that division.
      (5)    Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney
immediately upon completion of the test analysis.
      (6)    The person tested may have a physician, registered nurse, or
qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the

admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a
law enforcement officer.
   (e)    (1)    In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent
violation, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety test
to the operator or person found to be in physical control of the vessel
underway involved in the violation or the person manipulating the water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device involved in the violation and if it is shown by
clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in
substantial compliance with the testing standards for reliable, credible, and
generally accepted field sobriety tests for vehicles that were in effect at the
time the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any testing
standards then in effect that have been set by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, that by their nature are not clearly inapplicable
regarding the operation or physical control of vessels underway or the
manipulation of water skis, aquaplanes, or similar devices, all of the
following apply:
         A.    The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
         B.    The prosecution may introduce the results of the field sobriety
test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding.
         C.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced in division
(e)(1)A. or (e)(1)B. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
      (2)    Division (e)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (e)(1) of this section.
   (f)    (1)    Subject to division (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of this section or for
an equivalent violation, the court shall admit as prima-facie evidence a

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant or child to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's or child's
attorney or, if the defendant or child has no attorney, on the defendant or
child.
      (3)    A report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant or child to whom the report
pertains or the defendant's or child's attorney receives a copy of the report,
the defendant or child or the defendant's or child's attorney demands the
testimony of the person who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend
the seven-day time limit in the interests of justice.
   (g)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital, first-
aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to
this section, is immune from criminal and civil liability based upon a claim of
assault and battery or any other claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for
any act performed in withdrawing blood from the person. The immunity provided
in this division is not available to a person who withdraws blood if the person
engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
   (h)   Division (a)(6) of this section does not apply to a person who
operates or is in physical control of a vessel underway or manipulates any
water skis, aquaplane, or similar device while the person has a concentration

division (j)(2) of this section, the court shall sentence the offender to a
jail term of 30 consecutive days and may sentence the offender to a longer jail
term of not more than one year. In addition, the court shall impose upon the
offender a fine of not less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) nor more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000). In addition to any other sentence that it
imposes upon the offender, the court may require the offender to attend a
drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
      (4)    Upon a showing that serving a jail term would seriously affect the
ability of an offender sentenced pursuant to division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3)
of this section to continue the offender's employment, the court may authorize
that the offender be granted work release after the offender has served the
mandatory jail term of 3, 10, or 30 consecutive days that the court is required
by division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3) of this section to impose. No court shall
authorize work release during the mandatory jail term of 3, 10, or 30
consecutive days that the court is required by division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)
(3) of this section to impose. The duration of the work release shall not
exceed the time necessary each day for the offender to commute to and from the
place of employment and the place in which the jail term is served and the time
actually spent under employment.
      (5)    Notwithstanding any section of the Ohio Revised Code that
authorizes the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or the
placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned
or serving a jail term, no court shall suspend the mandatory jail term of 10 or
30 consecutive days required to be imposed by division (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this
section or place an offender who is sentenced pursuant to division (j)(2) or
(j)(3) of this section in any treatment program in lieu being imprisoned or
serving a jail term until after the offender has served the mandatory jail term
of 10 or 30 consecutive days required to be imposed pursuant to division (j)(2)
or (j)(3) of this section. Notwithstanding any section of the Ohio Revised Code
that authorizes the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or
the placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of being
imprisoned or serving a jail term, no court, except as specifically authorized
by division (j)(1) of this section, shall suspend the mandatory jail term of 3
consecutive days required to be imposed by division (j)(1) of this section or
place an offender who is sentenced pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section
in any treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned or serving a jail term
until after the offender has served the mandatory jail term of 3 consecutive
days required to be imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section.
      (6)    As used in this division (j), "jail term" and "mandatory jail
term" have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2929.01.
         (Ord. 79-07. Passed 11-13-07.)
557.11 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   (1)    Any person who operates or is in physical control of a vessel
or manipulates any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device upon any waters in
this Municipality shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or
tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite
of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for operating or being in
physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or
similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
      (2)    The test or tests under division (a) of this section shall be
administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer having reasonable
grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control of a vessel
or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device in violation of
Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance. The law
enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate which test
or tests shall be administered.
   (b)    Any person who is dead or unconscious or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (a)(l) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C. 313.12 to 313.16.
   (c)    Any person under arrest for violating Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance shall be advised of the
consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical test or tests designated as
provided in division (a) of this section. The advice shall be in a written form
prescribed by the Chief of the Division of Watercraft and shall be read to the
person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the
person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting officer. The
reading of the form shall be witnessed by one or more persons, and the
witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must
submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the
arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation, and
if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time
limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to
the test or tests.
   (d)    (1)    If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest for
violating Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance
to submit to a chemical test or tests as provided in division (a) of this
section, if the arresting officer advises the person of the consequences of the
person's refusal as provided in division (c) of this section, and the person
refuses to submit, no chemical test shall be given. Upon receipt of a sworn
statement of the officer that the arresting law enforcement officer had
reasonable grounds to believe the arrested person violated Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance and that the person refused to
submit to the chemical test upon the request of the officer, and upon receipt
of the form as provided in division (d) of this section certifying that the
arrested person was advised of the consequences of the refusal, the Chief of
the Division of Watercraft shall inform the person by written notice that
the person is prohibited from operating or being in physical control of a
vessel, from manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device, and
from registering any watercraft in accordance with Ohio R.C. 1547.54, for one
year following the date of the alleged violation. The suspension of these
operation, physical control, manipulation, and registration privileges shall
continue for the entire one-year period, subject to review as provided in this
section.
      (2)    If the person under arrest is the owner of the vessel involved in
the alleged violation, the law enforcement officer who arrested the person
shall seize the watercraft registration certificate and tags from the vessel
involved in the violation and forward them to the Chief of the Division of
Watercraft. The Chief of the Division of Watercraft shall retain the impounded
registration certificate and tags and shall impound all other registration
certificates and tags issued to the person in accordance with Ohio R.C. 1547.54
and 1547.57, for a period of one year following the date of the alleged
violation, subject to review as provided in this section.
      (3)    If the arrested person fails to surrender the registration
certificate because it is not on the person of the arrested person or in the
watercraft, the law enforcement officer who made the arrest shall order the
person to surrender it within 24 hours to the law enforcement officer or the
law enforcement agency that employs the law enforcement officer. If the person
fails to do so, the law enforcement officer shall notify the Chief of the
Division of Watercraft of that fact in the statement the officer submits to the
Chief of the Division of Watercraft under this division.
   (e)    Upon suspending a person's operation, physical control, manipulation,
and registration privileges in accordance with division (d) of this section,
the Chief of the Division of Watercraft shall notify the person in writing, at
the person's last known address, and inform the person that the person may
petition for a hearing in accordance with division (f) of this section. If a
person, whose operation, physical control, manipulation, and registration
privileges have been suspended, petitions for a hearing or appeals any adverse
decision, the suspension shall begin at the termination of any hearing or
appeal unless the hearing or appeal results in a decision favorable to the
person.
   (f)    (1)    Any person who has been notified by the Chief of the Division
of Watercraft that the person is prohibited from operating or being in physical
control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar
device and from registering any watercraft in accordance with Ohio R.C.
1547.54, or who has had the registration certificate and tags of the person's
watercraft impounded pursuant to division (d) of this section, within 20 days
of the notification or impoundment, may file a petition in the municipal court
or the county court, or if the person is a minor in juvenile court, with
jurisdiction over the place at which the arrest occurred, agreeing to pay the
cost of the proceedings and alleging error in the action taken by the Chief of
the Division of Watercraft under division (d) of this section or alleging one
or more of the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in this
section, or both. The petitioner shall notify the Chief of the Division of
Watercraft of the filing of the petition and send the Chief of the Division of
Watercraft a copy of the petition.
      (2)    The scope of the hearing is limited to the issues of whether the
law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the petitioner was
operating or in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, whether the petitioner was placed
under arrest, whether the petitioner refused to submit to the chemical test
upon request of the officer, and whether the petitioner was advised of the
consequences of the petitioner's refusal.
   (g)    (1)    The Chief of the Division of Watercraft shall furnish the
court a copy of the affidavit as provided in division (c) of this section and
any other relevant information requested by the court.
      (2)    In hearing the matter and in determining whether the person has
shown error in the decision taken by the Chief of the Division of Watercraft as
provided in division (d) of this section, the court shall decide the issue upon
the relevant, competent, and material evidence submitted by the Chief of the
Division of Watercraft or the person whose operation, physical control,
manipulation, and registration privileges have been suspended. In the
proceedings, the Chief of the Division of Watercraft shall be represented by
the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the petition is filed if the
petition is filed in a county court or juvenile court, except that if the
arrest occurred within a city or village within the jurisdiction of the county
court in which the petition is filed, the city director of law or village
solicitor of that city or village shall represent the Chief of the Division of
Watercraft. If the petition is filed in the municipal court, the Chief of the
Division of Watercraft shall be represented as provided in Ohio R.C. 1901.34.
      (3)   If the court finds from the evidence submitted that the person has
failed to show error in the action taken by the Chief of the Division of
Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in one or more of the matters
within the scope of the hearing as provided in division (f) of this section, or
both, the court shall assess the cost of the proceeding against the person and
shall uphold the suspension of the operation, physical control, use, and
registration privileges provided in division (d) of this section. If the court
finds that the person has shown error in the action taken by the Chief of the
Division of Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in one or more of
the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in division (f) of this
section, or both, the cost of the proceedings shall be paid out of the county
treasury of the county in which the proceedings were held, Chief of the
Division of Watercraft shall reinstate the operation, physical control,
manipulation, and registration privileges of the person without charge, and the
Chief of the Division of Watercraft shall return the registration certificate
and tags, if impounded, without charge.
      (4)    The court shall give information in writing of any action taken
under this section to the Chief of the Division of Watercraft.
   (h)    At the end of any period of suspension or impoundment imposed under
this section, and upon request of the person whose operation, physical control,
use, and registration privileges were suspended or whose registration
certificate and tags were impounded, the Chief of the Division of Watercraft
shall reinstate the person's operation, physical control, manipulation, and
registration privileges by written notice and return the certificate and tags.

Division of Watercraft that the person is prohibited from operating or being in

(Ord. 39-84. Passed 5-9-84.)
935.22 BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   (a)   An approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of
the public water system for all in ground sprinkler systems and where any
potential source of backflow contamination exists. The Service Director or
designee will give notice to the water consumer to install such an approved
device. The water consumer shall, at his or her own expense, install such an
approved device at a location and in a manner approved by the Service Director,
or designee and shall have the inspections and tests made, at his or her own
expense, of such approved device as required by the Service Director or
designee.
   (b)    No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply, other than the regular public
water supply of the City, may enter the supply or distribution system of the
City, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method
of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Service
Director or designee and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).
   (c)    It shall be the duty of the Service Director or designee to cause
surveys and investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served
by the public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public
water supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter

   (d)    (1)    The Service Director or designee shall have the right to enter
at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water
supply or distribution system of the City for the purpose of inspecting the
piping system or systems thereof. On demand, the owner, lessee or occupant of
any property so served shall furnish to the Service Director or designee any
information which he or she may request regarding the piping system or systems
or water use on such property. The refusal of such information, when demanded,
shall, within the discretion of the Service Director or designee, be deemed
evidence of the presence of improper connections as provided in this section.

public water supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall
not be restored until such conditions shall have been eliminated or corrected
in compliance with the provisions of this section.
   (e)    In ground sprinkler system, backflow preventers, shall be listed and
approved by the Service Director or designee. Atmospheric pressure type vacuum
break is an approved device, however, it must be testable, i.e. have test
ports. A reduced pressure type backflow preventer is also acceptable. All
backflow preventers must be tested every year by a person certified by either
the Operator Training Committee of Ohio (OTCO) or the Department of Commerce to
perform such tests. Failure to test as required will result in shut off of
water to the sprinkler system or user if they are not separate. Reinstatement
of water service will be subject to a turn on fee. Owners or users of such
systems will be notified by mail each year in April regarding the required
inspection and are expected to provide a test report to the Sheffield Lake
Water Department from a state certified tester by June 1st. Should no reply
regarding this matter be received by the Sheffield Lake Water Department by
June 15th a letter will be mailed indicating the report was not received and
that if not received by the first work day after June 30th, water service to
the sprinkler or home will be terminated.
   (f)   Immediately upon connection of an inground lawn sprinkling system to
the public water supply, the required backflow prevention device must be in
place and tested and approved for operation by a certified backflow prevention
person. Such person shall have either an OTCO or Department of Commerce
certification. Failure to provide such test and certification of same within
ten (10) days of activation of the system may result in a $500.00 fine and
possible loss of water service. It is the property owner’s responsibility to
assure that such certification is received by the required time. No pump shall
be connected to an inground sprinkler system either to increase pressure or to
purge the sprinkler system. If a pump or air compressor is used to purge the
system, the backflow preventer must be removed and the sprinkler line shut off.
   Continued noncompliance with this regulation subjects the offender to an
immediate fine of $500.00 and termination of water service or loss of backflow
testing certification, as determined by the Service Director.
   (g)   The Sheffield Lake Water Department shall supply and maintain as a
matter of public records, expected standards, guidance and definitions of cross
connection control including: Where Backflow is Required, Type of Protection
Required, Backflow Prevention Devices, Installation, Inspection and
Maintenance, Testing Falsification and water powered sump pumps.
   (h)    Any person, firm, corporation or other entity that violates any

services and use of facilities of the Stormwater Management System by the
owner, tenant or occupant of the premises using the services and facilities of
the System.
   (a)   Council shall, by ordinance, establish reasonable rates for Stormwater
Management Systems for each single family residence. The Stormwater User Fee
for each single family residence shall be a flat fee established by the City
Council for an Equivalent Residential Unit.
   (b)   The Stormwater User Fee for Vacant Improved Property shall be
determined by dividing the total land area of the Vacant Improved Property, in
square feet, by the area of an Equivalent Residential Unit times a correction
factor. The correction factor shall be based on the relative volume of runoff
from a Vacant Improved Property and that of an average single family residence,
under typical hydrologic conditions.
   (c)   For all Developed Property, excluding Exempt Property, not otherwise
provided for by subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Stormwater User
Fee shall be computed based on the total Impervious Area of such property
divided by the average Impervious Area of an Equivalent Residential Unit times
the rate established for an Equivalent Residential Unit. The Stormwater User
Fee shall be updated by the City Engineer based on any additions to the
Impervious Areas as approved through the building permit process.
      (Ord. 01-99. Passed 1-26-99.)
 
943.06 STORMWATER SEWER FUND.
   The Revenues received pursuant to this Chapter
943 shall be deposited with the Finance Director and shall be kept in a
separate and distinct fund known as the Stormwater Sewer Fund. The Stormwater
Sewer Fund shall be used for the payment of the cost of the management,
maintenance, operation and repair of the System. Any surplus in the Stormwater
Sewer Fund may be used for the enlargement or replacement of the System, for
construction and reconstruction of the System, for the payment of interest on
any Indebtedness incurred for the construction thereof, and for the creation of
a sinking fund for the payment of such Indebtedness, but shall not be used for
any other purpose.
(Ord. 01-99. Passed 1-26-99.)
943.07 STORMWATER USER FEES; DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   The rates to be charged for the storm water user fee for each
equivalent residential unit shall be four dollars and eighty-five cents ($4.85)
per month.
   (b)   The rate charged undisturbed property shall be determined by dividing
the total square footage of the property by the square footage of an equivalent
residential unit times a correction factor of 0.0% times the rate of an
equivalent residential unit.
   (c)   The rates to be charged for nonresidential properties, i.e., all other
occupants other than that provided for in subsection (a) and (b) herein, shall
be the rate established in subsection (a) four dollars and eighty-five cents
($4.85.) multiplied by the number of equivalent residential units. The
equivalent residential unit equals the total square footage of impervious area
of the property divided by 2,275 square feet (statistically developed average
for all single family residences in the City of Sheffield Lake). Equivalent
residential units will be rounded to the nearest tenth (0.1) of a unit.
   (d)   Developer Contributions.
      (1)   Single family homes on single lots.
         A.   Any parcel that becomes developed must contribute up to $2,006
per each new home. As each building permit application is reviewed by the City,
the City will determine the exact charge for each new home based on methodology
developed by the City designed to establish an equitable fee in accordance with
Chapter
943. The purpose of this charge is to collet the technically appropriate value
from new development for facilities which have been previously constructed and
maintained by the City.
         B.   When undeveloped land is converted to developed property, the
City will determine which portions of the existing system are necessary to
receive the stormwater runoff from this new development. When the developer
provides facilities on the developed parcel and/or downstream conveyance/
storage facilities, the contribution charge may be reduced. Reduction of the
developer contribution fee will be determined by City Council upon the
recommendation of the Stormwater Utility Appeal Board.

944.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)    Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement,
conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited
except as described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; de-chlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City of
Sheffield Lake to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)    Discharges specified in writing by the City of Sheffield Lake as
being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Lorain Board of

to a facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)    If the City of Sheffield Lake is refused access to any part of the
facility from which storm water is discharged, and the City of Sheffield Lake
demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the City of Sheffield Lake may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to

            (Ord. 24-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
945.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

winter.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City of Sheffield Lake Engineer
and/or the Lorain County SWCD, is required for any one of the following
conditions, as determined in Table 3 below:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence or inlet protection.
         C.   10-acres of disturbed land.
   The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 67 cubic
yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area and have a
minimum of 48-hour drain time for sediment basins serving a drainage area over
5 acres.
   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
         A.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with a generally accepted erosion
prediction model.
   When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and
areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not comingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets
and the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each
one unit of width (> 2:1 length:width ratio), however a length to width ration
of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from the sediment-settling pond
when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent. This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the permissible
drainage area to the silt fence.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
   Based on site conditions, Sheffield Lake Engineer and/or the Lorain County
SWCD may require additional best management practices to control off site
tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
944.09(G) of this regulation.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Sheffield Lake Engineer and/or Lorain
County SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet
disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
       (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the Sheffield Lake Engineer and/or the Lorain County SWCD and all of the
following conditions are met:
         A.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
         B.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
         C.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
   The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are

with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
   (j)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Sheffield Lake Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site.

property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Sheffield Lake.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Sheffield Lake to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Sheffield
Lake's future expense related to the maintenance and repair of stream
crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and road; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in the code.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Lorain County, and the
City of Sheffield Lake shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Service Director.

946.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The storm water system, including storm water management
practices for storage, treatment and control, and conveyance facilities, shall
be designed to prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm
event; to maintain predevelopment runoff patterns, flow, and volumes; and to
meet the following criteria;
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The storm water management practices shall function as an integrated system
that controls flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical,
biological, and chemical integrity of the water resources receiving storm water
discharges from the site. Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter
944.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels. Storm water management practices that meet the criteria
in this regulation, and additional criteria required by the Service Director,
shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: Storm water management practices
shall be designed to achieve the storm water management objectives of this
regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the
site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely
with minimal maintenance.
      (3)   Storm water management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1162 of the Codified Ordinance, shall provide storm water management and water
quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include
provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during
the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-
development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)   Storm water facilities in water resources: Storm water management
practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water resources
unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state,
and local agencies as required in Section
946.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
944 and Chapter
945, all as determined by the Service Director.
      (5)   Storm water ponds and surface conveyance channels: All storm water
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
946.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Service Director that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the storm water
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing storm water
management practice, or if the storm water management requirements for the site
are provided by practices defined in a regional or local storm water management
plan approved by the Service Director.
      (7)   Maintenance: All storm water management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by
the Service Director as detailed in Section
946.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Sheffield Lake,
storm water management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be
on a separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if
compensated by the property owners, by the City of Sheffield Lake. Storm water
management practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots,
protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation; and maintaining unconcentrated storm water runoff to and
through these areas.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated storm water runoff
from BMPs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
   If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be preformed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics.
   (b)   Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria: All storm water management
practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum
removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream relocation or enclosure: The Service Director may allow the
enclosure or relocation of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps,
and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
946.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
944 and Chapter
945, all as determined by the Service Director. At a minimum, stream relocation
designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical
stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site storm water discharges: Off-site storm water runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the storm water conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around storm water quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Service Director that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other storm water management practice from areas too long and/or too large to
maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Service Director.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Service Director,
drainage tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour
storm water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Sheffield Lake's zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Service
Director. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems
when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hours storm. The system shall be designed to meet the requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributory area within the proposed
development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the
development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Service Director.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Sheffield Lake.
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or storm water management practice such that the
runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and
does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year
water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot
below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Sheffield
Lake must be compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material.
   First consideration for the locations(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes
should be given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to
the new floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration
will also be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to
compensate for floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the
contributing watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Sheffield
Lake, reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the
legal boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory
storage areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the
disturbed area. The use of vertical retaining structures is specifically
prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected
   (c)   Storm Water Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to a BMP: The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following storm water management practices. These
practices are listed in Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to
meet the following general performance standards:
         A.   Extended conveyance facilities that slow the rate of storm water
runoff; filter and biodegrade pollutants in storm water; promote infiltration
and evapotranspiration of storm water; and discharge the controlled runoff to a
water resource.
         B.   Extended detention facilities that detain storm water; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled storm water to a
water resource.
         C.   Infiltration facilities that retain storm water; promote
settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured
storm water into the ground. The Sheffield Lake engineer may require a soil
engineering report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
         D.   For sites less than five (5) acres, but greater than one (1) acre
and not part of a common plan of development, where (1) or more acres are
disturbed, the Sheffield Lake Engineer may approve other BMPs if the applicant
demonstrates to the Sheffield Lake Engineer's satisfaction that these BMPs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
946.09(C)(6)
         E.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development for sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Sheffield Lake Engineer may approve other
BMPs if the applicant demonstrates to the Sheffield Lake Engineer's
satisfaction that these BMPs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated
in Section
946.09(C)(6) and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         F.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Sheffield Lake Engineer may approve BMPs not included in Table 2
of this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the
Ohio Departments of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two
Drainage Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all storm water management practices.
Practices chosen must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv) and to
ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Sheffield Lake
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed best management practices
controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local lon-
term hourly records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQv = C*P*A/12
               Where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQv    = water quality volume in acre-feet
               C    = runoff coefficient appropriate form storms less than 1
in.
               P    = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
               A   = area draining into the storm water practice, in acres.
         Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume can be
determined using the list in Table 1 or using the following equation to
calculate the runoff coefficient, if the applicant can demonstrate that
appropriate controls are in place to limit the proposed impervious area of the
development:
   
                  C=0.858i3- 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
                  i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acres)      0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed the runoff coefficient should be calculated using
a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage area to
the storm water treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is High
Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2)=(0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal TO 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the storm water practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of storm water practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Storm water quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
Table 2: Draw Down Times for Storm Water Management Practices
 
Best Management Practice                         Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration Facilities*                         24-48 hours
Extended Conveyance Facilities                   24 hours
(Vegetated Swales, Filter Strips)
• Vegetated Filter Strip with Berm             24 hours
• Enhanced Water Quality Swale                 **
• Flow Through Design
Extended Detention Facilities                    48 hours
• Extended Dry Detention basins***             24 hours
• Wet Detention Basins +                       24 hours
• Pocket Wetland                               24 hours
• Construction Wetlands (above permanent pool) 40 hours
• Bioretention*                                40 hours
• Sand and other Media Filtration
*   The WQv shall completely infiltrate within 48 hours so there is no standing
or residual water pool.
**   Sized to pass a hydrograph with a volume equal to the WQv, a duration of 2
hours, peak rainfall intensity of 1 inch/hour at a depth of no more than 3
inches and have a minimum hydraulic residence time of 5 minutes. The use of this
criterion is limited to sites where the total area disturbed is 5 acres or less.
Prior approval from the Sheffield Lake Engineer is necessary to use this
practice. For sites greater than five (5) acres or less than five (5) acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5)
or more acres, prior written approval is required from the Ohio EPA.
***   The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all extended dry
detention basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
+   Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv.
^   Pocket wetland must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv in
a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDV above the permanent pool must be equal to the
WQv.
NOTE: This table is similar to that found in the Ohio EPA Construction General
Permit. It has been re-ordered to match CRWP's recommended BMP categories and
additional description of the "drain time" for vegetated swales and filter
strips has been added. The "Flow Through Design" BMP is an Ohio EPA alternative
practice and does require additional approvals from the Community Engineer and
Ohio EPA depending the development site size, and can be removed from the table
if necessary.
         D.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility fall within hydrologic soil groups A or B, if the seasonal high water
table is at least three (3) feet below the final grade elevation, and any
underlying bedrock is at least six feet below the final grade elevation.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities.
         A.   Facilities shall be lined with fine turf-forming, flood tolerant
grasses.
         B.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention design drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than 3 feet below the final grade elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a 2.5 foot deep layer of soil amendment with a permeability equivalent
to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is provided.
         C.   Facilities designed according to the flow through design drain
time shall:
            1.   Only be allowed on sites where:
               a.    The total disturbed is 5 acres or less
               b.    The discharge rate from the BMP will have negligible
hydrologic impacts to received waters as described in Section
946.09(C)(6)(b)
               c.   Prior written approval is given by the Sheffield Lake
Engineer; and
               d.   For sites greater than five (5) acres or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, prior written approval has been given by the
Ohio EPA.
            2.   Be designed to slow and filter runoff flowing through the turf
grasses with a maximum depth of flow no greater than 3 inches.
            3.   Be designed to have a minimum hydraulic residence time of 5
minutes.
         D.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow, or a
diffuse flow using a plunge pool, flow diffuser or level spreader, before
entering an extended conveyance facility designed according to the flow through
drain time.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. A valve
shall be provided to drain any permanent pool volume for removal of accumulated
sediments. The outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism,
maintenance, and promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ration of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with hearty plants comparable to wetland vegetation that
are able to withstand prolonged inundation.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
         Note:   The section below identifies the criteria that are currently
being used by the Ohio EPA to assess the equivalency of alternative practices
that are not listed in Table 2. This section can be modified to meet the needs
of the Community.
      (6)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction BMPs:
The applicant may request approval from the Sheffield Lake Engineer for the use
of alternative structural post-construction BMPs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Sheffield Lake Engineer that these BMPs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is
necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative BMP has a minimum total suspended slid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected BMP is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the BMP will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the storm water discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The storm water drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) has identified water
quality problems in the receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Storm Water Quantity Control:  The comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan shall describe how the proposed storm water management
practices are designed to meet the following requirements for storm water
quantity control for each watershed in the development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic method approved by the Sheffield
Lake Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) or runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour
storm occurring on the development drainage area before and after development.
These calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
            4.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section
946.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm

If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:
                                                  The Critical Storm Will be:
Equal to or Greater than:                         and Less Than:
---                                               10             1 year
10                                                20             2 years
20                                                50             5 years
50                                                100            10 years
100                                               250            25 years
250                                               500            50 years
500                                               ----           100 years
 
   (e)   Storm Water Management on Redevelopment Projects:  Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing site
impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A one-for-one credit towards the 20
percent net reduction of impervious area can be obtained through the use of
pervious pavement and/or green roofs.
      (1)   Where site conditions prevent the reduction of impervious area,
stormwater management practices shall be implemented to provide storm water
quality control facilities for at least 20 percent of the site's impervious
area.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and storm water
quality control facilities are used, the combined area shall equal or exceed 20
percent of the site.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume that must be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
946.10 may be approved by the Sheffield Lake Engineer.
         (Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City of Sheffield Lake determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
that result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water
quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards.
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of storm water quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 14 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
946.08(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Sheffield Lake Engineer.
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the City of Sheffield Lake to be
applied to community-wide storm water management practices.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices and/or
the retrofit of an existing practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to storm water control such as wetland complexes.
(Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.11 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City of Sheffield Lake prior to
approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Lorain County Auditor
and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Sheffield Lake Engineer, access
easements between a public right-of-way and all storm water management
practices shall be no less than 25-feet wide. The easement shall also
incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 25-foot wide band around the
perimeter of the storm water management practice.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural storm water management practices shall be
restricted against the construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and
other structures that may obstruct the free flow of storm water and the passage
of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final
grade from that described by the final grading plan approved by the City of
Sheffield Lake. Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance
easement may be removed by the City of Sheffield Lake at the property owners'
expense.
(Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed and provided to the Sheffield Lake
Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent storm water
management practices must be installed and made functional, as determined by
the Sheffield Lake Engineer and per the approved Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including a Survey and Inspection, must be
sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional Surveyor
with a statement certifying that the storm water management practices, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan approved by the Sheffield Lake Engineer. In evaluating this
certification, the Sheffield Lake Engineer may require the submission of a new
set of storm water practice calculations if he/she determines that the design
was altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan. The As-Built Survey must provide the location, dimensions, and
bearing of such practices and include the entity responsible for long-term
maintenance as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement as specified in Section
946.08 must be provided to the Sheffield Lake Engineer.
      (Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The City of Sheffield Lake shall inspect storm water management practices
periodically. Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance, the
City of Sheffield Lake shall provide written notification to the responsible
party, as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for
maintenance. Upon notification, the responsible party shall have five (5)
working days, or other mutually agreed upon time, to make repairs or submit a
plan with detailed action items and established timelines. Should repairs not
be made within this time, or a plan approved by the Sheffield Lake engineer for
these repairs not be in place, the City of Sheffield Lake may undertake the
necessary repairs and assess the responsible party.
(Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.14 FEES.
   The Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the City
of Sheffield Lake before the review process begins. The Sheffield Lake Engineer
shall establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for
providing these services.
(Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost, has been deposited with the Sheffield Lake
Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for the City of Sheffield Lake to
perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the
development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the applicant fails to comply with the
provisions of this regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned when the
following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As Built Inspection of all water quality practices is conducted
by the Sheffield Lake Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Agreement signed by the developer,
the contractor, the City of Sheffield Lake, and the private owner or homeowners
association who will take long term responsibility for these BMPs, is accepted
by the Sheffield Lake Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the City of Sheffield Lake may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding
issues with all storm water management structures on the site and the remainder
of the bond shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for
the purpose of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire are tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Sheffield Lake Engineer. This occurs after the completion of
the final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the
site is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods.
The developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Sheffield Lake
Engineer to demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof
of compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within two days.
(Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.17 VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated any of
the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted
under this regulation. (Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.18 APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other
action or inaction by the City of Sheffield Lake in relation to this regulation
may appeal to the court of common pleas. Such an appeal shall be made in
conformity with the O.R.C. Written notice of appeal shall be served on the City
of Sheffield Lake.
(Ord. 25-11. Passed 5-24-11.)
946.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person, firm, entity or corporation; including but not limited to,
the owner of the property, his agents and assigns, occupant, property manager,
and any contractor or subcontractor who violates or fails to comply with any
provision of this regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and
shall be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for no
more than sixty (60) days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall
be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City of Sheffield Lake from instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a Court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful
development, or to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to require
compliance with the provisions of this regulation or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations, or the orders of the City of Sheffield Lake.

         D.   If the application is determined to be complete, the application

or testimony, the Zoning Inspector is authorized to collect such additional
costs from the applicant.

consideration of an application at a public hearing be deferred by submitting a
written request for deferral to the Zoning Inspector prior to the publication
of notice as may be required by this code. The Zoning Inspector may grant such
requests, in which case, the application will be considered at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.
         B.   A request for deferral of consideration of an application
received by the Zoning Inspector after publication of notice of the public

affected by change in ownership.
   (n)   Modifications or Amendments of Approved Applications.
      (1)   For any review procedure, the Zoning Inspector is authorized to
allow minor changes related to design of an approved application where the
change is insignificant and has minimal impact to the overall design of the
development or subdivision. This shall not give the Zoning Inspector the
authority to vary the requirements of this code or any conditions of approval.
      (2)   Where the Zoning Inspector determines that the proposed
modification, amendment, or change is not minor, the applicant shall be
required to resubmit an application and payment of additional fees for the
application to be reviewed in accordance with the procedures and standards
established for its original approval.

shows how the new application has substantially changed to address each of the
findings of the original decision. The Zoning Inspector shall have the
authority to determine if the evidence submitted substantially changes the
application to address all issues as part of the complete application
determination in Section

code shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other

required by Lorain County, the State, or other agencies having jurisdiction.

applications and the decisions related to those applications in City Hall.

      (1)   In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this code,
the date of the application, act, decision, or event, from which the designated
period of time begins shall not be included. The last date of the period of
time to be computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a
legal holiday observed by the City of Sheffield Lake where the City
administrative offices are closed for the entire day, in which case the period
runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a

      (2)   When the period of time prescribed is less than seven (7) days,
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded from the
computation (i.e., business days and not calendar days).
      (3)   When the City offices are closed to the public for the entire day

act, decision, or event may be performed on the next succeeding day which is
not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday observed by the City of Sheffield

with a statement in writing setting forth the reasons for the denial or the
conditions of approval.
         F.   Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not
be an acceptance by the public of the offer of dedication of any street, or
other public ways or open space on the final plat unless they are accepted by
City Council in the form of the adoption of an ordinance.
         G.   The final plat shall be held until acceptance of all improvements

existing immediate or surrounding area or in keeping with the intended
character of such area;
      (4)   That the proposed streets are in accordance with adopted plans and
policies, and have been coordinated with existing streets and that adequate
measures have been taken to provide ingress and egress so as to minimize
traffic congestion in public streets;
      (5)   That the proposed subdivision will not adversely affect the
delivery of governmental services;
      (6)   That applicable review agencies have no objections that cannot be
resolved by the applicant; and
      (7)   That the final plat and improvement plans conform to the approved
preliminary plat, if submitted and approved.
   (f)   Amendments and Withdrawal of Application.
      (1)   No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made in
any plat of a subdivision after final approval has been given by the Planning
Commission and an endorsement is made in writing on the plat, unless the plat
is first resubmitted and the changes approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   If the applicant finds, in the process of preparing improvement
plans, that the approved preliminary plat, if submitted, is not workable and
changes in layout are required, the applicant shall inform the Director of
Public Service. The Director of Public Service may require that a revised
preliminary plat be submitted for re-approval following the review procedure in
Section
1105.05(d): Major Subdivision Review Procedure, above if the changes
significantly alter the design of the subdivision. If the proposed changes are
technical or minor and do not substantively alter the approved preliminary
plat, the Director of Public Service may approve the revisions. Failure to
submit and receive approval of a revised preliminary plat shall void approval
of the preliminary plat and any new submission shall be subject to a new
application.
      (3)   During the final plat process, the Director of Public Service are
authorized to allow minor changes related to the public improvements or design
where there is minimal impact to the overall design of the subdivision. This
shall not give the Director of Public Service the authority to vary the
requirements of this code.
      (4)   Before approval of the final plat, the submitted plat may be
withdrawn or modified. If modified, the review process shall be repeated. If
the application is withdrawn, any application fees shall be forfeited.
      (5)   If during the course of construction, any changes or modifications
are encountered that are not in conformance with the original approved
improvement plans, the subdivider shall submit the modified improvement plans
(which have now become as-built drawings) to the Director of Public Service,
who, if in agreement with such modifications, shall sign these drawings to
indicate approval of the modifications. If the Director of Public Service does
not approve the modifications, the applicant shall be required to bring the
improvements into compliance with the approved improvement plans or the City
may utilize the financial guarantee to correct the issue.
         (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1105.06 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the site plan review procedure is to ensure
that multi-family residential development and all nonresidential developments

its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special meeting, after the
application is determined to be complete.
         B.   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall at a
minimum, consider the review criteria of this section.
         C.   Within sixty (60) days of the Zoning Inspector determining that
the application is complete, the Planning Commission shall make a decision on
the application. In making its decision, the Planning Commission may approve,
approve with modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the
application.
         D.   If the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation within
the established timeframe, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant,
the application shall be deemed approved.
   (d)   Review Criteria. In order to approve a site plan, the Planning
Commission shall determine that:

stage shall be so planned that the foregoing criteria are complied with at the
completion of each stage.
   (e)   Significance of an Approved Site Plan.
      (1)   An approved site plan shall become, for the proposed development, a
binding commitment of the specific elements approved for development. The
approved site plan may be transferred to another person, corporation, or group
of individuals or corporations prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such
a transfer shall occur only upon approval of the Zoning Inspector. A request
for such a transfer or change of ownership shall be presented to the Zoning
Inspector and granted only if the new ownership entity satisfies the
administrative, financial, legal, and all other financial guarantees approved
with the original site plan.
      (2)   All construction and development under any zoning permit and
building permit shall be in accordance with the approved site plan. Any
departure from such plan shall be cause for revocation of the zoning permit

(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1105.07 ALTERNATIVE EQUIVALENT REVIEW.
   (a)   Purpose. Alternative equivalent review is a procedure that allows
applicants to propose unique design options as an alternative to a development
standard established in this code provided it meets or exceeds the intent of
the design-related provisions of this code. It is not a variance, waiver, or
weakening of regulations; rather, this procedure permits a site-specific plan
that is equal to or better than the strict application of a design standard
specified in this code. Alternative equivalent compliance shall apply only to
the specific site for which it is requested and does not establish a precedent
for assured approval of other requests.
   (b)   Applicability. The alternative equivalent review procedure shall be
available only for the following sections of this code:
      (1)   Section
1113.08: Exterior Lighting;
      (2)   Chapter
1115: Landscaping and Screening Standards; and
      (3)   Chapter
1117: Parking and Access Standards.
   (c)   Review Timing.  A request for alternative equivalent review shall be
made concurrently with a site plan review.
   (d)   Alternative Equivalent Review Procedure. The review procedure for any
alternative equivalent review application shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1105.01: Common Review Requirements, as part of a site plan review application,
and in addition to any other provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Planning Commission Review and Recommendation.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall review the code text or map
amendment application at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special
meeting, after the application is determined to be complete.
         B.   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall at a
minimum, consider the comments from staff and the review criteria of this
section.
         C.   The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation on the
application. In making its recommendation, the Planning Commission may approve,
approve with modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the
application.
         D.   If approved, any zoning permit or other related applications
shall demonstrate compliance with the alternative equivalent review approval.
      (3)   Step 3 - City Council Review and Decision.
         A.   Following receipt of the recommendation from the Planning
Commission (Step 2), the application shall be placed on City Council's agenda
for the next regularly scheduled meeting, if in compliance with notification
requirements, or City Council shall set a time for a public hearing on the
proposed alternative equivalent review.
         B.   Notification of the public hearing shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1105.01(i): Public Notification for Public Hearings.
         C.   City Council shall review an alternative equivalent review
application during a public hearing. In reviewing the application, City Council
shall at a minimum, consider the recommendation from Planning Commission and
the review criteria of this section.
         D.   Within a reasonable time after the close of the public hearing,
City Council shall adopt, adopt with some modification, or deny the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
            i.   If the Planning Commission recommends a denial of the
conditional use application, then approval by City Council shall require an
affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds (2/3) of the full membership of
City Council.
            ii.   In all other cases, then approval by City Council shall only
require concurring vote of a simple majority of the full membership of City
Council.
   (e)   Review Criteria. Decisions on an alternative equivalent review
application shall be based on consideration of the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject
design or development standard to the same or better degree than the subject
standard;
      (2)   That the proposed alternative achieves the goals and policies of
the comprehensive plan to the same or better degree than the subject standard;
      (3)   That the proposed alternative results in benefits to the community
that are equivalent to or better than compliance with the subject standard; and
      (4)   That the proposed alternative imposes no greater impacts on
adjacent properties than would occur through compliance with the specific
requirements of this code.
   (f)   Conditions. The Planning Commission or City Council may impose
conditions on an approval for alternative equivalent review provided such
conditions are related to ensuring the performance of the alternative
equivalent review to meet or exceed the subject standard. Such conditions may
include, required timeframes, amendments or revisions to the proposal, or the
ability to revoke an approval for alternative equivalent review.
   (g)   Decisions.  Any decision on an alternative equivalent review
application shall not be binding on the City related to future applications
requesting an alternative to any of the applicable standards. Each case shall
be review and decided upon based on the individual circumstances.
   (h)   Time Limit.
      (1)   An approval of an alternative equivalent review application shall
expire if the zoning permit expires.
      (2)   Upon expiration of an alternative equivalent review approval, a new
application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new
application will be reviewed.
   (i)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of City Council shall have the right to appeal the decision
the Court of Common Pleas.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1105.08 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to provide limited relief from
the requirements of this code in those cases where strict application of a
particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this
code. It is not intended that a variance be granted merely to remove
inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this code may
impose on property owners in general. Variances are intended to address
extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused by the
applicant's act or omission.
   (b)   Variance Review Procedure. The review procedure for a variance shall
be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1105.01: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - BZBA Review and Decision.
         A.   The BZBA shall hold a public hearing on the variance application
at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special meeting, after the
application is determined to be complete.
         B.   Notification of the public hearing shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1105.01(i): Public Notification for Public Hearings.
         C.   In reviewing the application, the BZBA shall at a minimum,
consider the review criteria of this section.
         D.   The BZBA may request that the applicant supply additional
information that the Board deems necessary to review and evaluate the request
for a variance.
         E.   In making its decision, the BZBA may approve, approve with
modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the application.
         F.   In making its decision, the BZBA shall make specific findings of
fact based directly on the particular evidence presented that the reasons set
forth in the application and as presented by the applicant during the public
hearing, justify the approval, approval with modifications or supplementary
conditions, or denial of the variance application that will make possible a
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
         G.   Within sixty (60) days of the close of the public hearing, the
BZBA shall render a decision on the variance application. The Zoning Inspector
shall notify the appellant in writing of the decision of the BZBA.
         H.   If the BZBA fails to make a recommendation within the established
timeframe, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant, the application
shall be deemed approved.
         I.   The decision of the BZBA shall become effective immediately.
         J.   In approving a variance, the BZBA may impose conditions on the
approval, the proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant
to such approval as it determines are required to be ensure compliance with the
standards of this section and the purpose of this code. Any conditions
established by the BZBA shall relate directly to the requested variance.
         K.   Any violation of the conditions of approval shall be a violation
of this code, subject to the enforcement and penalties of Chapter
1129: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (c)   Review Criteria.
      (1)   Area or Dimensional Variance.  Where an applicant is seeking an
area or dimensional variance, the following factors shall be considered and
weighed by the BZBA to determine if a practical difficulty exists that would
justify approval of the variance. However, no single factor listed below may
control, and not all factors may be applicable in each case. Each case shall be
determined on its own facts.
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or proximity to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
         F.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the applicant (actions of the applicant shall not include the
purchase or acquisition of the property);
         G.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         H.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
         I.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and
         J.   Whether a literal interpretation of the provisions of this code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this code.
      (2)   Use Variance. In order to grant a use variance, the BZBA shall
determine that strict compliance with the terms of this code will result in
unnecessary hardship to the applicant. The applicant must demonstrate such
hardship by clear and convincing evidence that all of the following criteria
are satisfied:
         A.   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under
any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is
located;
         B.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         C.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant
(actions of the applicant shall not include the purchase or acquisition of the
property);
         D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
         E.   If there is an existing building on the lot, such building, due
to its design, cannot be reasonably reused for a permitted use in the district;
         F.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
         G.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of this code; and
         H.   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant.
   (d)   Time Limit.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit a completed application for a zoning
permit and start work within one (1) year of the date the variance was approved
or the approval shall expire.
      (2)   Upon expiration of a variance approval, a new application,
including all applicable fees, shall be required before a variance application
will be reviewed.
      (3)   Upon written request, one extension of one (1) year may be granted
by the Zoning Inspector if the applicant can show good cause for a delay.
      (4)   As part of the variance approval, the BZBA may authorize
alternative time limits for zoning permit issuance based on the scale of the
proposed development.
   (e)   Demolition Related to Variance Approval.
      (1)   The BZBA may grant a variance conditioned on the applicant
demolishing an existing structure. Should the applicant fail to demolish the
structure within thirty (30) days of completion of the structure, or within six
(6) months from the issuance of the building permit, whichever occurs first,
the variance shall be rescinded. The Building Inspector shall inspect the
property and shall revoke any building permits issued pursuant to the order of
the BZBA if the variance applicant fails to timely comply with all conditions
set by the BZBA.
      (2)   Whoever fails to comply with the provisions of this section by not
demolishing a structure within the time limits set forth herein shall be in
violation of this code and subject to the penalties established in Chapter
1129: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (f)   Appeals.  Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the BZBA shall have the right to appeal the decision the
court of common pleas as provided in ORC Chapters 2505 and 2506.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1105.09 ZONING PERMIT.
   (a)   Purpose.  A zoning permit shall be required in accordance with the
provisions of this section in order to ensure that proposed development
complies with the standards of this code, and to otherwise protect the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, altered or
added to, nor shall any building, structure or land be used or changed in use
without a zoning permit issued by the Zoning Inspector. A change in tenancy or
ownership of a residential dwelling unit shall be exempt from the zoning permit
requirement.
      (2)   A zoning permit may be required for the establishment of certain
temporary or accessory use as established in Chapter
1111: Accessory and Temporary Use Regulations.
      (3)   The use of vacant land shall require the issuance of a zoning
permit.
      (4)   Unless otherwise specifically exempted in Section Chapter
1119: Signs, signs shall require a zoning permit.
      (5)   Zoning permits shall be issued only in conformity with the
provisions of this code unless the application is subject to an approval by the
BZBA or Planning Commission providing for additional standards, conditions, or
modifications, in which case, the zoning permit shall be issued in conformity
with the provisions of those approvals, as applicable.
      (6)   Failure to obtain a zoning permit shall be a violation of this code
subject to the provisions of Chapter
1129: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (c)   Terminology and Simultaneous Review.
      (1)   For the purposes of this code, the zoning permit review shall be an
administrative review that may be applied to permits or certificates of other
names (e.g., sign permits, temporary use permits, etc.) if stated in this code.
In such cases, the procedure of this section shall still apply.
      (2)   Where a zoning permit or similar administrative permit is required
in addition to a building permit, such permits may be reviewed simultaneously
under the building permit application.
   (d)   Zoning Permit Review Procedure. The review procedure for a zoning
permit shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1105.01: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Zoning Inspector Review and Decision.
         A.   The Zoning Inspector may distribute the application to other
staff members and other City departments to solicit comment on the zoning
permit application.
         B.   For any zoning permit application for development or applicable
activities in a special flood hazard area, the City Engineer shall be required
to also review and make a decision on the zoning permit application as it
relates to any flood-related regulations. If the City Engineer recommends
denial based on flood-related regulations, such recommendation shall be made to
the Zoning Inspector who shall not approve the application.
         C.   Within thirty (30) days after the application is determined to be
complete, the Zoning Inspector shall make a decision either approving or
denying the permit application. An extension on the decision may be granted
with approval from the applicant. Where the proposed development is within a
special flood hazard area, the City Engineer shall be required to make a
decision within the same timeframe.
         D.   Prior to finalizing approval of the application, the Zoning
Inspector shall have the authority to provide comments to the applicant
regarding necessary revisions to bring the application into full compliance.
The application shall not be deemed formally approved until the applicant makes
all of the appropriate changes and submits all necessary revised forms, maps,
and documents to the Zoning Inspector.
   (e)   Review Criteria.  In order to approve any zoning permit, the Zoning
Inspector shall determine the following:
      (1)   The application complies with all applicable provisions of this
code and the applicable zoning district; and
      (2)   The application complies with all approved plans, conditions, or
other development approvals.
   (f)   Time Limit and Abandoned or Suspended Work.
      (1)   The applicant shall obtain an approved building permit, and begin
construction, within one (1) year of the date the zoning permit is approved or
the approval shall be revoked. The date of approval shall be the date the
Zoning Inspector provides a signed copy of the permit to the applicant.
      (2)   For activities that do not require a building permit, the activity
shall have been substantially begun within one (1) year of approval and is
thereafter pursued to completion, as determined by the Zoning Inspector.
      (3)   The deadlines in paragraph (1) or (2) may be reduced if the work is
mandated by this code or by order of the Zoning Inspector, Director of Public
Service, or BZBA. In such cases, the deadline for construction shall be noted
on the zoning permit.
      (4)   Time limits for permitted temporary uses and structures shall be as
authorized in Section
1111.02: Temporary Uses and Structures. An approval of a zoning permit for a
temporary use shall include the approved start and end dates for the proposed
temporary use.
      (5)   If construction activities for which a zoning permit has been
issued are abandoned or suspended for a period of six (6) months after the time
of commencing the work, the zoning permit approval shall be revoked.
Abandonment shall be defined as the lack of building activity or progress
towards achieving the scope of work defined in the zoning permit.
      (6)   Upon written request, up to two extensions of six (6) months may be
granted by the Zoning Inspector if the applicant can show good cause for a
delay.
      (7)   The Zoning Inspector shall notify the application of the revocation
of a zoning permit including notice that further work as described in the
canceled permit shall not proceed unless and until a new zoning permit has been
obtained or extension granted.
      (8)   Upon revocation of a zoning permit approval, a new application,
including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new zoning permit
application will be reviewed.
      (9)   The above time limits shall not apply if alternative time limits
have been approved by Planning Commission or City Council as part of a site
plan or Planned Residential Development approval.
      (10)   For the purposes of this section, construction is deemed to have
begun when all necessary excavation and piers or footings for one or more
principal buildings included in the plan shall have been completed.
   (g)   Revoking a Zoning Permit. A zoning permit shall be revocable, if among
other things, the actual development activity does not conform to the terms of
the application and permit granted thereon. In the event of the revocation of a
permit, an appeal may be taken to the BZBA in accordance with Section
1105.10: Appeals, of this code.
   (h)   Appeals.  Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Zoning Inspector shall have the right to appeal the
decision to the BZBA as established in Section
1105.10: Appeals.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1105.10 APPEALS.
   (a)   Purpose. This section sets out the procedures to follow when a person
claims to have been aggrieved or affected by an administrative decision made in
the administration or enforcement of this code.
   (b)   Applicability.

   (c)   Zoning District Map. All land within the City of Sheffield Lake shall
be placed into at least one of the zoning districts established in
Table 1107-1: Zoning Districts, and such zoning shall be shown on the Zoning
Map of Sheffield Lake, Ohio. The Zoning Map, together with all explanatory data
thereon, including all changes thereof as hereinafter provided, shall be
incorporated and made a part of this code, thereby having the same force and
effect is if fully described in writing.
   (d)   Interpretation of Zoning District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning districts are shown upon the Zoning Map. When uncertainty exists with
respect to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the
following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following a lot line, such lot line shall be the zoning district boundary.
      (2)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following a center line of a street or highway, alley, railroad easement, or
other right-of-way, or a river, creek, or other watercourse, such centerline
shall be the zoning district boundary. In the event of a natural change in the
location of such streams, rivers, or other water courses, the zoning district
boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline.
      (3)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following City limits, such City limits shall be the zoning district boundary.
      (4)   When the actual street, right-of-way, property line boundary or
other existing ground condition is in conflict with that shown on the Zoning
Map, the BZBA shall provide the necessary interpretation. The person contesting
the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to present their case to the City and to submit technical evidence if so
desired pursuant to the appeals process as established in Section
1105.10: Appeals.
   (e)   Vacation of Public Rights-of-Way.  Whenever any street, alley or other
public way is vacated in a manner authorized by law, the zoning district
adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically
extended to the center of such vacation and all areas included in the vacation
shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended
district. (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1107.03 ZONING DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENTS.
   In addition to the overall purpose of this code, the following are the
purpose statements for the individual zoning districts in the City of Sheffield
Lake.
   (a)   R-1 Residence District. For the purpose of this code, the R-1 District
shall have the same requirements as the R-1A District and shall be enforced as
such.
   (b)   R-1A and R-1B Residential District.
      (1)   The purpose of the R-1A and R-1B residential zoning districts are
to provide for the development and use of land for primarily single-family,
detached residential uses reflective of the primary residential land uses in
the City of Sheffield Lake. These districts are intended to establish standards
for the design, use, and location of principal and accessory buildings to
maintain high-quality neighborhoods.
      (2)   The R-1B District was specifically created for the purpose of
protecting areas of the City that have smaller lots than required in the R1-
B District. As such, no zoning map amendment application may be submitted to
rezone property to the R-1B District after the effective date of this code.
   (c)   R1-C Cottage Residential District.  The purpose of the R-1C
residential zoning district is similar to the R-1A and R-1BDistricts in that it
is intended to allow for the use of land primarily for single-family, detached
residential uses. The R-1C District recognizes that parts of the City have site
characteristics reflective of denser development patterns that were common
among the cottage developments along Lake Erie. Development in these areas is
far more compact than in other single-family residential districts and the
purpose of this district is to protect the characteristics of these dense
neighborhoods in Sheffield Lake. As such, no zoning map amendment application
may be submitted to rezone property to the R-1C District after the effective
date of this code.
   (d)   R-2 and R-3 Residential Districts. The purpose of the R-2 and R-
3 residential districts is to provide for residential areas in the City that
provide for attached housing options, which in turn promote more diverse
housing choices and that may serve as a transitional use between lower-density
residential uses and the City's business activity areas. The purpose of the
regulations in these districts is to ensure the long-term viability of uses
that are designed in a manner that will contribute to the community aesthetic.
   (e)   B-1 Business District. The purpose of the B-1 Business District is to
provide areas for small-scale business development, a limited range of office
uses, as well as convenience goods and services to serve the day-to-day needs
of those living in the City. The design of uses is focused on small-scale,
neighborhood uses.
   (f)   B-2, B-4, and B-5 Business Districts. The purpose of the B-2, B-4, and
B-5 Business Districts is to accommodate a wide-range of professional offices,
general commercial uses, and larger scale businesses that sell goods and
provide services to the general public in the City and to the greater region.
Each district provides for a different scale and intensity of business uses.
While pedestrian level activity and access is highly encouraged, the City
recognizes that vehicular access is also important to the businesses in the
City's large-scale business areas.
   (g)   I-1 Industrial District. The purpose of the I-1 District is to provide
an area to accommodate manufacturing, general businesses, offices, service and
repair businesses, and warehousing uses in a form that largely takes place
within enclosed buildings to allow for quiet and clean industrial areas. It is
the intent of this district to allow for a broad range of industrial uses.
   (h)   P-I Public and Institutional District.  The purpose of the P-
I District is to establish sites for various governmental, institutional,
educational, or other public or quasi-public uses that are integral parts of
the community while also ensuring compatibility with the surrounding
neighborhoods.
      (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1107.04 ALLOWED PRINCIPAL USES.
   
Table 1107-3 lists the principal uses allowed within the various zoning
districts, except PRD Districts. Chapter
1109: Planned Residential Developments (PRD) identifies the uses that are
allowed in PRDs.
   (a)   Explanation of Table of Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Permitted Uses.
         A.   A "P" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed by-right in
the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other
applicable standards of this code.
         B.   Permitted uses are approved administratively through the site
plan review process (See Section
1105.06: Site Plan Review.) or by the Zoning Inspector through the zoning
permit procedure, unless subject to additional reviews (e.g., variance, etc.).
      (2)   Permitted Uses with Standards.
         A.   A "PS" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed by-right in
the respective zoning district if it meets the additional standards as
identified in the last column of
Table 1107-3. Permitted uses with standards are subject to all other applicable
standards of this code.
         B.   Uses permitted with standards are approved administratively
through the site plan review process (See Section
1105.06: Site Plan Review.) or by the Zoning Inspector through the zoning
permit procedure, unless subject to additional review (e.g., variance, etc.).
      (3)   Conditional Uses.
         A.   A "C" in a cell indicates that a use may be permitted if approved
through the conditional use review procedure (See Section
1105.03: Conditional Uses.). Conditional uses may be subject to use-specific
standards as identified in the last column of
Table 1107-3. Conditional uses are subject to all other applicable standards of
this code.
         B.   The existence or lack of additional use-specific standards in
this code shall not be implied to be the only standards the use is required to
meet. Any conditional use listed in the table shall be subject to the general
review standards for all conditional uses established in Section
 1105.03(d).
      (4)   Prohibited Uses. A blank indicates that a use is prohibited in the
respective zoning district.
      (5)   Use-Specific Standards.
         A.   The numbers contained in the "Use-Specific Standards" column are
references to additional standards and requirements that apply to the use type
listed. Standards referenced in the "Use-Specific Standards" column apply in
all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly stated.
         B.   Use-specific standards shall only apply if the use is permitted
with standards (PS) or a conditional use (C). If the use is permitted with
standards in some districts and conditional in other districts, the use-
specific standards shall apply to both the districts where it is permitted with
standards and where it is conditionally permitted.
         C.   This section provides site planning, development, and/or
operating standards for certain land uses that are permitted with standards or
conditionally permitted in
Table 1107-3.
         D.   The land uses and activities covered by this section shall comply
with the applicable use-specific standards in all districts unless otherwise
specified, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this code.
   (b)   Multiple Uses. If multiple uses are proposed on a single lot or in a
single building then each of the individual uses has to be allowed in the
applicable zoning district and reviewed in accordance with how the individual
use is allowed in the district (i.e., permitted, permitted with standards, or
conditional use).
   (c)   Use Determination and Unlisted Uses. Any use not specifically listed
shall be considered prohibited unless approved through the following:
      (1)   The Zoning Inspector shall make the determination if a proposed use
is permitted, permitted with standards, a conditional use, or a prohibited use
under the provisions of this section.
      (2)   The Zoning Inspector may determine that a proposed use is
substantially similar to a use that is permitted, permitted with standards, or
a conditional use established in
Table 1107-3 based on the proposed use activities, character of the business,
similarity to existing uses within the City, or information on the use as may
be available from third-party land use resources such as documentation from the
American Planning Association, Urban Land Institute, or similar organizations.
If the Zoning Inspector finds that the proposed use is substantially similar to
a use established in
Table 1107-3, then the application shall be processed in the same manner as the
similar use.
      (3)   In finding that a proposed use is similar to a use established in
Table 1107-3 the Zoning Inspector shall make a note of the similar use in the
approved application form.
      (4)   If the Zoning Inspector makes the determination that a use is
prohibited, the application shall not be processed, and the application fee
shall be returned.
      (5)   If the applicant disagrees with the Zoning Inspector's
determination regarding the proposed use, the applicant may choose to take one
of the following actions:
         A.   The applicant may appeal the determination of the Zoning
Inspector to the BZBA pursuant to Section
1105.10: Appeals; or
         B.   The applicant may present their case to the Planning Commission
and/or City Council to request that the City initiate a text amendment to
address the proposed use and applicable standards.

have the purpose or effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment of their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

   (a)   The purpose of the Planned Residential Development (PRD) District is
to provide a means for encouraging ingenuity, imagination, and flexibility in
the planning and designing of land areas and permitting uses and intensities of
residential development while mitigating potential adverse impacts on
surrounding areas. The PRD regulations provide a controlled flexibility by
utilizing objectives and performance standards rather than rigid design
requirements, the intent being to encourage developments which possess greater
amenities than that resulting under standard zoning district requirements.
   (b)   It is not the intent of the PRD to allow applications to circumvent
the intent of this code to permit residential density and housing types, or
street and utility layouts that conflict with adopted City plans and policies,
or the character of the area.
   (c)   It is furthermore the purpose of the PRD regulations to:
      (1)   Encourage creative and high-quality developments that are
compatible with surrounding land uses, achieve a high degree of pedestrian-
vehicular separation, and contribute to the overall quality of Sheffield Lake;
      (2)   Protect natural features such as topography, trees, and drainage
ways in the existing state as much as possible;
      (3)   Provide for appropriate, adequate and usable open space where there
is a residential component to the proposed PRD;
      (4)   Ensure that there are adequate services and infrastructure to serve
the proposed development and not decrease the services or infrastructure for
existing uses; and
      (5)   Promote a harmonious design among the various elements and uses
within the development while mitigating any potential negative impact on
surrounding properties.
         (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)

criteria for PRDs as established in this chapter.
         F.   As part of the PRD development plan submittal, the applicant may
propose a schedule for completion of different phases of the project.
         G.   In making its recommendations or decisions, the Planning
Commission and/or City Council may impose such conditions of approval as are in
its judgment necessary to ensure conformity to the applicable criteria and
standards. In so doing, the Planning Commission and/or City Council may permit
the applicant to revise the plan and resubmit it as a PRD development plan
within sixty (60) days of such action. Such resubmission shall be made to the
board that imposed such conditions.
      (5)   Step 5 - Subdivision.
         A.   After approval of the PRD zoning map amendment and development
plan, the applicant may proceed with a major subdivision, in accordance with
Section
1105.05: Major Subdivisions.
         B.   As part of the PRD concept plan review, the applicant may request
that the PRD development plan review occur simultaneously with the preliminary
plat approval for a major subdivision.
   (d)   Review Criteria.
      (1)   PRD Concept Plan Review Criteria.  The PRD concept plan is reviewed
only regarding its general conceptual merit, and in no way shall commit any
future acceptance or rejection of detailed design elements required in the PRD
development plan. The decision on the PRD concept plan shall take into
consideration whether:
         A.   The proposed development is in conformity with the goals,
policies, and any applicable recommendations of adopted plans;
         B.   The proposed development meets the intent and spirit of this code
and all other applicable City ordinances;
         C.   The proposal meets the intent and objectives of this PRD chapter;
         D.   The proposed development provides a development pattern which
preserves and utilizes the natural topography, geologic features, scenic
vistas, natural vegetation and natural drainage patterns of the site;
         E.   The proposal is conceptually sound in that it conforms to
accepted design principles in the proposed functional roadway system, land use
configuration, open space system, drainage system and scale of the developed
elements;
         F.   The proposed development is accessible from public thoroughfares
adequate to accommodate the traffic which will be imposed on them by the
proposed development, and the proposed streets and parking areas within the
site are adequate to serve the proposed arrangement and densities of land uses;
         G.   The proposed development provides a higher quality and more
useful design of landscaping and open space and amenities than would normally
be required under the strict application of existing zoning and subdivision
requirements;
         H.   The proposed development promotes greater efficiency in the use
of land and does not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities
such as fire and police protection, public works, schools, water supply and
wastewater disposal due to excessive population densities;
         I.   The proposed development is not likely to result in significant
adverse impacts upon the natural environment, including air, water, noise,
storm water management, wildlife, and vegetation, or such impacts will be
substantially mitigated; and
         J.   The proposed development can be substantially completed within
the time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the developer.
      (2)   Review Criteria for the PRD Development Plan Review Criteria. In
reviewing the PRD zoning map amendment and development plan, the Planning
Commission and City Council shall take the following into consideration:
         A.   The proposed development maximizes the opportunity for privacy
within residential areas and minimizes nuisances between residential areas and
other land uses based on setbacks, landscaping, and buffering;
         B.   The proposed development contains such proposed covenants,
easements, association by-laws and other such provisions as may reasonably be
required for the public health, safety, and welfare;
         C.   Where common open space is required, appropriate arrangements
with the applicant have been made which will ensure the reservation of common
open space as identified on the PRD development plan. Furthermore, the PRD
development plan shall demonstrate how the open spaces shall be duly
transferred to a legally established homeowner's association or has been
dedicated to the City or another public or quasi-public agency for preservation
and maintenance;
         D.   Appropriate agreements with the applicant have been made to
ensure the proper completion of public improvements in compliance with the
subdivision requirements of this code.
         E.   Each individual phase of the development can exist as an
independent unit that can create an environment of sustained desirability and
stability, or that adequate assurance will be provided that such objective can
be obtained;
         F.   That any exception from the design standards provided in the PRD
concept plan is warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the
detailed PRD development plan; and
         G.   The PRD development plan has been transmitted to all other
agencies and departments charged with responsibility of review and any
identified issues have been reasonably addressed by the applicant.
   (e)   Time Limits for the PRD Final Plan.
      (1)   Any PRD development plan shall be valid for a period of two (2)
years after the date of approval by the City Council. If no development has
begun (development being defined as the start of construction of the required
public/private improvements as shown on the approved PRD development plan for
one or more phases of the project) in the PRD within two (2) years from the
date of approval, such approval of the PRD development plan shall lapse and be
of no force and effect.
      (2)   Two, one (1)-year extensions of the time limit set forth herein,
may be granted by the Planning Commission if such extension is not in conflict
with the most current adopted City plans or policies, and that such extension
is in the best interests of the entire community. The developer/owner shall
apply for an extension and shall state the reason for the extension.
      (3)   If an approved PRD development plan lapses as provided herein, the
originally approved PRD development plan shall also be considered void. Notice
of such lapse shall be filed by the Planning Commission and forwarded to the
City Council.
      (4)   Voiding of the PRD development plan shall not rezone the property.
After such plans are voided, the Planning Commission, the City Council, or
property owners may initiate a rezoning to a base zoning district in accordance
with Section
1105.02: Code Text and Map Amendments. As an alternative, the property owner,
or their agent, may resubmit a new PRD concept plan and development plan in
accordance with the procedures of this chapter. In the case of a new PRD
concept plan and development plan submission, the procedure shall be the same
even though a zoning map amendment shall not be required.
   (f)   Changes to Approved PRDs.
      (1)   A PRD shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the
approved PRD development plan including all supporting data and conditions. The
PRD development plan and supporting data, together with all recorded
amendments, shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and
assignees, and shall limit and control the use of premises (including the
internal use of buildings and structures) and the location of structures in the
PRD as set forth therein.
      (2)   Where a property owner on a lot in a PRD seeks a variance from the
applicable standards for an individual property that will not apply to any
other property in the PRD, the property owner shall request such variance in
accordance with Section
 1105.08: Variances.
      (3)   Any request to change or otherwise modify the approved PRD
development plan as it applies to more than one property owner, shall be
reviewed based on whether the change is considered major or minor, in
accordance with this subsection.
      (4)   Major Change.
         A.   Major changes to a PRD require the prior approval of the Planning
Commission and the City Council in the same process, and with the same
hearings, as that used to review of the PRD development. The Zoning Inspector
shall have the authority to determine if a proposed change is a major change.
Major changes include, but are not limited to:
            i.   Expansion of the PRD project beyond the original tract
coverage;
            ii.   Removal or subtraction of land from the original tract
coverage;
            iii.   Any increases to the number or density of dwelling units, or
the types of dwelling units; and
            iv.   Other similar major changes as determined by the Zoning
Inspector.
         B.   If the proposed change is not approved, the originally approved
PRD development plan shall remain valid until the expiration established in
Section
1109.06(e).
      (5)   Minor Changes.
         A.   Minor changes are those proposed by the developer/owner which do
not disturb or affect the basic design and approved PRD development plan, and
which are essentially technical in nature, as determined by the Zoning
Inspector.
         B.   Examples of minor changes include, but are not limited to, change
in the intensity of lighting, changes in the size and location of water and
sewer lines within approved easements and changes in the location and number of
fire hydrants.
         C.   The Zoning Inspector shall notify the Planning Commission of all
such approved minor changes.
            (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1109.07 PERMITTED USES AND DENSITIES.
   (a)   Principal Uses.
      (1)   Only those uses listed as residential uses in
 Table 1107-3, whether permitted, permitted with standards, or conditionally
permitted, may be considered in the application of a PRD.
      (2)   The Planning Commission and City Council may also approve public
and institutional uses listed in
Table 1107-3 as permitted uses provided such uses do not occupy the majority of
land area in the proposed PRD.
      (3)   In general, any standards that apply to a specific use in a zoning
district shall also apply to those same uses in a PRD. However, the Planning
Commission and the City Council may adjust or waive any of those use-specific
standards.
      (4)   Any changes in uses within an approved PRD shall be required to be
reviewed as part of a major PRD amendment.
   (b)   Accessory Uses.  Unless modified by the Zoning Commission or Trustees
during the PRD Preliminary Plan or PRD Final Plan approval, accessory uses in a
PRD District shall be subject to the following standards:

uses in a PRD District shall be subject to the standards applied to accessory
uses in the R-1A District.
      (2)   Accessory uses and structures related to multi-family residential
uses in a PRD District shall be subject to the standards applied to accessory
uses in the R-3 District.
   (c)   Residential Densities.
      (1)   For PRDs of less than ten (10) acres, the total gross density shall
not exceed the density permitted in the zoning district that applies prior to
the PRD application.
      (2)   For PRDs of ten (10) acres or more, the total gross density shall
not exceed the density permitted in the zoning district that applies prior to
the PRD application with the ability to increase the gross density, as follows:
         A.   For the first one-half (½) acre of common open space above the
minimum required, a maximum of five percent (5%) density increase is permitted.
         B.   If an additional one-half (½) acre of common open space is
provided, an additional two percent (2%) density increase is permitted.
      (3)   For all PRDs, up to an additional five percent (5%) maximum density
increase can be provided based upon excellence in architectural and landscape
design. This increase must be approved by the Planning Commission and City
Council as part of the PRD concept plan review.
         (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1109.08 OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Amount of Open Space Required.
      (1)   A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area of a PRD
shall be preserved as open space; or
      (2)   The open space proposed for the PRD shall be equivalent to the
total reduction in lot sizes where clustering is used to modify yard, bulk, and
space requirements.
   (b)   Determination of Open Space. The following areas shall not be counted
toward compliance with open space requirements:
      (1)   Private and public roads, and associated rights-of-way;
      (2)   Public or private parking spaces, access ways, and driveways
related to any residential use;
      (3)   Required minimum spacing between buildings and required yard

delinquent in paying the assessment.
   (f)   The Association shall be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed
needs.
   (g)   All homeowners' associations shall guarantee maintenance of all open
space and common areas within the boundaries of the development. In the event

approved land trust or other qualified organization, county, state or park
district, the City may remedy the failure to maintain at its own cost and seek
reimbursement from the homeowner's association, or seek to enforce the
homeowner's association's duty to maintain through an injunction or any other
civil remedy.
      (2)   If the open space or common area exists pursuant to a conservation
easement in which the City is a party to such easement, the City may seek to
enforce the terms of the conservation easement as provided in Chapter
1129: Enforcement and Penalties.
      (3)   If the open space or common area is owned jointly or in common by
the owners of the building lots, or by any other owner of the property to be
maintained, the City may seek to enforce the association's non-performance of
its obligations and duties through an injunction or any other civil remedy.

 Table 1111-1.
      (1)   Permitted Use (P).
         A.   A "P" in a cell indicates that an accessory use or structure is
permitted by-right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are
subject to all other applicable regulations of this code.
         B.   Permitted uses or structures are approved administratively by the
Zoning Inspector through the zoning permit procedure, where required. Accessory
structures or uses that are accessory to principal uses subject to site plan
review shall be reviewed as part of the site plan review process unless the
principal use has already been established, in which case, the accessory
structure or use shall require only a zoning permit approval.
      (2)   Permitted Use with Use-Specific Standards (PS).
         A.   A "PS" in a cell indicates that the accessory use or structure
category is allowed by-right in the respective zoning district if it meets the
additional standards set forth in the last column of
Table 1111-1. Permitted uses with standards are subject to all other applicable
regulations of this code.
         B.   Uses or structures permitted with standards under this category
are approved administratively by the Zoning Inspector through the zoning permit
procedure, where required. Accessory structures or uses that are accessory to

in which case, the accessory structure or use shall require only a zoning
permit approval.
      (3)   Conditional Use (C).
         A.   A "C" in a cell indicates that an accessory use or structure may
be permitted if approved through the conditional use review (See Section
1105.03: Conditional Uses.). Conditional uses may be subject to use-specific
standards as identified in the last code.
         B.   The existence of additional use-specific standards in this code
shall not be implied to be the only standards the use is required to meet. Any
use that is permitted as a conditional use shall be subject to the general
review standards for conditional uses in Section
 1105.03(d).
      (4)   Prohibited Uses.  A blank cell indicates that an accessory use or

identifies if a zoning permit is required for the applicable accessory use or
structure.
      (6)   Yards Permitted. The "Yards Permitted" column identifies in which
yards the applicable accessory use or structure is permitted. See also Section
1113.06(c), for more information about specific yard locations for interior,
corner, through, flag or panhandle, cul-de-sac, or curved street lots, etc.
      (7)   Numerical References (Last Column).  The numbers contained in the
"Use-Specific Standards" column are references to additional standards and
requirements that apply to the use and structure type listed. Standards
referenced in the "Use-Specific Standards" column apply in all zoning districts
unless otherwise expressly stated and may apply to a conditionally permitted
use and/or a permitted use with use-specific standards.

thirty (30) inches of concrete.
      (15)   All post holes shall be inspected by the Building Inspector prior
to the pouring of concrete. There shall be additional inspection fee equal to
the fence permit application fee for each additional inspection beyond two
which the Building Inspector is required to complete. However, the final
inspection required by Section
1361.15 shall not constitute an additional inspection for the purposes of this
section.

thereof, to determine lot lines and to ascertain that the fence or wall does
not deviate from the plans as approved by the Zoning Inspector issuing the
zoning permit, and that the fence does not encroach on another lot or existing
easement. The issuance of the zoning permit and any inspection by the City
shall not be construed to mean that the City has determined the fence is not
encroaching on another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duty
imposed on him or her herein.
      (21)   Nonconforming Fences and Walls.
         A.   Where a nonconforming fence or wall is to be maintained or
repaired, such nonconforming fence or wall may continue to exist. Repair or

fence or wall is to be removed and replaced with a new fence or wall, then the
entire fence or wall shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of
this code. Such replacement shall require the issuance of a new zoning permit.
The fifty percent (50%) threshold shall be calculated as the aggregate
replacement of fence length after the effective date of this code.
   (c)   Measurement.
      (1)   The maximum fence or wall height shall be measured from the lowest
point of the finished grade within three feet on either side of the fence to
the top most portion of the fence. See

boundaries shall be considered the area within the lot lines excluding any area
in a right-of-way.
         B.   Unless otherwise stated, the lot width is the distance between
the side lot lines measured along the building line.
         C.   No lot shall be reduced in area or dimensions so as to make said
area or dimensions less than the minimum required by this code; and, if already
less than the minimum required by this code, said area or dimensions shall not
be further reduced. Exceptions to this standard shall only be granted if a
reduction is approved as part of a planned unit development or variance
approval.
      (2)   Zoning Lots.
         A.   Where a person proposes to combine two (2) or more platted lots
to meet the lot area requirements, such person shall be required to replat the
combined lots as a single zoning lot.
         B.   A person may also split two (2) lots to combine portions of an
existing lot with adjacent lots.
         C.   Such lot splits and replats shall be recorded with Lorain County
after approval by the City in accordance with the minor subdivision procedure
set forth in this code.
         D.   A principal building may be located across two (2) lots of record
without creating a zoning lot.

Table 1113-1 establishes the minimum lot area requirements for residential
districts and for the B-5 and I-1 District.
         B.   There are no minimum lot area requirements for the B-1, B-2, B-4,
or I-1 districts, however, all lots in nonresidential zoning districts shall be
of a size large enough to allow for all proposed buildings and required
setbacks, off-street parking, loading, and stacking spaces, and all landscaping
and screening requirements established in this code while also complying with
the maximum lot coverage.
         C.   Additional lot area may be required for certain conditional uses
as specified in Section
1107.05: Use -Specific Standards.
         D.   For the purposes of measurements of lot area and setbacks, the
rear lot line along Lake Erie shall be the mean lake elevation.

         A.   In any residential zoning district, a minimum front yard setback
shall not be required to exceed the average front yard setbacks of lots with
similar uses and sharing the same street frontage, within 600 feet of the
applicable lot. Modification of the front yard in accordance with this section
will not create a nonconforming lot unless the lot or structure does not meet
other applicable provisions of this code. See
Figure 1113-D.

   1117.04 OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   (a)   Number of Parking Spaces Required.
      (1)   Computation. In computing the number of parking spaces required by
this code, the following shall apply:
         A.   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the gross leasable
horizontal area of all floors of a nonresidential building.
         B.   Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units installed or indicated for, each twenty-four (24) lineal inches
of seating facilities (bench, pew, etc.).
         C.   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next highest whole
number.
         D.   Parking spaces shall be provided according to the schedule of
uses in this subsection. In residential use areas, garages or carports may be
counted as a part of the required parking.
      (2)   Mixed Use Occupancy. In the case of mixed or multiple uses in one
building or on one property, the total requirements for off-street parking may
be reduced as follows:
         A.   The reduction shall be based on the sum of the minimum parking
spaces required in the table in this subsection, computed separately, and
reduced by not more than twenty-five percent (25%). Any reduction in spaces
shall be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Inspector.
         B.   The remaining spaces shall not be reserved for any one use and
shall be available to all patrons or residents of that development.
   (b)   Revision of Parking Lots.  The revision of an approved parking lot,
including, but not limited to, reduction, enlargement, restriping or remarking
of any parking lot in a manner that differs from the existing site plan, shall
require a new site plan approved by the Zoning Inspector prior to the changes
being made.
   (c)   Number of Parking Spaces Required. The number of off-street parking
spaces required shall be based on the requirements of Section
1117.04(c)(1) below or an alternative parking space plan may be provided in
accordance with Section
1117.04(c)(2).
      (1)   Minimum Parking Spaces Table.
         A.   
Table 1117-1 establishes the minimum number of parking spaces required for
individual uses. For uses that are not specifically stated, the Zoning
Inspector may identify a parking requirement that most closely reflects the
land use and intensity of the proposed use or may require and alternative
parking space plan as established in Section
1117.04(c)(2).
         B.   In order to prevent excessive lot coverage, the artificial
increase in ambient air temperature, and an unnecessary increase in surface
water run-off, no application shall propose more than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the spaces required in
Table 1117-1 below unless good cause can be shown by the applicant and approved
by the BZBA through the variance process in Section 1105.08: Variances. Single-
family dwellings and two-family dwellings shall be exempt from this provision.
         C.   An alternative parking space plan is not permitted for uses
marked with an asterisk (*) in
Table 1117-1. An alternative parking space plan shall only be permitted when
the applicant wants to propose less than the number required by
Table 1117-1 below.

deny the application. The Planning Commission may refer to the estimates of
parking demand based on recommendations of the American Planning Association
(APA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI), the Institute of Traffic Engineers
(ITE), or similar resources in making their determination. If the Planning
Commission denies the alternative parking space plan, the applicant shall be
required to meet the minimum number of spaces required by Section
1117.04(c)(1), above or seek approval of a variance in accordance with Section
1105.08: Variances.

         F.   In the event that a shared or off-site parking area is located on
multiple parcels, a written parking agreement shall be required and must be
approved by the Sheffield Lake Law Director.
         G.   No shared or off-site parking space shall be located more than
500 feet from the primary entrance of the use served, measured along the
shortest legal, practical walking route. This route may include crossing a
right-of-way provided it uses a legal crosswalk.
         H.   The applicant shall have the burden of proof for reduction of the
total number of parking spaces and shall document and submit information
substantiating their request. Shared or off-site parking may be approved if it

with
interior parking islands while the parking lot on the right illustrates where
an area
is unimproved but is designated for future parking spaces if the demand arises.
         B.   The parking plan submitted with the site plan application shall
denote the location and layout of that portion of the parking area that
currently is deemed not required. The plan shall indicate that the "land
banked" parking spaces will be constructed according to these regulations if
the Zoning Inspector determines at any time that all or any portion of this
parking is necessary.
         C.   The applicant shall be required to design the site for full
compliance with the applicable stormwater regulations, lighting regulations,

as established above, shall be illustrated on a final site plan, approved as
part of the zoning permit application and maintained as part of the City's
official records.
         E.   At no time shall any portion of the land banked parking area that
is designated for future development be used for the construction of any
structure or paved surface with the exception that pervious pavement may be
used to provide temporary parking provided that the pavers allow for grass and
other vegetation to grow through the material.
         F.   At no time shall any portion of the land banked parking or
loading area that is so designated for future construction as provided herein
be counted as open space or other non-paved areas required by other provisions
of this code.
         G.   The owner shall initiate construction of the approved land banked
parking area(s), as identified on the approved parking plan, within three
months of the receipt of a certified letter or a letter through normal postal
service (if the certified letter is not accepted) sent to the owner of record
from the Zoning Inspector, identifying that such parking is determined to be
necessary. Such determination may be made when the Zoning Inspector:
            i.   Is reviewing an application related to a change of use or
activity; or
            ii.   Documents that vehicles related to the use are consistently
parked on the grass, landscaping area, or on the street.

of delivery vehicles shall be provided for principal uses in the nonresidential
districts. These off-street loading facilities shall be in accordance with the
following specifications:
   (a)   Number of Spaces.  This code does not require a minimum number of off-
street loading spaces. However, uses which receive frequent deliveries are
required to provide adequate space, built to the standards as identified in
this subsection. The Planning Commission may require loading spaces based on
the proposed uses as part of site plan review.
   (b)   Size.  Loading spaces shall conform to the following minimum
dimensions. Unless otherwise noted, all dimensions are exclusive of any
driveway, aisle or other circulation area:
      (1)   Clearance height: fifteen (15) feet

      (3)   The number of stacking spaces required by
Table 1117-3 shall be required for each separate stacking lane. If two (2) or
more stacking lanes converge into one lane (e.g., two (2) lane separate lanes
to order at a restaurant converge to one lane after the drive-through sign),
the stacking spaces shall be measured in accordance with
Table 1117-3 with the spaces located after the convergence point counting
toward both stacking lanes.
      (4)   Vehicles shall not be permitted to wait within the public right-of-
way for service at such drive-in or drive-thru facilities.
   (d)   The Planning Commission may reduce the number of required stacking
spaces when the applicant provides credible documentation, such as studies from
similar sites, that fewer than the required number of stacking spaces does not
impede vehicular traffic flow on the site and ingress/egress to the site. (Ord.
26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)

CHAPTER 1119
Signs
1119.01   Purpose.
1119.02   Substitution and protection clause.
1119.03   Reclassification of signage.
1119.04   Applicability.
1119.05   Review and permit requirements.
1119.06   Prohibited signs.
1119.07   Measurements and computations.
1119.08   General requirements for all signs.
1119.09   Permanent signs.
1119.10   Temporary signs.
1119.11   Nonconforming signs.
   1119.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards to
safeguard life, health, property and public welfare by regulating and
controlling the quality of materials, construction, illumination, installation
and maintenance of all signs and sign structures.
   (b)   In establishing these purposes, the City has determined that signs
which do not comply with these regulations (type, size, location, and
limitation on the number of signs) are a public nuisance. Unregulated signs are
unduly distracting to motorists and pedestrians, and thereby create a traffic
hazard and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public.
   
   (c)   The City does not intend to infringe on the rights of free speech as
protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Chapter
I, §11 of the Ohio Constitution. All regulations in this chapter are to be
construed, whenever possible, in favor of vigorous political debate and
accommodation of the rights of persons to speak freely.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1119.02 SUBSTITUTION AND PROTECTION CLAUSE.
   Wherever a sign with a commercial message is allowed or permitted under this
chapter, an owner may replace the message with a noncommercial message, subject
to the time, place and manner provisions of this chapter, without applying for
a permit and/or paying a fee that otherwise would be required for the placement
of a commercial message sign on the lot; provided, that the sign structure or
mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. This
provision prevails over any provision to the contrary in this chapter. The
purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial
speech over noncommercial speech or favoring of any particular noncommercial
message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a
right to increase the total amount of signage on a lot or parcel, nor does it
affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly
permitted.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1119.03 RECLASSIFICATION OF SIGNAGE.
   If the type of any sign that legally existed prior to the effective date of
this amendment is reclassified by this amendment, such sign shall be classified
as the sign type defined in this chapter and Chapter
1131: Definitions, and shall be subject to the applicable standards for such
sign type from the effective date of this amendment. Such reclassification
shall be regardless of any variances that were approved prior to the effective
date of this amendment.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1119.04 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   No person shall erect, place, relocate, expand, modify, maintain, or
otherwise alter a sign, or cause a sign to be erected, placed, relocated,
expanded, modified, maintained, or otherwise altered unless all provisions of
this code have been met.
   (b)   Unless otherwise provided, this chapter shall apply to any sign, in
any zoning district, that is visible from a public right-of-way or from an
adjacent property.
   (c)   Any sign legally established prior to the effective date of this
chapter, and which sign is rendered nonconforming by the provisions herein,
shall be subject to the nonconforming sign regulations of Section
 1119.11: Nonconforming Signs.
   (d)   Any person installing, structurally altering and/or relocating a sign
for which a permit has been issued shall be responsible for the scheduling of
necessary inspections, including, but not limited to, an inspection of footings
on a free-standing sign, building, and electrical inspections, etc., during the
course of the work.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1119.05 REVIEW AND PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   To ensure compliance with these regulations, a zoning permit shall be
required to be issued unless specifically exempted in this chapter.
   (b)   All signs related to a use or development that requires a site plan
review approval shall be required to be reviewed as part of the site plan
review application prior to issuance of a zoning permit.
   (c)   Zoning Permit Exemptions for Signs. The following signs are subject to
the requirements of this chapter but do not require a zoning permit. Permit-
exempt signs may still be subject to building code or other applicable code
requirements.
      (1)   Signs and/or notices issued by any court, officer, or other person
in performance of a public duty. Any such sign shall be removed no later than
seven (7) days after the last day it is required to be displayed;
      (2)   Whenever any sign, either conforming or nonconforming, is required
to be removed for the purpose of repair, relettering, or repainting, the same
may be done without a zoning permit or any payment of fees provided that all of
the following conditions are met.
      (3)   There is no alteration or remodeling to the structure or the
mounting of the sign itself;
      (4)   There is no enlargement or increase in any of the dimensions of the
sign or its structure;
      (5)   Whenever there is an exchange of sign panels when a sign is
designed to have replaceable sign faces;
      (6)   Signs that are an integral part of the original construction of
vending or similar machines, fuel pumps, automated teller machines or similar
devices that are not of a size or design as to be visible from a street or by
any person other than those using the machine or device;
      (7)   Any sign that is located completely inside a building that is not
visible from the exterior (see also definition of window sign);
      (8)   Signs that are located within a stadium, open-air theater, park,
arena or other outdoor use that are not visible from a public right-of-way or
adjacent property, and can be viewed only by persons within such stadium, open-
air theater, park, arena or other outdoor use;
      (9)   Certain temporary signs as established in Section
1119.10: Temporary Signs;
      (10)   No more than four flags located on flagpoles or on wall-mounted
posts provided that the following shall apply:
         A.   The maximum height of flag poles shall not exceed the maximum
building height for structures in the subject zoning district, and a maximum
sign area of area of forty (40) square feet for any individual flag attached to
the pole.
         B.   The maximum projection for a wall-mounted flag post is six (6)
feet and a maximum sign area of fifteen (15) square feet per flag.
      (11)   A single wall sign placed on the façade of an individual dwelling

      (12)   Signs that are an integral part of the historic character of a
structure that has been designated an official landmark or historic structure
by any agency or body of the governments of the United States, State of Ohio,
Lorain County or City of Sheffield Lake;
      (13)   Any signs located on umbrellas, seating, or similar patio
furniture;
      (14)   Ground signs and markings located completely within the interior

   1119.06 PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   The following types of signs are specifically prohibited within the City of
Sheffield Lake:
   (a)   Any sign that copies or imitates a sign installed by any governmental
agency or purports to have been authorized by a governmental agency;
   (b)   Signs that interfere with, obstruct the view of, or are similar in
appearance to any authorized traffic sign, signal, or device because of its
position, shape, use of words, or color;
   (c)   Signs that constitute a hazard to safety or health by reason of
inadequate or inappropriate design, construction, repair, or maintenance, as
determined by the building official;
   (d)   Signs that employ any parts or elements which revolve, rotate, whirl,

   (n)   Portable signs;
   (o)   Vehicle signs viewed from a public road with the primary purpose of
providing signage not otherwise allowed by this chapter. A vehicle sign shall
be considered to be used for the primary purpose of advertising if the vehicle
fails to display current license plates; if the vehicle is inoperable; or if
the sign alters the standard design of such vehicle. Vehicle signs include
those attached to or placed on a vehicle or trailer. Vehicles or trailers shall
not be parked continuously in one location to be used primarily as additional
signage. This does not apply to a vehicle parked at a driver's residence and is
the primary means of transportation to and from their place of employment; and
   (p)   Any sign not specifically allowed by this chapter.
      (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1119.07 MEASUREMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.
   (a)   Sign Setback. All required setbacks for signs shall be measured as the
distance in feet from the lot line or right-of-way, whichever is applicable, to
the closest point on the sign structure.
   (b)   Sign Height.
      (1)   The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade (average grade at the base of the sign) to the
top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of
any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating undertaken for the purpose of
locating or increasing the height of sign.
      (2)   The filling of a pre-existing hole or depression to create an
average grade at the same level as that surrounding the hole or depression is
permitted, provided such filling is allowed by other ordinances.
      (3)   In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level,
sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the
normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest
point of the crown of a public or private street. See
Figure 1119-A.

Figure 1119-A: Illustration of the measurement of sign height when the grade
at the bottom of the sign is below the grade of the adjacent street
      (4)   Any material whose major function is providing structural support
for a sign shall be considered part of the sign for purposes of determining
sign height.
      (5)   Where a distance is established for the clearance of a sign, such
measurements shall be made from the normal grade of the ground, directly under
the applicable sign or structure supporting the sign, and the bottom most point
of the sign or the structure supporting the sign, whichever is closest.
   (c)   Sign Area. The surface of a sign to be included when computing maximum
allowable square footage of sign area shall be calculated as established in
this section. For the purposes of calculating sign area, any of the following
regular geometric shapes may be used: circle, ellipse, triangle, square,
rectangle, trapezoid, pentagon, or hexagon.
      (1)   The calculation of sign area shall not include any supporting
framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall unless such structural support
is determined to constitute an integral part of the sign design by means of
text or other message, as determined by the Zoning Inspector. See
Figure 1119-B.
      (2)   For sign copy mounted or painted on a background panel, cabinet or
surface distinctively painted, textured, lighted or constructed to serve as the
background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by means of the
smallest permitted shape, or combination of permitted shapes, that encompasses
the extreme limits of the background panel, cabinet or surface. See
Figure 1119-B and
Figure 1119-C.

      (3)   For sign copy where individual letters or elements are mounted on a
building façade or window where there is no background panel, cabinet or
surface distinctively painted, textured, lighted, or constructed to serve as
the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by means of
the smallest permitted shape, or combination of permitted shapes, that encloses
all the letters or elements associated with the sign. See
Figure 1119-D.

Figure 1119-D: Illustration of sign area calculation for wall signs with
individual letters.
      (4)   In cases where there are multiple sign elements of sign copy on the
same surface, any areas of sign copy that are within two feet of one another
shall be calculated as a single sign area that shall be computed by means of
the smallest permitted shape, or combination of permitted shapes, that encloses
all sign copy within two feet of one another, otherwise the sign area shall be
computed for each separate piece of sign copy. See
 Figure 1119-E.

Figure 1119-E: Illustration of sign area calculations for multiple sign areas
on a window sign.
      (5)   Decorative edging or other window treatments that are not an
integral part of the sign copy shall not be considered a part of the sign for
the purposes of this chapter. See
Figure 1119-E.
      (6)   Except for three-dimensional signs, the sign area for a sign with
more than one face (multi-faced signs) shall be computed by adding together the
area of all sign faces when the interior angle is greater than forty-five (45)
degrees.
      (7)   When two identically sized, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back
or at angles of forty-five (45) degrees or less, so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any one point at the same time, the sign area shall be computed by
the measurement of one of the sign faces. If the two faces are unequal, the
sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two faces.
      (8)   In the case of a three-dimensional sign where the sign faces are
not mounted back-to-back, the sign area shall be calculated by the smallest
permitted shape, or combination of permitted shapes, that encompasses the
profile of the sign message multiplied by two. The profile used shall be the
largest area of the sign message visible from any one point.
   (d)   Façade Measurements.
      (1)   When calculating the permitted sign area based on the width of any
façade, such calculation shall be based on viewing the façade from a ninety
(90)-degree angle (i.e., straight on), regardless of façade insets, offsets, or
angles. See
Figure 1119-F.

shapes.
      (2)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased by a single occupant or tenant shall be considered a building unit.
The façade width for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.
      (3)   The primary facade shall be the portion of a frontage that serves
as the main access point to a building or building unit. A site or building
will be considered to have secondary facades when any of the following site/
building characteristics are present (See
Figure 1119-G.):
         A.   The subject site is a corner lot;
         B.   The primary parking area is not located adjacent to a public
street; or
         C.   The building or unit has walls with public or customer entrance
points that do not face the public street.

Figure 1119-G: Common examples of the location of primary and secondary
facades.
      (4)   When a site has primary and secondary facade as defined herein, the
Zoning Inspector shall determine which wall shall be the primary building
facade and which wall(s) shall be the secondary building facade. Only one
outside wall of any business shall be considered its primary facade.
      (5)   For multi-tenant buildings where each tenant has its own exterior
entrance, the portion of a building that is owned or leased by a single
occupant or tenant shall be considered a building unit. The façade width for a
building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party walls defining
the building unit. For uses, such as office buildings, where multiple tenants
may locate within the same building and all tenants have interior access to
their tenant space, such building shall be considered one building without
separate building units.
      (6)   The Zoning Inspector shall have the authority to make the
determination of what façades are primary facades and secondary façades for the
purposes of this chapter.
         (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)

subdivided or developed unless methods adequate to resolve the problems are
formulated by the developer and approved by City Council, upon recommendation
by the Planning Commission and upon advice of the Zoning Inspector.
      (4)   The natural topography shall be retained wherever possible in order
to reduce excessive runoff onto adjoining property and to avoid extensive
regrading of the site.
   (d)   Homeowners' or Property Owners' Associations.  See Section
1109.09: Homeowners' Association for requirements for homeowners' or property
owners' associations.
   (e)   Subdivision Names. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other

to curved street lines except where the Planning Commission determines that a
variation to this rule will provide a better street and sublot layout.
   (e)   Corner lots shall be of sufficient width to permit the required
building set-back line for each street the lot abuts.
   (f)   Flag (panhandle) lots or double frontage (through) lots shall be
discouraged and may only be approved if necessitated by unique features or
other special physical conditions as deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission. These lots shall meet the requirements established for the
applicable lot type in Section
1113.06(c).
   (g)   Every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a
reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for
all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1121.08 BLOCKS.
   (a)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria set forth in Section
1121.11: Streets and Thoroughfares and shall be arranged to accommodate lots
and building sites of the size and character required for the zoning district
as set forth in this code.
   (b)   Subdivisions shall be designed with blocks of sufficient width to
permit two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, to the maximum extent feasible.
   (c)   Where a subdivision adjoins a major thoroughfare, the block shall be
oriented so that there will be the fewest points of direct ingress and egress
along such major thoroughfare as possible.
   (d)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sac or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved if
properly designed and located, and if the maintenance of interior public spaces
is covered by agreements.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   
   1121.09 STREET LIGHTING.
   Street lighting for all new subdivisions within the City shall be provided
by the electric company, subject to the following provisions:

   Where railroads are involved, provision for grade separation, buffer strips
and other protective media shall be required to the extent and type as may be
practical.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1121.11 STREETS AND THOROUGHFARES.
   (a)   General Street Design.
      (1)   The arrangement, character, width, grade, construction and location
of all streets shall conform to the comprehensive land use plan, or other
applicable street plans, for the City that are in effect at the time of final
plat submission.
      (2)   The street layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of
land within the subdivision.
      (3)   The subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the
subdivision plat the necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance or
alignment of such streets in conformity with the comprehensive plan or other
applicable street plans.
      (4)   Offset streets shall be avoided whenever possible.
      (5)   Where practical, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining
areas.
      (6)   A street that is not constructed to City standards will not be
accepted by the City for dedication as a public street.
      (7)   Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as
to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient.
      (8)   A street that is not constructed to City standards will not be
accepted by the City for dedication as a public street.
      (9)   Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision which
would be subject to flooding. All streets must be located at elevations which
will make them flood-free, in order that no portion of the subdivision would
become isolated by floods.
      (10)   In the interest of public safety, and as a matter of policy, all
points of ingress and egress shall be located as far as possible from the
intersection of two or more major arterial streets or highways.
   (b)   Traffic Control Devices.  The subdivider shall provide all traffic
control devices for the proposed development, including, but not limited to,
traffic signals, signs, pavement markings and the like. Refer to the Ohio
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (OMUTC) for details of the devices to
be used, and, in some cases, warrants for their use.
   (c)   Street Signage.  All new subdivisions shall be required to install the
street signage within each phase on all public and private streets. The signage
shall be installed prior to acceptance by the City, and the road being open to
vehicular traffic. The signage must be shown on the improvement plans/site
plans as submitted for review by the Development Review Committee.
   (d)   Street Names and Numbering.
      (1)   Street names shall be selected that will not duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets in the City of Sheffield Lake and
in Lorain County, irrespective of modifying terms such as street, avenue,
boulevard, etc. Streets that are or will eventually be continuations of
existing or platted streets shall be named the same. Street names shall be
included on the preliminary plat and final plat.
      (2)   When a new street is a direct extension of an existing street, the
name shall remain the same.
      (3)   Address numbers shall be assigned by the City in accordance with
the current numbering system.
   (e)   General Street and Right-of-Way Design Standards.
      (1)   Proposed street classifications shall be designated (i.e., local,
principal collector, arterial, etc.) on all plats, based on their proposed
functions and the recommendation of any approved street plans. The physical and
geometric design of streets shall be based upon these designations in adapting
the proposed streets to the existing terrain and soils.
      (2)   The standards of the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), as published in A Policy on Geometric Design
of Highways and Streets, 1984; A Policy on Design Standards for Stopping Sight
Distances, 1971; and subsequent publications modifying those standards by
AASHTO, in effect at the time of final plat submission, shall govern the design
of subdivision streets and abutting City, county and township roads. The
"Desirable Sight Distance Values" will govern in all but the most unusual
instances, and any lesser values must be recommended by the City Engineer
before the preliminary design plan is approved by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   The pavement design shall be calculated and submitted by a
registered engineer with the preliminary plat approval.
      (4)   The subdivider shall be responsible for all required improvements,
including the required pavement width measured from back-to-back of curbs on an
undivided street. On a divided street, the subdivider shall be responsible for
the sidewalk, if required, one curb, one-half of the required pavement measured
to the back of the curb, and storm drainage.
      (5)   When developing along one side of an existing street or roadway
which is included in any approved street plans, the subdivider shall be
responsible for one curb, the pavement widening to thoroughfare width of his or
her side, all necessary adjustments to existing pavement, and storm drainage
for the street in accordance with an agreement with the City Engineer. Where
sight distances or other engineering requirements make it imperative, the
pavement adjustment responsibility shall include the replacement of up to the
entire existing pavement, also in accordance with an agreement with the City
Engineer.

      (7)   Vertical Alignment.
         A.   All changes in grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a
minimum length in feet equal to twenty (20) times the algebraic difference in
the rate of change of grade expressed in feet per 100 feet. Longer vertical
curves shall be used when needed for sight distances as determined by the
design engineer and approved by the City Engineer.
         B.   No street grade shall be less than 0.4 percent and on stop
streets, the grade shall not exceed two percent (2%) positive or three percent
negative within 100 feet of an intersection with local streets or 150 feet for
all other intersections, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. The
positive is considered going up from the intersection and the negative is going
down from the intersection.
         C.   Whenever the subdivider changes the grade of an existing street
outside the limits of the development, and the grade change requires adjustment
to meet existing improvements (streets, driveways, walks, and the like), such
adjustments are required will be the responsibility of the subdivider, as
approved by the City Engineer.
   (f)   Special Street Types and Street Requirements.  The following
requirements shall apply to special street types or under the specified
circumstances:
      (1)   Temporary Dead-End Streets.
         A.   Temporary dead-end streets shall be permitted only where there
are future plans to continue the street into another phase of the subdivision
or into an adjacent, future subdivision. In such cases, a temporary turnaround
shall be provided with a design approved by the City Engineer.
         B.   Provisions for maintenance and the removal of the temporary dead-
end street shall be required of any additional plat approvals.
         C.   Temporary dead-end streets longer than 600 feet are prohibited.
         D.   A "T" turnaround (temporary only) may be permitted in-lieu of a
cul-de-sac that is required for permanent dead-end streets. Such turnarounds
shall be designed to allow vehicles to turn around with only one backing-up
movement. See
Figure 1121-A. The turnaround area shall be the same width as the street it
abuts and shall be at least seventy-five (75) feet long.

Figure 1121-A: Illustrative example of a temporary "T" turnaround.
         E.   If a dead-end street extends one (1) lot depth or less past a
street intersection, a "T" turnaround will not be required.
      (2)   Permanent Dead-End Streets.
         A.   Permanent dead-end streets are prohibited unless they include a
turnaround (cul-de-sac) in accordance with this subsection.
         B.   Permanent dead-end streets shall not exceed 600 feet in length as
measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the center of the
turn-around. Permanent dead-end streets may be longer where unique topographic
or other physical conditions exist making a through street impractical.
         C.   All permanent dead-end streets shall be designed with a turning
circle having an outside pavement diameter (curb face to curb face) of at least
eighty (80) feet.
      (3)   Streets for Nonresidential Subdivisions.
         A.   Streets serving nonresidential developments (e.g., commercial or
industrial) and accessory parking areas shall be planned to connect with
collector or arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local access
streets.
         B.   The spacing of driveways serving nonresidential subdivisions is
established in the Section
1117.03(f).
         C.   The City Engineer may require local access streets (frontage
streets) that run parallel to an arterial or collector street to provide
maximum safety and convenience.
      (4)   Half-Streets.  The dedication of new half-streets shall not be
permitted. Where a dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the
tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted.
      (5)   Private Streets.
         A.   Private streets are discouraged.
         B.   Where constructed, a private street shall be constructed to the
minimum standard of a public street in accordance with this code.
         C.   The City shall not be responsible for maintenance, snow plowing,
cleaning, or provision of similar public street services for private streets.
         D.   Property owners abutting a private street may request that the
City accept the street as a public street dedication at a later date, but the
City shall not be required to accept such dedication.
         E.   In no instance shall the City accept a private street as a public
dedication until such street is shown to meet all applicable street design
standards required for public streets in this code.
            (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1121.12 UTILITIES.
   (a)   General Requirements for Utilities and Underground Facilities.
      (1)   All public and common electric, cable, and telephone lines and
other utilities shall be located underground in all residential, office,
commercial and industrial subdivisions and districts, and shall be placed in
their own easement, shown on the final or record plat. These underground
utility requirements shall also apply to any lines required to serve the new
development that extend outside the boundary of the development. The conduits
or cables shall be located within easements or public rights-of-way in separate
trenches, in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services.
      (2)   In industrial subdivisions where the electric power provider
advises the City that the power load requirements are sufficiently large as to
make underground service impractical or unfeasible, electric, cable, and
telephone lines may be installed overhead along rear lot lines with the
approval by the City Engineer. Should the City Engineer approve an overhead
distribution system, all connections to it shall be made underground. All
facilities are to be constructed on one side of the road without overhead
crossovers.
      (3)   Where cable, fiber optic, television, or similar services or
conduit is or will be in operation, the applicant shall install cable or
conduit for such service simultaneously with and in the same manner as electric
and telephone cables are installed, both within the right-of-way and to
individual building connections.
      (4)   All sewer and utility pipelines shall preferably be placed outside
the limits of the pavement. All excavations for public utilities made under
paved areas shall be properly backfilled with approved granular materials
thoroughly compacted in place and subject to approval by the City Engineer.
      (5)   All storm drainage grates shall be constructed to allow bicycles to
pass over the grate safely and shall have the words "No Dumping, Drains to
Stream", or similar, cast into the grate.
   (b)   Sanitary Sewers.  The following requirements shall govern sanitary
sewer improvements:
      (1)   Where an adequate existing public wastewater treatment system is
reasonably accessible, in the determination of the City Engineer, public
sanitary sewers shall be installed to adequately serve all lots, including
lateral connections to the public system. Public sewer system extensions shall
meet the requirements of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and City
standards.
      (2)   Combinations of sanitary sewers and storm sewers shall be
prohibited.
      (3)   Sanitary sewers shall be extended through all lots and rights-of-
way within the approved plat.
   (c)   Public Water Supply.  The following shall govern water supply
improvements:
      (1)   The subdivider or subdivider shall construct a system of water
mains and appurtenances and connect them with the public water supply and
provide a connection for each lot.
      (2)   The type, size, and location of water lines shall be approved by
the appropriate departments in the City of Sheffield Lake.
      (3)   Water mains shall be extended through all lots and rights-of-way
within the approved plat.
   (d)   Electric, Telephone, Cable, and Fiber Optic.
      (1)   Electric service and telephone service shall be provided within
each subdivision.
      (2)   Gas service and fiber optics shall be required where reasonably
accessible.       (3)   All electric, telephone, cable, fiber optic, and

CHAPTER 1125
Wireless Telecommunications
1125.01   Wireless telecommunication facilities.
1125.02   Use of public right-of-way for small cell wireless facilities and
wireless support structures.
   1125.01 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to provide for the common good and
preserve the enjoyment of private property through the regulation of the
construction, placement and modification of wireless telecommunications
systems, including telecommunications towers and associated facilities, while
ensuring the ability of the consumer to use and enjoy telecommunications
services of all types, and to protect the right of private and public
enterprise to exercise free trade.
      (2)   To the extent permitted by law, the City shall apply the
regulations set forth in this section to specifically accomplish the following:
         A.   Accommodate the need for wireless telecommunications towers and
facilities to meet the public's demand for the use and convenience of wireless
personal cellular telecommunications service and wireless internet access,
while regulating their location and number in the City;
         B.   To encourage the location of towers and facilities on
nonresidential land;
         C.   To minimize the total number of towers and facilities;
         D.   To ensure that towers and antennas are configured in such a way
as to minimize adverse visual impact by design, careful siting, landscape
screening, camouflaging and innovative techniques brought about through the
advance of science and technology;
         E.   To avoid damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through
competent engineering, construction and erection of towers;
         F.   To ensure that a competitive and broad range of wireless personal
communications services and high-quality telecommunications infrastructures are
provided to serve the residents, businesses, public sector and visitors to the
City;
         G.   To create and preserve a wireless telecommunications facilities
system which will serve as an effective part of the City's emergency response
network; and
         H.   To accommodate the public's demand for present day wireless
personal communications services through these standards, so that changing
technologies will continue to serve these needs, while concurrently preserving
the City's aesthetic and ecological integrity, so that residents of the future
may continue to enjoy the comfortable living standards of the Sheffield Lake
community.
   
   (b)   Location Criteria.
      (1)   Wireless telecommunications facilities, towers and related
structures may be located in any zoning district and located according to the
Official Zoning Map as a conditional use. Generally, wireless
telecommunications towers are objectionable in residential areas because their
use is industrial in nature, and may be objectionable in the community at large
because they are frequently considerably taller than surrounding structures,
causing them to be seen from long distances. Their location is therefore
regulated as permitted by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time
to time be amended.
      (2)   In order to accommodate the communications needs of residents and
businesses while protecting the health, safety and general welfare, the City
recommends and encourages the placement of wireless telecommunications
facilities and towers in nonresidential areas, in the following order of
preference:
         A.   City-owned property;
         B.   Industrial areas;
         C.   Other nonresidential districts deemed appropriate by review of
the Planning Commission and approval of Council.
      (3)   When a wireless telecommunications facility is located in
conformity with this chapter, and the antenna is collocated as herein defined,
and is attached to an institutional, recreational, public utility, office,
industrial or commercial structure or building, equipment and apparatus
supporting such facility shall be stored on the premises inside the wireless
telecommunications equipment building or other structure on the premises of the
facility.
   (c)   Towers.  In addition to the definitions set forth this code, "towers"
shall be regulated by this section.
      (1)   Towers Located in Nonresidential Zoning Districts.
         A.   A wireless telecommunications tower and related facilities are
permitted as the sole use on a zoning lot, and may be permitted, by approval of
the Planning Commission, on zoning lots containing other uses where existing
structures enable collocation, including on City owned property.
         B.   The minimum lot size on which a wireless telecommunications tower
and related facilities are placed shall be the minimum lot size required for
the underlying zoning district.
         C.   For purposes of this chapter only, any other provision of this
Code notwithstanding, the setback for a tower of any variety, including a
monopole, shall be measured from the base of the tower or monopole at the point
where it is placed in the ground to the property line, or to the nearest
residential dwelling located within the property and part of a multi-use non-
residentially zoned parcel. The exception to this regulation is where a tower,
monopole, antenna, whether camouflaged or not, or any apparatus defined herein
as a tower, is affixed to any existing building, and the use of it as a tower
for wireless telecommunications and wireless internet access is conditionally
approved by the Planning Commission.
            i.   An equipment building, and all other structures except the
tower, shall be set back the minimum distance required in the underlying zoning
district.
            ii.   In Industrial zoning districts, the setback for the tower
shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total height of the tower. A
minimum of fifty (50) feet shall be required.
            iii.   In nonindustrial zoning districts, excluding the conditions
listed in paragraphs
1125.01(c)(1)C.iv and
1125.01(c)(1)C.v hereof, the tower shall be set back fifty percent (50%) of the
total height of the tower. A minimum of fifty (50) feet shall be required.
            iv.   In nonindustrial zoning districts or in the Industrial zoning
districts where the lot on which a tower is located abuts another lot on which
is located, a school of any type, including institutions of higher learning
beyond high school level, public or private parks (but not including golf
courses), hospitals, playgrounds, day-care centers, health centers or other
human services and educational uses, as determined by the Planning Commission
to apply to this subsection, the tower shall be set back a distance equal to
the total height of the tower.
            v.   In nonindustrial zoning districts and in Industrial zoning
districts where a lot on which a tower is located abuts any lot within a
residential zoning district of any classification, the tower shall be set back
seventy-five percent (75%) of the total height of the tower. A minimum of
seventy-five (75) feet shall be required.
            vi.   Guyed wires may be anchored within the required setback area
only if the tower itself is placed in conformity with this chapter regarding
its setbacks, but guy wires and other similar supporting devices shall not be
anchored any less than ten (10) feet from any adjoining parcel or zoning lot,
regardless of its underlying zoning district.
      (2)   Towers in Residential Zoning Districts.
         A.   In order to locate wireless telecommunications towers and related
facilities in residential zoning districts, the applicant-service provider
shall demonstrate to the Planning Commission that there is sound geographic
reason for doing so, that offers to collocate with other providers within the
City or neighboring communities have proven ineffective, and that in order to
provide wireless telecommunications services to the residents and businesses in
such a manner which serves their best interests, such towers and facilities may
only be placed in a residential zoning district.
         B.   The setbacks for towers and related facilities in residential
zoning districts shall be the same as in nonresidential zoning districts,
pursuant to paragraph
1125.01(c)(1)C hereof.
         C.   Towers supporting amateur radio antennas and conforming to all
applicable provisions of this chapter shall be permitted in residential zoning
districts, but not as the sole use of a lot, and only in the rear yard of such
parcels, as defined in this Code.
         D.   The City, and any other governmental entity, may locate wireless
telecommunications towers and related facilities in residential zoning
districts, but only on publicly owned property, even as the sole use of the
lot.
            i.   The City may locate wireless telecommunications towers and
related facilities in residential zoning districts to provide wireless
telecommunications.
            ii.   The City may contract with private wireless
telecommunications service providers to locate a tower and related facilities
on City-owned property in residential zoning districts, provided that all
provisions of this chapter are followed.
         E.   In residential zoning districts, collocation shall be especially
encouraged.
         F.   In residential zoning districts, all towers shall be camouflaged
using the best and most advanced techniques possible, pursuant to Section
1125.01(g) unless waived by the Planning Commission for cause.
         G.   If wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities are
located in residential zoning districts, sufficient landscaping, buffering and/
or screening shall be required, and shall be considered paramount to the
establishment of such structures in all residential zoning districts. (See also
Section
 1125.01(d).)
         H.   Wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities are
permitted on land which has been established as permanent open space or a park,
subject to the following conditions:
            i.   The open space shall be owned and overseen by the City, the
County, the State, the United States of America, other governmental or quasi-
governmental agencies, a private homeowners association or a private, non-
profit conservation organization.
            ii.   If in a residential zoning district, the tower shall not
exceed 200 feet in height, including antennas.
            iii.   The wireless telecommunications equipment building shall not
exceed twenty (20) feet in height.
            iv.   The maximum size of the wireless telecommunications equipment
building shall be 300 square feet, or, if more than one is located on a given
zoning lot, 700 square feet in the aggregate.
            v.   Notwithstanding any other setback provisions of this chapter,
the tower shall be set back a minimum of 200 feet from any single-family
residential zoning district.
         I.   Towers and related wireless telecommunications facilities shall
be placed, constructed and modified subordinate and in deference to the use of
private, residentially zoned or used property, by minimizing the visual effect
on adjoining and vicinity residential properties, and to minimize the visual,
often unattractive, impact that towers and related wireless telecommunications
facilities create when viewing them from a distance.
      (3)   Design Requirements for Towers and Facilities.
         A.   Any wireless telecommunications tower shall be designed,
structurally and electrically, to accommodate both the applicant's antenna and
at least comparable antennas for at least two additional service providers if
the tower is at least 100 feet in total height, or for one additional service
provider if the tower is at least sixty (60) feet in total height. Towers shall
be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas on the tower and to
accept antennas mounted at various heights.
         B.   Towers and antennas, as well as all wireless telecommunications
facilities, shall be designed and situated upon a lot so as to minimize their
visibility and to the greatest extent possible to blend into the surrounding
environment.
         C.   Towers shall be designed, constructed, erected and maintained
with the utmost care for the safety of persons and property. Certification
attesting to the structural integrity of towers shall comply with the
provisions of Section
1125.01(e).
      (4)   Tower Height.
         A.   The maximum height of a tower shall be 200 feet unless a
technically logical reason for locating a higher tower is demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission and Council to be in order, on a case-
by-case basis, by the wireless telecommunications service provider making the
request. When a higher tower is required by provision of law consistent with
the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time to time be amended, the
provider shall submit written verification of such fact. Towers less than 200
feet in height are especially encouraged.
         B.   The physical ability to collocate antennas on any tower shall be
required on all towers higher than sixty (60) feet in height, unless it can be
demonstrated that, because of the type of tower involved for a given proposal
and/or for other technically logical reasons, the physical ability to collocate
on such a tower above sixty feet in height is not feasible or desired. A tower
100 feet or higher shall be designed to have sufficient structural capacity to
accommodate at least three additional providers.
      (5)   A tower and its related wireless telecommunications equipment
building and other structures, landscaping and other features, if any, shall be
located on a single zoning lot. The provider shall locate a tower and related
wireless telecommunications facilities only on a zoning lot of sufficient
dimensions and conditions to accommodate the overall facility, tower, etc., so
that all minimum setbacks and any other zoning requirements of the underlying
zoning district are met.
      (6)   Underground wireless telecommunications equipment buildings are
especially encouraged, especially on zoning lots in or abutting residential
zoning districts where a tower is placed.
   (d)   Additional Regulations. The provisions of this section pertain to
towers and all other wireless telecommunications facilities and structures, and
shall be in addition to the regulations set forth in Section
1125.01(c).
      (1)   All towers and related wireless telecommunications facilities shall
be located in a landscaped setting. A landscaped buffer area of not less than
ten (10) feet in depth shall be placed between the wireless telecommunications
facility and the public right-of-way, residential zoning district and any
adjacent residential use, regardless of the underlying zoning district thereof.
Such buffer area shall, at a minimum, consist of dense foliage and vegetation,
of at least partially evergreen species, not less than the height of any
equipment proposed for the site but not less than eight feet in height.
Landscaping shall be continuously maintained and promptly reconditioned, if
necessary. Other landscaping may be required by the Planning Commission. The
arrangement of landscaping and the overall design thereof within a zoning lot
on which a wireless telecommunications tower and related facility is placed may
be considered by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Screened fencing shall be provided for appearance, public safety
and personal security, according to the following requirements:
         A.   Height.
            i.   The minimum height of any fencing shall be three (3) feet.
            ii.   The maximum height in any residential zoning district shall
be six (6) feet.
            iii.   The maximum height in any nonresidential zoning district
shall be eight (8) feet.
         B.   In any zoning district, the screened fencing shall consist of a
chain link fence, as defined in this code for the underlying zoning district.
Fencing in an industrial zoning district may be capped with barbed wire to a
maximum of twelve (12) inches. The barbed wire portion, if any, shall be
included in the measurement of the total height of such fencing.
         C.   Fencing may be unpainted or painted to blend into the surrounding
area.
         D.   Access to the tower and related wireless telecommunications
facility shall only be through a locked gate, properly maintained and secured
twenty-four hours per day. The City shall not be responsible for any damage to
the tower or other auxiliary structures, and shall be held harmless from any
liability of any kind relating to damage, destruction, misfeasance of the tower
or auxiliary structures, and from any personal injury to any party whomever.
      (3)   Except as required by law or safety factors as determined by the
City, an antenna or tower shall not be illuminated and lighting fixtures or
signs, other than those sanctioned by this chapter, shall not be attached to an
antenna or tower. Security lighting shall be permitted for the wireless
telecommunications equipment building and other auxiliary structures, if any.
Any permitted lighting shall be situated and directed so as not to emit light
directly or indirectly onto any adjoining residential property, and in any
zoning district, such lighting shall be designed, placed, and directed to
minimize its emission and glare onto any adjoining property.
      (4)   A tower or related wireless telecommunications facility shall
contain no symbols whatever. The fencing surrounding the wireless
telecommunications equipment building shall contain the appropriate number of
signs to warn the public of danger and also at least two signs stating "NO
TRESPASSING", and a sign identifying the wireless telecommunications service
provider, of a type, size, color and allotment as approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (e)   Certification of a Registered Structural Engineer.  Prior to approval
of a site plan to construct and locate a wireless telecommunications tower and
related facility, an independent certified structural engineer shall be engaged
by the City, whose services shall be paid for in total by the applicant. The
City may pay for such services in advance for the purpose of timeliness and
invoice the applicant for charges. The applicant shall reimburse the City in
full within thirty (30) days of receipt of such invoice. The applicant may also
be responsible for obtaining independent opinions of other technical experts
for the purpose of verifying the safety and structural integrity of towers and
other wireless telecommunications facilities, including, but not limited to,
representatives of the FCC, the FAA and a person qualified to certify the
safety of and comment upon radio frequency emission, in a manner as determined
acceptable to the City, as directed by the Planning Commission.
   (f)   Registration of Wireless Telecommunications Providers. All wireless
telecommunications services providers, including governmental, public and
quasi-public providers, who operate or propose to operate within the corporate
limits of the City, shall register with the Zoning Inspector on forms and in a
manner as prescribed by the Zoning Inspector. At a minimum, the following
information shall be required:
      (1)   The identity and legal status of the provider, including business
affiliations.
      (2)   The name, address, telephone number, fax number and electronic mail
address (if available), of the officer, agent or employee responsible for the
accuracy of the registration statement. It shall be the responsibility of the
provider to keep this information up to date.
      (3)   A narrative and map description of all the provider's existing or
proposed wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities in the City
and elsewhere.
      (4)   A description of the wireless telecommunications and related
facilities in the City and elsewhere.
      (5)   Written information sufficient into the opinion of the Planning
Commission to verify that the provider has applied for and received
certification and approval as a licensed wireless telecommunications provider
by the FCC to operate in the State.
      (6)   Any other information reasonably related to the application and the
probable, substantive effects of locating a wireless telecommunications tower
and related facility in the City, as may be required by the Planning
Commission.
   (g)   Design Criteria.
      (1)   Camouflaging of Towers.
         A.   Towers shall be located in a landscaped setting pursuant to
Section
1125.01(d)(1). The Planning Commission may require additional landscaping.
Camouflaging of towers is especially encouraged only if logical and technically
feasible. Such camouflaging may take the form of erecting a tower which
resembles or mimics another object, such as a tree or flag pole. Camouflaging
may also consist of placing antennas on existing structures such as water
towers or buildings in such a way that they are not easily detected and cannot
be seen by the naked eye from a long distance.
         B.   If antennas are collocated on existing structures which are not
towers as defined by this chapter, it shall be presumed that such antennas are
camouflaged unless their positioning and placement causes them to be easily
seen and discerned by a reasonable person as being wireless telecommunications
antennas.
         C.   Antennas may be placed on trees, if technically feasible, and is
such placement would provide wireless telecommunications services to the
residents and businesses of the City equal to that if such antennas were placed
on towers. If antennas are placed on trees, they shall be camouflaged.
         D.   A building or other structure may be a prop only, which is unused
and unusable as anything but a device to camouflage an antenna. It shall be
aesthetically pleasing and maintained continuously.
         E.   Camouflaging, whatever variety and however employed, shall be of
a type compatible with the immediate surrounding area and the City at large in
color, design, material, appearance and its method of mimicry. For example, an
artificial oak tree 100 feet in height would satisfy this requirement. An
artificial palm tree would not.
         F.   Antennas may be placed on facades of buildings if colored and
designed to match the color, texture and style of the building to which it is
attached, and shall be attached at least twenty-five (25) feet above grade.
      (2)   Color of Towers. All towers of any type shall be of a color which
blends into the natural color of the immediate area or skyline, but shall not
be painted at all if, by coloring the tower, it would be more visible to the
naked eye from a long distance than if it were erected in the ordinary tone of
it construction materials, such as the grayish color of galvanized steel. If
towers are painted, they shall be maintained within the requirements of the
City's property maintenance ordinance.
      (3)   Historic Districts. In any district which shall become so
demarcated as a historically and/or architecturally significant district, or as
a special district recognized and set apart as significant to the community's
heritage or traditions, wireless telecommunications towers and related
facilities shall not be located, unless it is proven that in order to provide
wireless telecommunications service, such towers or facilities may not be
located elsewhere within the City. Any tower and related wireless
communications facility, including the equipment building, shall be camouflaged
in such districts as herein described. Prior to approval, the provider shall
demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that if towers and related
wireless telecommunications facilities are located in districts as herein
described, they shall not adversely affect the natural or man-made environment
or the architectural setting, and that their location shall not pose any
reasonable risk to the health and safety of residents within 300 feet of the
boundaries of a district as herein described.
      (4)   Towers of Excessive Height. Wireless telecommunications towers
higher than 200 feet or located within 2,500 feet of any airport runway, public
or private, shall be registered with the FAA. The provider/operator of such
tower shall submit written verification of such registration with the FAA.
Lighting shall be required for that part of towers in excess of 200 feet or as
otherwise required by the FAA. When such lighting is required by the FAA or
other governmental authority, and the zoning lot on which a tower is located
abuts any residential zoning district, it shall be oriented inward of the
zoning lot and shall not project or be cast onto all abutting zoning lots
within residential zoning districts.
      (5)   National Environmental Protection Act.  The location, construction
and operation of towers and related wireless telecommunications facilities
shall comply with all applicable requirements and laws of the National
Environmental Protection Act, Chapter 19, as may from time to time be amended.
      (6)   Advertising and Identification.
         A.   Identification of towers and related wireless telecommunications
facilities shall be permitted if required by the FCC, the FAA, the Federal or
State EPA, OSHA or other governmental agency for regulation or identification
purposes as necessary pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may
from time to time be amended, or other applicable law. The City shall be
permitted to require identification signs.
         B.   No advertising whatever shall be permitted on towers or related
wireless telecommunications facilities, unless required as indicated in
paragraph A hereof or by other action of law. The only signs permitted shall be
those signs indicating danger and no trespassing signs, or other signs
important to the identification of the tower or facility as determined by the
Zoning Inspector and/or the Planning Commission. All such signs shall be
permanently attached to the tower or other wireless telecommunications
structure and shall be placed at least four (4) feet above grade. The only
colors permitted shall be black, white, red, yellow, orange or any combination
of these colors. Signs shall not be illuminated in any manner. Luminous paint
may be used on signs if approved by the Zoning Inspector and/or the Planning
Commission.
   (h)   Streets and Parking.
      (1)   All zoning lots on which are located towers and related wireless
telecommunications facilities shall abut a public right-of-way.
      (2)   The type and construction of such roads shall be regulated as
otherwise set forth in this code.
      (3)   If available, existing parking shall be used and not expanded. Each
zoning lot on which is located a tower and related wireless telecommunications
facility shall have sufficient parking to accommodate service of the site. A
minimum of one (1) parking space and a maximum of three (3) parking spaces
shall be provided. Parking shall appear on the site plan for the wireless
telecommunications facility as regulated by this code.
      (4)   If the wireless telecommunications facility is fully automated, a
maximum of two (2) parking spaces shall be required for maintenance workers. If
the site is not fully automated, a maximum of three parking spaces shall be
permitted. Parking specifications shall be as regulated in this code.
   (i)   Accessory Buildings. All accessory or utility buildings and structures
that are not a tower or related wireless telecommunications facility as defined
in this chapter shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the
surrounding area and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the
underlying zoning district. Landscaping and other regulations of this chapter
shall also apply. Ground-mounted equipment shall be screened from view by
suitable vegetation, except where a design of nonvegetative screening better
reflects and complements the surrounding neighborhood.
   (j)   Demonstration of Necessity.
      (1)   To assure that the City's and the public's objectives are achieved,
the wireless telecommunications service provider requesting permission to
locate a tower and related wireless telecommunications facility shall produce
written evidence of contact with all wireless telecommunications service
providers who supply service within the distribution sphere of the proposed
facility. The applicant-provider shall inquire about potential collocation
opportunities at all technically feasible locations in, or which could service,
the City.
      (2)   To adequately demonstrate the need at a particular location the
applicant-provider shall provide following information as part of the
demonstration of necessity:
         A.   Coverage areas of existing sites within 2.5 miles;
         B.   Propagation maps from proposed site at increments of twenty-five
(25) feet starting at fifty (50) feet in height up to proposed height;
         C.   List of existing structures within 2.0 miles of proposed site
that are at least forty (40) feet in height along with anticipated signal
strengths from those structures;
         D.   In-building and in-vehicle coverage areas in relation to
paragraph (b)(2) above;
         E.   Description of anticipated coverage areas and coverage signal
strengths in dBm;
         F.   Written proof of contact with existing wireless telecommunication

CHAPTER 1127
Nonconformities
1127.01   Purpose.
1127.02   General provisions.
1127.03   Determination of nonconformity status.
1127.04   Nonconformities and variances.
1127.05   Nonconforming uses.
1127.06   Nonconforming structures and sites.
1127.07   Nonconforming lots of record.
1127.08   Nonconforming signs.
1127.09   Nonconforming fences and walls.
 
   1127.01 PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this code, some lots, uses of lands or
structures, or combinations thereof may exist which were lawful prior to the
effective date or amendment of this code, but that are prohibited, regulated,
or restricted under the terms of this code. The legitimate interest of those
who lawfully established these nonconformities are herein recognized by
providing for the continuance of such uses, subject to regulations limiting
their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution.
Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this code that such nonconformities be
allowed to continue until removed, they should not be encouraged to survive,
unless otherwise allowed in this chapter or specifically addressed in this
code. (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1127.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   The lawful use of any use, building, structure, or of any land or
premises as existing and lawful at the time of enactment of this code may be
continued although such use, building, structure, or of any land does not
conform to the provisions of this code.
   (b)   Passage of this code in no way legalizes any illegal uses existing at
the time of its adoption.
   (c)   An applicant for any development review that includes a nonconformity
shall bear the burden of proof in demonstrating that the use was a legal
nonconformity on the effective date of this code.
   (d)   Repair and Maintenance.
      (1)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing
a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that
the footprint and height of the structure as it existed, when it became
nonconforming, shall not be increased unless in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to safe condition of any building, or part thereof,
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official. Where appropriate, a building permit for
such activities shall be required.
   (e)   Unless otherwise stated, whenever this section calls for review and/or
a decision by the BZBA, such review shall be the variance procedure including
the application of public hearing notification and review criteria.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1127.03 DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMITY STATUS.
   (a)   At the time of application for a zoning permit, building permit, or
request for variance, as applicable, regarding a nonconforming lot, building,
structure or use, the property owner shall submit sufficient evidence for the
Zoning Inspector or BZBA, as applicable, to determine that such lot, building,
structure, or use was lawfully created or established in accordance with the
zoning regulations in existence at that time.
   (b)   If the evidence submitted indicates the lot, building, structure or
use was legally established and has since become nonconforming because of the
establishment of or amendment to this code, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a
zoning permit or building permit, as applicable, identifying it as a legal
nonconformity. A copy of such certificate shall be kept on file in the City
offices.
   (c)   The City may also issue a zoning or building permit if the Zoning
Inspector, Planning Commission, or BZBA finds that the use, building, or
structure existed prior to the adoption of the code in 1962, or any subsequent
amendment during their applicable reviews.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1127.04 NONCONFORMITIES AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use,
such use shall no longer be defined as a nonconforming use nor shall the
property be returned to the former nonconforming use.
   (b)   The granting of a variance for a use that otherwise complies with this
code, shall not create a nonconformity when the variance is granted.
   (c)   When a property owner or authorized agent is granted a variance for a
nonconformity that addresses the nonconformity, the use, structure, or lot,
shall no longer be considered nonconforming.
   (d)   If a property owner or authorized agent is granted a variance for a
nonconformity that addresses some nonconformities but additional
nonconformities continue, the use, structure, or lot shall still be subject to
the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1127.05 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this code, lawful uses of land or
structures exist that would not be permitted by the regulations of this code,
the uses may be continued, changed, or expanded so long as they remain
otherwise lawful and provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land that was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code unless it complies with the
provision of Section
1127.05(e): Expansion of a Nonconforming Use.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment if this zoning code.
   (c)   No additional structures shall be constructed on a lot with a
nonconforming use unless such new structure complies with the requirements of
this code and the applicable zoning district.
   (d)   Change or Substitution of Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use of a building, structure, or land shall not be
changed or substituted to another nonconforming use unless the BZBA finds that
the use proposed is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district
than the existing nonconforming use, and that the use proposed is in less
conflict with the character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district
than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change or substitution,
the BZBA may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
other provisions of this code.
      (2)   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive use,
such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive nonconforming use.
   (e)   Expansion of a Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions to the contrary, the
usable area of a nonconforming residential use may be increased or improved,
regardless of the applicable zoning district.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions to the contrary, the
usable area of a nonconforming, nonresidential use may be increased or
improved, regardless of the applicable zoning district, where the owner of such
use can demonstrate through application to the BZBA that the manner in which
the useable area of the nonconforming use will be increased or improved will
have minimal adverse impact upon adjacent properties and other permitted land
uses in the surrounding neighborhood or can be made compatible with the
adjacent properties and the uses in the surrounding neighborhood upon
compliance with specified conditions.
      (3)   Variances to expand a nonconforming use into a required setback or
to otherwise vary a regulation that applies to the subject site shall be
prohibited.   
   (f)   Existing Use Reclassified as a Conditional Use. In the event an
existing use that was permitted by right at the time the use was established is
thereafter reclassified as a conditional use for applicable district due to a
zoning text amendment, such use shall be considered to be an approved
conditional use without any further action. However, any subsequent change to
such use shall require review and approval by the BZBA in accordance with this
chapter.
   (g)   Termination of Nonconforming Uses.
      (1)   Termination of Use through Discontinuance. When any nonconforming
use is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for one (1) year or more, any new
use shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of
the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed. The intent to continue a nonconforming use shall not be
evidence of its continuance.
      (2)   Termination of Use by Damage or Destruction.
         A.   If a nonconforming residential use in any district is damaged or
destroyed to any extent, such structure and use may be reestablished, restored,
or reconstructed on the same lot. Such reestablishment, restoration, or
reconstruction of the use shall require the issuance of a zoning permit.
         B.   If any nonconforming nonresidential use is damaged, but not to an
extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of the principal structure's
replacement cost, such structure and use may be reestablished, restored, or
reconstructed on the same lot to the same size and intensity of use as was
previously existing immediately prior to the damage or destruction. Such
reestablishment, restoration, or reconstruction of the use shall require the
issuance of a zoning permit.
         C.   If any nonconforming nonresidential use is damaged beyond fifty
percent (50%) of the principal replacement cost, such structure and use may
only be reestablished, restored, or reconstruction with approval by the BZBA
after consideration of surrounding uses and the impact of the nonconforming
use.
         D.   The determination of the replacement cost shall be determined by
an independent commercial appraisal firm, or bank, appointed by the Zoning
Inspector and the President of Council and which appraisal cost will be paid
for by the applicant at the time the building permit is applied for.
            (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1127.06 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND SITES.
   A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied by
a use permitted applicable zoning district so long as it remains otherwise
lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)   Any nonconforming structure or site may be enlarged, maintained,
repaired, or altered provided, however, no such enlargement, maintenance,
repair or alteration shall either create an additional nonconformity or
increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such
structure or site, unless otherwise specified in this code.
   (b)   A nonconforming structure shall not be relocated in whole or in part
to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure
shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the applicable zoning district
after being relocated.
   (c)   The principal use of a nonconforming building may be changed to any
other use permitted in the applicable zoning district as long as the new use
complies with all regulations of this code specified for such use, except the
regulations to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (d)   The governmental acquisition of a portion of a lot for a public
purpose that results in reduction in a required yard or building setback below
that required in the applicable zoning district shall not render a structure
nonconforming.
   (e)   Damage or Destruction of a Nonconforming Structure Containing a
Conforming Use.
      (1)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged, but not to an extent
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the principal structure's replacement cost,
such structure and use may be reestablished, restored, or reconstructed on the
same lot to the same size and intensity of use as was previously existing
immediately prior to the damage or destruction. Such reestablishment,
restoration, or reconstruction shall require the issuance of a zoning permit.
      (2)   If any nonconforming nonresidential use is damaged beyond fifty
percent (50%) of the principal replacement cost, such structure and use may
only be reestablished, restored, or reconstruction with approval by the BZBA
after consideration of surrounding uses and the impact of the nonconforming
structure or site.
      (3)   The determination of the replacement cost shall be determined by an
independent commercial appraisal firm, or bank, appointed by the Zoning
Inspector and the President of Council and which appraisal cost will be paid
for by the applicant at the time the building permit is applied for.
      (4)   If an owner rebuilds a legally nonconforming structure, they may
expand the structure provided any expansion or change does not increase the
nonconformity that existed prior to the damage.
      (5)   If the owner voluntarily removes the structure or reduces the
nonconformity, that owner shall not be permitted to rebuild the structure to
the original height, size, or setback and shall be required to bring the
structure into compliance with these regulations to the maximum extent
feasible. (Ord. 26-22. Passed 4-26-22.)
   1127.07 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   A nonconforming lot of record may be used in accordance with this section.
   (a)   Nonconforming Lots of Record in Residential Districts.
      (1)   If an existing lot of record in residential district is occupied by
a dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized
or altered, provided that:

enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this code, with the
exception of the lot area and the lot width regulations.
         B.   The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless in
conformance with this code.
         C.   Dwelling units may be expanded without requiring any additional
garage space or parking space provided the addition does not occupy space that
could be used for parking or a garage in compliance with these regulations.
      (2)   In any residential district, a single-family dwelling and its
customary accessory uses may be erected on a vacant single lot of record after
the effective date of this code provided the buildings comply with the
following:
         A.   The width of the side yard of any such lot need not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the width of the lot, provided, however, that there shall be a
minimum side yard setback of five (5) feet.

percent (20%) of the depth of the lot, provided, however, that the minimum rear
yard setback shall be ten (10) feet.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lots of Record in Nonresidential Districts. In any
nonresidential district, a use that is permitted in the applicable district,
and its customary accessory uses, may be erected on a vacant single vacant lot
of record provided the buildings comply with the following:

   (c)    No owner shall proceed with the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building until the plans or drawings, specifications, and
data have been approved as this section requires, or the industrialized unit
inspected at the point of origin. No plans or specifications shall be approved
or inspection approval given unless the building represented would, if

of the Revised Code and any rule made under those chapters.
(Ord. 29-10. Passed 6-22-10.)

serious hazard, such hazard shall be eliminated or the building shall be
vacated, and where such building, when vacated, remains a serious hazard, it
shall be razed.
   (f)    Orders, injunction proceedings. Where the building official finds

the time specified in an order from the building official, to eliminate such
hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (g)    Restoration. Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the building official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe
condition. To the extent that repairs, alterations or additions are intended to
be made or a change of occupancy occurs during the restoration of the
structure, such repairs, alterations, additions or change of occupancy shall
comply with Chapter 34 and this chapter.

preparations or structure to be constructed, or the installation of an
industrialized unit, or the use of an appliance, material, assemblage, or
manufactured product does not comply with Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or
the rules adopted pursuant to those chapters. The effect of such an order shall
be limited to the matter specified therein.
   (b)    Any adjudication order shall specify what appliances, site
preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans, materials,
assemblages, or procedures are necessary for    compliance with Ohio R.C.

shall cease using the appliance, materials, assemblages, or manufactured
product identified in the order until the appeal provided for in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 3781.19, and all appeals from the hearing have been completed,

hearing may appeal to the court of common pleas of the county in which the
party is a resident or in which the premises affected by the order is located.
The court shall not be confined to the record as certified to it by the agency
but any party may produce additional evidence and the court shall hear the
matter upon the record and additional evidence any party introduces. The court
shall not affirm the agency's order unless the preponderance of the evidence
before it supports the reasonableness and lawfulness of the order and any rule
of the board of building standards upon which the order is based in its
application to the particular set of facts or circumstances involved in the
appeal.
   (e)    Failure to cease work after receiving a stop work order is hereby
declared a public nuisance.

1301.08 CONFLICT.
   (a)    General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code
specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the
most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general
requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be
applicable.
   (b)    Other laws. The provisions of this code shall not be deemed to
nullify any provisions of state or federal law. Municipal corporations may make
further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C. Chapters
3781 and 3791 or with the rules of the board of building standards. However
approval by the board of building standards of any fixture, device, material,
system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or manner of
construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use anywhere
in Ohio.
   (c)   Other rules. As provided in Ohio R.C. 3781.11(B), the rules of the
board of building standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the divisions of state fire marshal or industrial compliance in the
department of commerce, and the department of health and of counties and
townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict
with the rules of the board of building standards, except that rules adopted
and orders issued by the fire marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 3743
prevail in the event of a conflict.
   The rules of the board of building standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3781.10 shall govern any rule or standard adopted by the board pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 4104.02 and 4105.011.
(Ord. 29-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1301.09  ENFORCEMENT.

and moving of buildings and structures.
            (A)   Plan examination by the building official. When the building
department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified building official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
         (ii)   Orders. The building official shall issue all orders in
accordance with section 109 to ensure compliance with this code.

repair, alteration, relocating, or equipment of a building are subject to
inspection by the building official, under section 108, the building official
shall cause to be made such inspections, investigations, and determinations as
are necessary to determine whether or not the work which has been performed and
the installations which have been made are in conformity with the approved
construction documents.
            Exception: Special inspections required under section 1704.
         (iv)   Department records. The building official shall keep official
records of applications received, certificate of plan approvals issued, notices
and orders issued, certificates of occupancy, and other such records required
by the rules of the board of building standards. Such information shall be
retained in the official permanent record for each project. One set of approved
construction documents shall be retained by the building official for a period
of not less than one hundred eighty days from date of completion of the
permitted work, or as required by document retention regulations.
      (2)   Inspectors. An inspector is responsible for performing inspections
and determining that work, for which they are certified to make inspections, is
performed in compliance with the approved construction documents. All
inspectors shall inspect the work to the extent of the approval given when
construction documents were approved by the building official and for which the
inspection was requested. All inspectors shall effectively communicate the
results of their inspections as required by section 108, and shall conduct
themselves in a professional, courteous, impartial, responsive, and cooperative
manner.
         (i)   Building inspector. A building inspector is responsible to
determine compliance with the approved construction documents in accordance
with section 108.
         (ii)   A building inspector trainee is designated to determine
compliance with approved construction documents, in accordance with section
108, under the direct supervision of an individual holding a building inspector
certification.
      (3)   Liability. Liability of certified building department personnel for
any tortuous act will be determined by Ohio courts to the applicable provisions
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2744.
   
   (c)    Certified boards of building appeals duties and responsibilities.
Before performing its duties, a jurisdiction wishing to establish a local board
of building appeals shall receive certification by the board of building
standards as required in section 103.14.

county boards of building appeals shall hear and decide the adjudication
hearings referred to in section 109.1 within the jurisdiction of and arising
from orders of the local building official in the enforcement of Ohio R.C.
Chapters 3781 and 3791 and rules adopted thereunder. The orders may be reversed
or modified by the board if it finds:
      (1)    The order contrary to such laws or rules;
      (2)   The order contrary to a fair interpretation or application thereof;
or
      (3)   That a variance from the provisions of such laws or rules, in a
specific case, will not be contrary to the public interest where literal
enforcement of such provisions will result in unnecessary hardship.
   (e)    Materials. A certified board of building appeals may not prohibit the
use of materials or assemblages authorized for statewide use by the board of
building standards pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3781.12.
(Ord. 29-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1301.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter or any Code adopted herein or
fails to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months or both. Each day
during which noncompliance or a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense. The Municipality may institute injunction proceedings in Common Pleas

work order as referred to in Section
1301.07 .

   (b)   Extent of use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   This code does not prevent a local governing authority from adopting
additional regulations governing residential structures if the regulations
comply with this section.
   (a)   A local governing authority shall, and any person may, notify the
board of building standards of any regulation the local governing authority
adopts related to content within the scope of this code and request that the
board of building standards determine whether that regulation conflicts with
the state residential building code.
      (1)   Not later than sixty days after receiving a notice to review local
regulations for conflict, the board shall determine, based upon a
recommendation from the advisory committee, whether the regulation conflicts
with the state residential building code and shall notify any person who
submitted the notice and the local governing authority that adopted the
regulation of the board's determination.
      (2)   If the board determines that a conflict does not exist, the board
shall take no further action with regard to the regulation. If the board
determines a conflict exists and the regulation is not necessary to protect the
health or safety of the persons within the local governing authority's
jurisdiction, the regulation is not valid and the local governing authority may
not enforce the regulation.
      (3)   If the board determines that a conflict exists and that the
regulation is necessary to protect the health or safety of the persons within
the local governing authority's jurisdiction, the board shall adopt a rule to
incorporate the regulation into the state residential building code. Until the
rule becomes a part of the state residential building code, the board shall
grant a temporary variance to the local governing authority and any similarly
situated local governing authority to which the board determines the temporary
variance should apply.
         (Ord. 30-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1303.04 COMPLIANCE.
   (a)    No architect, engineer, builder, plumber, carpenter, mason,
contractor, subcontractor, foreman, or employee shall violate or assist in the
violation of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Revised Code or rules or regulations
adopted pursuant thereto or of any order issued thereunder.
   (b)    No owner shall proceed with the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building until the plans or drawings, specifications, and
data have been approved as this section requires, or the industrialized unit
inspected at the point of origin. No plans or specifications shall be approved
or inspection approval given unless the building represented would, if
constructed, repaired, erected, or equipped, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791
of the Revised Code and any rule made under those chapters.
(Ord. 30-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1303.05 EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   The provisions of section 115 shall control the alteration, repair,
addition, and change of occupancy of any existing structure. The occupancy of
any structure currently existing on the date of adoption of this code shall be
permitted to continue without change provided the alleged occupancy can be
shown to have existed and there are no orders of the building official pending,
no evidence of fraud, or no serious safety or sanitation hazard. Buildings
constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved prior to the
effective date of this code are existing buildings.
(Ord. 30-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1303.06 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)     Adjudication Orders, Required Before Legal Proceedings. Before any
department or any political subdivision attempts to enforce this code by any
remedy, civil or criminal, it shall issue an adjudication order within the
meaning of sections 119.06 to 119.13 of the Revised Code or a stop work order
as provided in section 114. Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what
appliances, site preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans,
materials, assemblages or procedures are necessary for the same to comply with
this code.
      (2)   Include notice to the party of the procedure for appeal and right
to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice. The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing, the party may be
represented by counsel, present arguments or contentions orally or in writing,
and present evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against the party.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. The residential building official is authorized
to serve a notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the
erection, construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal,
demolition or occupancy of a residential building or structure. When the
residential building official finds that work or equipment is contrary to
approved residential construction documents and the rules of the board, the
residential building official shall send a notice in writing to the owner of
said residential building or the owner's agent which shall state where and in
what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the approved plans for
same and the rules of the board. The notice shall specify a reasonable period
of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the board.
   Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration, or
equipment of any residential building for which the approval is invalid, the
owner of the residential building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and
specifications for approval as required under section 105.3.
   (c)    Prosecution of violation. Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or in section 114, the person receiving an order shall cease
work upon the site preparations or structure to be constructed or shall cease
using the appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified
in the order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of section 3781.19 of the Revised Code, and all appeals from such
hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
   (d)    Failure to File Construction Documents, Penalty. When an owner fails
to file residential construction documents as required by this code and fails
to comply with an adjudication order issued under section 113.1, said owner may
be prosecuted and is subject to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars as
provided for in section 3791.04 of the Revised Code.
   (e)    Failure to Comply with Order to Conform to Construction Documents,
Remedy. If an owner fails to comply with an order issued by the residential
building official, and fails to comply with an adjudication order issued under
section 113.1 and the time of appeal has expired, then the residential
construction documents required under section 3791.04 of the Revised Code are
deemed not to have been filed and approved, and the conditions of section 113.4
apply.
(Ord. 30-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1303.07 STOP WORK.
   (a)    Authority. Whenever any work regulated by this code is being
performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this code or in a dangerous
or unsafe manner, the residential building official is authorized to issue a
stop work order whenever the building official finds, after inspection, that
the site preparations, structure being constructed, the use of an appliance,
materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with the
provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Revised Code or this code. The
effect of such an order shall be limited to the matter specified in the order.
   (b)    Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner's agent and the person
doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance. No person shall continue any work after having
been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed
to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition. Failure to cease work
after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public nuisance.
(Ord. 30-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1303.08 CONFLICTS.
   (a)    General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code
specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the
most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general
requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be
applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of this code shall not be deemed to nullify
any provisions of state or federal law. An approval by the board of building
standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Rules of the Board. The rules of the board of building standards shall
supersede and govern any order, standard, or rule of the division of the fire
marshal or industrial compliance in the department of commerce, and the
department of health and of counties and townships, in all cases where such
orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the rules of the board of
building standards, except that rules adopted and orders issued by the fire
marshal pursuant to Chapter 3743 of the Revised Code prevail in the event of a
conflict.
   (d)    Application of References. References to chapter or section numbers,
or to provisions not specifically identified by number, shall be construed to
refer to such chapter, section or provision of this code.
   (e)   Referenced Codes and Standards. The codes and standards referenced in
this code shall be considered part of the requirements of this code to the
prescribed extent of each such reference. Unless specified otherwise in this
code, reference in adopted sections to the term "International    Residential
Code" shall be changed to "residential code"; reference to "International Fire
Code" shall be changed to "fire prevention code"; and reference in design and
construction provisions to "one-and two-family dwellings" shall be changed to
"one-, two-, and three-family dwellings." Because the "International Code
Council" has placed design and construction information throughout its model
code documents, including into the fire prevention code, any referenced code
requirements relating to the design, construction, alteration, movement,
enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location,
removal, and demolition of every building or structure within the scope of this
code, shall be enforced by the residential building official. Where differences
occur between provisions of this code and referenced standards listed in
Chapter 43, the provisions of this code shall apply.
   (f)   Partial Invalidity. In the event any part or provision of this code is
held to be illegal or void, this shall not have the effect of making void or
illegal any of the other parts or provisions thereof, and it shall be presumed
that this code would have been adopted without such illegal or invalid parts or
provisions. (Ord. 30-10. Passed 6-22-10.)
1303.09  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   General. The residential building official in a municipality,
township, or county, whose residential building department has been certified
by the board of building standards, shall enforce provisions of the rules of

construction of residential buildings or parts thereof as defined in the rules
of the board in accordance with the certification. The building official shall
exercise exclusive responsibility for the enforcement of all design and

necessary notices or orders to ensure compliance with this code. When the
residential building official finds that work or equipment is contrary to
approved residential plans and the Rules of the board, the residential building
official shall send a notice in writing to the owner of said building or the
owner's agent. The notice shall state where and in what respect the work or
equipment does not conform to the approved plans for same and the Rules of the
board, and specify a reasonable period of time in which to conform to said
plans or the rules of the board.
   (d)    Inspections. If the plans for the erection, construction, repair,
alteration, relocating, or equipment of a residential building are subject to
inspection by the residential building official, under section 109, the

authorized to enter the residential structure or premises at reasonable times
to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this code, provided that
credentials are presented to the occupant and that entry is requested and
obtained. Where permission to enter has not been obtained, is denied, or the

hazard the residential building official shall have recourse to the remedies
provided by law to secure entry.
   (g)    Department Records. The residential building official shall keep

official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the
intent of the provisions of section 116.
      (1)   Tests. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with
the provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or method does not

1351.01 NUISANCE CONDITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, all dangerous buildings within the terms of this
section are hereby declared and shall be deemed to be public nuisances by
reason of the condition in which the same are permitted to be or remain and
which shall or may endanger the health, life, limb or property, or cause any
hurt, harm, inconvenience, discomfort, damage or injury to any person in the
City in any one or more of the following particulars:
   (a)    By reason of being a nuisance to the general health of the community.
   (b)    By reason of being a fire hazard.
   (c)    By reason of being unsafe in occupancy or use on, in, upon, about or
around the aforesaid premises.
   (d)    By reason of being a nuisance because of long continued vacancy and/
or lack of reasonable or adequate maintenance of the structure and/or premises
adjacent thereto, thereby depreciating the enjoyment and use of property in the
immediate vicinity to such extent that it is harmful to the community in which
such structure is situated.
   All dangerous buildings within the terms of this section are hereby declared
to be public nuisances, and shall be repaired, vacated or demolished as
hereinbefore and hereinafter provided. (Ord. 83-66. Passed 12-27-66.)
1351.02 STANDARDS FOR REPAIR, VACATION OR DEMOLITION.

no longer exist in violation of the terms of this chapter, it shall be
repaired.
    (b)    If the dangerous building is in such condition as to make it
dangerous to the health, morals, safety or general welfare of the occupants, it
shall be ordered to be vacated.
      (Ord. 83-66. Passed 12-27-66.)
   (c)    In any case where a dangerous building is damaged, deteriorated or
decayed to the extent of not more then fifty percent of its total building
replacement costs, which cost is to be determined by an independent appraisal
firm or bank appointed by the Building Inspector and President of Council and
which appraisal cost will be paid for by the applicant at the time the building
permit is applied for, it may be restored and extended in size but such
restoration extension shall not exceed more than a ten percent increase in the
cubical content of the original damaged building. In all cases where a building
cannot be repaired in accordance with the provisions of this chapter it shall
be demolished so that it will no longer exist in violation of the terms of this
chapter. In all cases where a dangerous building is a fire hazard existing or
erected in violation of the terms of this chapter or any ordinance of the City
or statute of the State, it shall be demolished.
(Ord. 17-71. Passed 3-9-71.)

The Building Inspector shall:
    (a)    Inspect or cause to be inspected all public buildings, schools,

reasonable.
   (f)    Place a notice on all dangerous buildings reading as follows: "This
building has been found to be a dangerous building by the Building Inspector.
This notice is to remain on this building until the building is repaired,
vacated or demolished in accordance with a notice which has been given the
owner, occupant, lessee, mortgagee or agent of this building, and all other

1351.04 BOARD OF APPEAL.
   (a)   There is hereby organized a Board of Appeal which shall be comprised
of the Safety Director, Service Director or Service Department Superintendent,
Fire Chief and two City residents who hold no elective office in the City of
Sheffield Lake, and who are appointed by the Mayor for a term of two years.
(Ord. 29-16. Passed 6-14-16.)
   (b)    Should a majority of the Board of Appeal, after the inspection of the
premises as provided for in Section
1351.06, on which it is recorded that a public nuisance exists, be of the
opinion that a public nuisance does exist, but that the nature thereof is not
such as to require the summary abatement of such nuisance, photographs and
reports of their findings, as provided for in Section
1351.06, shall be made and filed with the Building Inspector.
   It shall further be the duty of the Building Inspector to serve written
notice on the person, persons, firm or corporation having an interest in the
aforesaid property, to be issued as defined in Section
1351.03(d) and (e). The aforesaid notice shall state, in brief, the findings of
the Building Inspector, with respect to the existence of a dangerous building
or public nuisance as defined in Sections
1351.01 and
1351.02, and shall further state that unless the owner or owners thereof cause
the abatement of the dangerous building or public nuisance within sixty days
after the service of the notice, the same will be abated by the City at the
expense of such owner or parties in interest as provided for in subsection (d)
hereof. The owner or parties in interest may at any time after receipt of the
notice make a request in writing or in person to the Building Inspector, to be
furnished with a written list of the items which are alleged to constitute the
public nuisance and which are alleged to be in need of repair or replacement.
   The owner or parties in interest may make immediate application in writing
or in person to the Building Inspector for a building permit to undertake the
repair or replacement of items alleged to constitute the public nuisance. The
Building Inspector, upon being furnished by the owner or parties in interest
with the complete plans and specifications covering such repairs or
replacements, in conformity with the Codified Ordinances of the City, shall,
upon approval of the plans and specifications, cause a building permit to be
issued to the owner or parties in interest. The Building Inspector may grant
more than six days to the owner or parties in interest in which to effect the
repairs and/or replacements.
   The owner or parties in interest may, within fourteen days after receipt of
such notice, make a demand in writing to the Building Inspector for a hearing
on the question of whether in fact a public nuisance, as defined by Sections
1351.01 and
1351.02, exists and/or whether more than fifteen days should be granted to the
owner or parties in interest to abate the public nuisance. The hearing shall be
held within ten days following the receipt of the written note demand and at
least two days notice of the hearing shall be given to the owner or parties in
interest. The hearing shall be conducted by the Board of Appeal. A majority of
the Board of Appeal must find that a public nuisance exists, as defined by
Sections
1351.01 and
1351.02, before enforcement of the abatement is carried out. A majority of the
Board may amend or modify the notice and/or an order, or extend the time for
compliance by the owner of parties in interest with parts of the abatement by
such date or dates as such majority may determine.
   (c)    The Board of Appeal shall make written findings of fact from the
testimony offered as to whether or not the building in question is a dangerous
building within the terms of Sections
1351.01 and
1351.02.
   A copy of the decision of the hearing shall be promptly served upon the
owner or parties in interest in the manner provided for in Section
1351.03. The decision of the Board of Appeal shall be final and conclusive
unless the owner or parties in interest file, within fifteen days after the
aforesaid decision is rendered, an action in or appeal to a court of competent
jurisdiction; otherwise the same shall be final and conclusive at the
termination of such action or appeal proceedings as determined by the court.
   (d)    If the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessor or lessee fails to comply
with the order provided for in subsection (b) hereof, within fifteen days from
the day the first notice was issued by the Building Inspector under any
provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto,
the Board of Appeal shall cause such building or structure to be repaired,
vacated or demolished, as the facts may warrant, under the standard
hereinbefore provided in Section
1351.01 or Section
1351.02, and shall, with the assistance of the Director of Law, cause the cost
of such repair, vacation or demolition to be charged against the land on which
the building existed as a Municipal lien, or cause such costs to be added to
the tax duplicate as an assessment or to be levied as a special tax against the
land upon which the building stands or would stand or to be recovered in a suit
of law against the owner. In cases where such procedure is desirable and any
delay thereby caused will not be dangerous to the health, morals, safety or
general welfare of the people of the City, the Building Inspector shall notify
the Director of Law to take legal action to force the owner to make all
necessary repairs or demolish the building.

Section
1351.01 and
1351.02, shall be filed with the Building Inspector. Should a majority of the
Board of Appeal find that a public nuisance exists and that the nature thereof
is such as to require its summary abatement, it shall be the duty of the
Building Inspector to cause photographs of such nuisance to be made and to file
and keep in his file the written reports of the findings of the aforesaid
official.
   The Building Inspector shall determine the person, persons, firm or
corporation having an interest in the aforesaid property and shall immediately

1353.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of Sheffield Lake, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Sheffield Lake has special flood hazard areas that are subject
to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
(Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and

1353.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream and natural
protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. (Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Sheffield Lake as identified in Section
1353.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Sheffield Lake.
(Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.

a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations. (Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sheffield Lake, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part

   (s)   "Flood Protection Elevation" The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation in areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (t)   "Floodway" A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (u)   "Freeboard" A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (v)   "Historic structure" Any structure that is:

by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (x)   "Letter of Map Change" (LOMC) A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood
Insurance Studies.
   (y)   Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA): A line shown on a Flood
Insurance Rate Map to indicate the inland limit of the 1.5-ft breaking wave
height during the base flood.
   (z)   "Lowest floor" The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (aa)   "Manufactured home" A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (bb)   "Manufactured home park" As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home
park does not include any tract of land used solely for the storage for the
storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   (cc)   Mean Sea Level: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program,
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which
base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   (dd)   Moderate Wave Action Area (MoWA): A special flood hazard area subject
to the potential for breaking wave heights of greater than or equal to 1.5
feet, but less than 3 feet, where the primary source of flooding is storm
surges, seiches. A MoWA is an area within zone AE on a FIRM that is between the
inland limit of zone VE and a Limit of Moderate Wave Action, where identified.
   (ee)   "National Flood Insurance Program" (NFIP) The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (ff)   "New construction" Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Sheffield Lake
Flood Insurance Rate Map, March 1, 1978, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (gg)   "Person" Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and

includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (hh)   "Recreational vehicle" A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (ii)   "Registered Professional Architect" A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code §4703.01 and §4703.19
   (jj)   "Registered Professional Engineer" A person registered as a
professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 4733.
   (kk)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" A person registered as a
professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 4733.
   (ll)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99, V, or VE. Special flood hazard
areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other
federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical
flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas,
and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (mm)   "Start of construction" The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (nn)   "Structure" A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (oo)   "Substantial Damage" Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
      Substantial damage also means flood related damage sustained by a
structure on two (2) separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the
cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or
exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   (pp)   "Substantial Improvement" Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (qq)   "Variance" A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (rr)   "Violation" The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
 1353.36 et seq., Appeals and Variances.
   (d)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.

preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably be utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (b)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, and V1-30:
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         A.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         B.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM Data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
   1353.34(b) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
   
   (c)    Zones B, C, and X:
      (1)   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are not
required for areas designated as Zone B,C, or X on the effective FIRM which are

appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal
shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain
Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall
transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain
Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.39 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) set in the schedule of fees
adopted by the City of Sheffield Lake.
   (b)   Notice of Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for
a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1353.39(c)(1)-(11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.40 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (d)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (e)    All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (f)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.
   (g)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (h)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
(Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.41 APPEAL TO THE COURT.
   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal such
decision to the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter
2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.42 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations,
unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in
Section
1353.20.
   (b)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a violation
of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with Section
1353.99.
   (c)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1353.99.
(Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.43 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that there has been a
violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall give notice of such
violation to the person responsible therefore and order compliance with these
regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and order shall:
   (a)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form:

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
      (Ord. 9-21. Passed 2-9-21.)
1353.99 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense, and
shall constitute a second-degree misdemeanor. Any person who violates these
regulations or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the City
of Sheffield Lake. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Sheffield

      (2)    A description of the lot from which the building is to be moved,
if located in the City;
      (3)    A description of the lot, if located within the City, to which it

do this and thus necessitate additional inspections, the Building Inspector is
authorized to require an additional fifty dollars ($50.00) inspection fee for
each such additional inspection necessary.
      (2)    The application shall also be accompanied by a permit fee in the
amount of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00).
      (3)    The permit issued and fees charged pursuant to this chapter shall
not be considered as a permit or license to install or erect the structure
moved, and any person moving a building shall obtain all permits and pay all
applicable fees required by this Building Code for new construction to the same
extent as if he were erecting a new building.
      (4)    The applicant shall submit to the Division of Building Inspection
a copy of excess load and weight permits secured from the State.

period, if no such expenses or damages are claimed, or having been claimed,
have been satisfactorily adjusted by the applicant, such deposit will be
returned to the applicant. If claims of damages are still being made at the end
of such period, the City may, at its option:
   (a)    Apply so much of the deposit as may be necessary to satisfy such
claim and refund the balance;

result in the cancellation of permit required in Section

or windows, vehicular noises adjacent to the installation or other forces
unrelated to genuine alarms.
   (c)    All components comprising such a device must be maintained by the
owner or lessee in good repair to ensure reliability of operation.

operates, along with maintenance instructions.

with a copy of the instructions as to the way the device operates. If the Chief
finds such instructions to be incomplete, unclear or otherwise inadequate, he
or she may require the alarm equipment supplier to have the same revised to
meet his or her approval and then promptly have copies distributed to persons
for whom installations of such devices are made.
(Ord. 26-87. Passed 3-24-87.)

necessary to disconnect the alarm.
(Ord. 26-87. Passed 3-24-87.)

1395.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as and may be referred to and/or cited as the
Real Property Maintenance Code of the City of Sheffield Lake or the Real
Property Maintenance Code. References throughout this chapter to "this code"
shall mean the Real Property Maintenance Code. (Ord. 57-93. Passed 5-25-93.)
1395.02 POLICY.
   (a)    Council and the administration of the City are deeply concerned about
environmental problems developing within closely built-up urban areas. It is
the desire of Council, therefore, to provide for the residents of this City, a
clean, healthy, safe and protected environment in which to live. There have
been found to exist within the City premises the structures used for
residential and nonresidential use which are substandard, and that such
conditions as viewed exhibit: exterior structural deterioration; lack of
maintenance and appearance of premises and land areas; a disregard for proper
maintenance of business and industrial property areas in storage of equipment
and supplies; existence of fire hazards and unsightly, unsanitary conditions
which constitute a menace and threat to the health, safety, morals, public
welfare, comfort and well-being of the people of the City.
   (b)    It is hereby determined and declared by Council that because of the
lack of property maintenance of the exterior of structures and premises, and
permissive and progressive property deterioration, certain properties within
this City are creating blighting conditions, initiating slums and fostering an
unsanitary and unsightly environment.
   (c)    Council believes that unless these blighting, deteriorating,
unsanitary and unsightly conditions, factors and characteristics are curtailed,
removed and prevented from occurring in the future, they will lead to the
continuation, extension and aggravation of urban blight.
   (d)    A thoughtful study of this Real Property Maintenance Code should
serve to dispel impressions that it is repressive, punitive or aimed at total
conformity. It is, in reality, the City's first effort to set a City-wide tone
of orderliness and tidiness which are important elements in bringing about
quality development and growth.
(Ord. 57-93. Passed 5-25-93.)
1395.03 PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this Real Property Maintenance Code is to protect the public
health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance and conditions of all residential and nonresidential
premises; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators;
to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of residential and
nonresidential premises; and to fix penalties for the violations of this Code.
This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public
interest and it is intended that this Code be liberally construed to effectuate
the purposes as stated herein.

official of the City from enforcing any such other provision.
   (e)    Exceptions. Owners of vacant property or lots are excused from
compliance with any provision of this Code relating to landscaping, unless such

trailers used for sales or storage between the property line at the street
right of way and the front of every commercial or industrial building is
prohibited. All such boats, motor homes, recreational vehicles, travel trailers
and truck trailers used for sales or storage shall be stored in the rear yard
and screened from view. In the event that the commercial or industrial building
is located on a corner lot, boats, motor homes, recreational vehicles, travel
trailers and truck trailers used for sales or storage shall not be stored or
parked between the property line at the street right of way and the side of the
building facing the street.
   (c)    Structural Soundness and General Maintenance of Exterior; Residential
and Nonresidential. Every owner or operator shall maintain the exterior of
every structure or accessory structure free of nuisance. The exterior of every
structure or accessory structure shall not be kept by any owner or operator in
a condition unnecessarily offensive to the visual sensibilities of the average
person which would materially and economically detract from the district or
neighborhood.
   To effect the purpose of this section, the owner or operator shall use,
maintain or refrain from using the premises and all buildings thereon, as the
case may be as follows:
      (1)    Painting and other protective coating. All surfaces susceptible to
decay shall be kept at all times painted or otherwise provided with a
protective coating sufficient to prevent deterioration or rot.
      (2)    Surfaces. All surfaces shall be maintained free of broken windows,
crumbling stone or brick, peeling paint or any other condition reflective of
deterioration or inadequate maintenance.
      (3)    Exterior walls, sidings and roofs. Exterior walls, sidings and
roofs shall be kept structurally sound, in good repair and free from defects.
      (4)    Damaged materials. Damaged materials shall be repaired or
replaced.
      (5)    Rotted or corroded materials. Materials showing signs of rot,
deterioration or excessive corrosion shall be restored and protected.
   (d)    Reconstruction of Walls and Sidings.
      (1)    No owner or operator of any premises or buildings shall cause or
permit to be reconstructed walls and sidings on any buildings unless all
construction of walls and sidings is of standard quality permitted by this
Building Code and their appearance commensurate with the character of the
properties on the same block and on both sides of the street on which the
premises fronts.
      (2)    No owner or operator shall use any material of a kind that, by its
appearance under prevailing appraisal practices and standards, will depreciate
the value of neighboring and adjoining premises.
   (e)    Freedom from Infestation. No owner or operator of the premises or any
building thereon shall maintain the exterior parts of the premises or buildings
in a condition that will permit infestation by insects, rodents or other
vermin.
   (f)    Landscaping. Any landscaping provided for herein shall be installed
within sixty days of the issuance of any occupancy or re-occupancy permit. If
the Building Inspector determines that the weather does not allow for such
landscaping to be installed within that time period he may grant an extension
of time to so install provided a bond in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00) must be deposited by the person seeking the extension.
(Ord. 57-93. Passed 5-25-93.)
1395.08 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)    Director of Inspections to be Property Maintenance Officer. The
Building Inspector and/or assistant is hereby designated to serve as the
Property Maintenance Officer hereunder and all inspections, regulations,
enforcement and hearings on violations of the provisions of this Real Property
Maintenance Code, unless expressly stated to the contrary, shall be under his
direction and supervision. He may appoint or designate, subject to the approval
of the Mayor, such other public officials or employees of the City to perform
duties that are necessary to the enforcement of this Code, including the making
of inspections.
   
   (b)    Inspections; Residential and Nonresidential. All buildings and
premises subject to this Code are subject to inspections at all reasonable
times from time to time by the Property Maintenance Officer. At the time of
such inspections, all exterior parts of the premises must be available and
accessible for such inspections and the owner, operator and occupant are
required to provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such inspections.
Such inspections shall be made during regular open hours of the business
occupying the premises unless there is reason to believe a violation exists of
a character which is an immediate threat to health or safety requiring
inspection and abatement without delay.
   (c)    Conduct of Inspectors. Inspectors shall conduct themselves so as to
avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
 
   (d)    Refusal of Access. 
      (1)    Search warrant/access warrant. Where the Property Maintenance
Officer or his agent is refused access to the property or is otherwise impeded
or prevented by the owner, occupant or operator from conducting an inspection
of the premises, the Property Maintenance Officer may, upon affidavit, apply to
the Lorain Municipal Court for a search warrant setting forth factually the
actual conditions and circumstances that provide a reasonable basis for
believing that a nuisance or violation of this Code exists on the premises. If
the Court is satisfied as to the matter set forth in the affidavit, the Court
may authorize the issuance of a search warrant permitting access to and
inspection of that part of the premises on which the nuisance or violation
exists. A warrant for access may be issued by the Court upon affidavit of the
Property Maintenance Officer establishing grounds therefor.
      (2)    Penalties. If the Property Maintenance Officer is thereafter
refused access to the property or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the
owner, occupant or operator from conducting an inspection of the premises, such
owner, occupant or operator shall be in violation of this Code and subject to
the penalties provided in Section 
1395.99 . 
    (e)   Procedure Where Violation Discovered.
      (1)   Written notice. Where a violation of this Code, or the regulation
promulgated pursuant thereto is found to exist, a written notice from the
Property Maintenance Officer shall be sent via regular U.S. mail to the last
known address of the owner of the premises. Where it is ascertained that the
owner does not reside on the premises, the last known address shall be the
address of the owner as shown in the office of the County Auditor. If the last
known address cannot be ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside
front entrance of the building. The date of service of the notice shall be the
day of mailing.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, where premises are subject to
registration pursuant to Section
1361.02, and have been so registered, notice served upon the agent designate
therein shall constitute service upon the owner, operator and lessor of the
premises, jointly and severally. Where the owner, operator or lessor has failed
to register the premises as required by Section
1361.02, or if the present premises have been registered and the agent
designated therein cannot be found at the address given in the registration,
the owner, operator or lessor affected thereby may be served by posting notice
upon the premises in a conspicuous place as near to the front entrance thereon
as possible.
      (2)    Referral of violations. Any violation of any ordinance other than
this Code discovered by the Building Inspector or his representative shall be
reported to the official or agency responsible for the enforcement of such
ordinance.
      (3)   Should any violations of this Code remain uncorrected after ten
(10) days from the date of the mailing of notice provided for at subsection (e)
(1) herein, the violation(s) may be prosecuted by the filing of a complaint by
the Property Maintenance Officer in either the Sheffield Lake Mayor's Court, or
the Lorain Municipal Court, pursuant to Section
1395.99 of this Code.
         (Ord. 14-24. Passed 4-9-24.)
1395.09 EXISTING OFFENSES AND VIOLATIONS NOT DISCHARGED.
   The repeal of any provisions of any other ordinance by this chapter shall
not affect any action for prosecution or abatement under any such ordinance or
any notice, complaint or order issued by any office or agency of the City prior
to the effective date hereof or concerning any prosecution or other steps of
enforcement which have been taken or are being taken within any administrative
agency or in the Municipal Court for enforcement thereof.
(Ord. 57-93. Passed 5-25-93.)
1395.10 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BUILDING INSPECTOR AND BOARD OF ZONING AND
BUILDING APPEALS.
   (a)    Rules and Regulations. The Building Inspector is hereby authorized to
promulgate such written rules and regulations as may be necessary for the
proper interpretation and administration of the provisions of this chapter,
provided that such rules and regulations do not conflict with this chapter and
conform to the general standards prescribed by this chapter. The Building
Inspector shall file copies of such rules and regulations with the Clerk of
Council, the City Engineer, the Fire Chief and the Police Chief and shall make
available in the Building Inspector's office a copy for inspection by members
of the public during regular business hours.
   (b)    Variances. The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall have the
power to withhold or extend strict enforcement of the requirements of this Code
upon written application fee equal to cost therefor by an owner, operator or
occupant and after a public hearing provided that the Board determines that the
conditions specified in subparagraph (1) or (2) hereof exist.
      (1)    Any variation or modification of a structure or use approved by
the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall not in any material way alter
the standards of this Code and cannot affect detrimentally the health, safety
or welfare of occupants or owners or of adjacent premises or of the immediate
neighborhood and strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would
constitute an undue and unnecessary hardship on the owner or operator because
it would compel expenditures on the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit of health, safety or welfare that might be
derived therefrom.
      (2)    The premises subject to this Code are contemplated for acquisition
or are within an area where acquisition is contemplated by a public agency
having the power of eminent domain and there is a reasonable likelihood that
the premises will be acquired and razed or moved within a period of two years.
However, any waiver of the provisions of this Code shall be canceled and the
Building Inspector shall strictly enforce this Code if it is ascertained
subsequent to the granting of the waiver that the premises are in fact not to
be acquired for any public use or purpose.
      (3)    Notice of the time and place of the meeting of the Board, after an
application has been filed under the provisions of this section, shall be sent
to all property owners within a 500-foot radius of the property for which the
application is made. Notice shall be sent by the Building Inspector by regular
mail.
      (4)    Where variations or modifications are approved in any section of
this Code or by the action of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals or of
any court of record, a written record thereof stating the name of the
applicant, the address of the premises, the variation or modification approved,
the date of approval and the reasons therefor satisfying the provisions
contained herein, shall be prepared by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals
and filed both under the section or sections of this Code to which the
variation or modification applies and under the address of the premises. Such
files shall be available for public inspection in the office of the Building
Inspector during regular business hours.
      (5)    Any recommended amendment, addition or modification of the
provisions of this Code consonant with the field experience of the personnel
charged with enforcement;
      (6)    A summary of the time sequence enforcement experience indicating
the number of violations abated, the number of cases processed in the Municipal
Court, the number of inspections made and such other and further pertinent
information as will provide Council with a quarterly account of progress in
securing the standards required by this Code; and
      (7)    Any further recommendation as to how this Code and the procedure
and operations hereunder can be improved.
(Ord. 57-93. Passed 5-25-93.)
1395.11 INSPECTION AND STATUS REPORTS.
   (a)    Application for Inspection. Whenever an owner, operator, occupant,
bona fide prospective purchaser, mortgagee or bona fide prospective occupant
applies to the Building Inspector for an inspection in order to ascertain if
any section of this Real Property Maintenance Code has been violated, the
Building Inspector shall, upon payment of the fee provided in subsection (d)
hereof, cause an inspection to be made of the premises and issue an
informational certificate or report of the inspection to the applicant,
indicating therein any violations of this Code on the premises. The applicant
for such inspection shall state in writing his full name, his address and the
reasons and basis for which the inspection is requested. The Building Inspector
may deny the application for failure to comply with this requirement.
   (b)    Application for Status Report. When, in lieu of an inspection, an
owner, operator, occupant, lessee, bonafide prospective purchaser, mortgagee or
bona fide prospective occupant requests a status report as to whether or not
there are any known violations presently pending on the premises, a copy of any
notice or order on any violation then pending shall be sent to the applicant
upon payment of fees provided in subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)    Significance and Scope of Inspection or Status Report. No inspection
report issued under subsection (a) hereof or status report issued under
subsection (b) hereof shall be construed as providing a defense against any
violation of this Code or any other ordinance of the City which may be
discovered thereafter whether or not the condition or violation existed at the
time of any such inspection or status report. The inspection or status report
is provided as a convenience to the public and shall not constitute a
limitation on the full enforcement of this Code. The inspection or status
report shall include only such matters that are embraced in this Code.
   (d)    Inspection and Status Report Fees. 
      (1)    The minimum fee for any inspection made pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof shall be twenty dollars ($20.00). Dwellings of more than two dwelling
units or rooming units shall require an additional fee of two dollars ($2.00)
for each unit in excess of two.
      (2)    The fee for any status report or copy thereof issued pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof shall be four dollars ($4.00).
      (3)    Neither the City nor any of its agents shall be liable to any
owner or subsequent purchaser of real property for violations of this Code not
discovered at the time of inspection of the premises.
         (Ord. 57-93. Passed 5-25-93.)
1395.12 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word
contained in the Real Property Maintenance Code is declared invalid for any
reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
this Code which shall remain in full force and effect, and to this end the
provisions of this Code are hereby declared to be separable.

zoning requirements of this code and that the owner is current on the payment
of all real property taxes for the proposed rental dwelling unit or rooming

         (Ord. 18-18. Passed 5-8-18.)
1395.17 REFUSAL OF OWNER OR OCCUPANT TO CONSENT TO INSPECTION.
   Should an owner or occupant of residential rental property located in the
City refuse to consent to an administrative inspection of the property as

(Ord. 18-18. Passed 5-8-18.)
1395.18 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   Any permit granted or issued under the terms of this code to an owner or
operator may be suspended or revoked at any time by the Building Inspector upon
satisfactory proof of a violation of any provision of this code or which could
have been grounds for failure to issue an original permit, including
satisfactory proof that the owner of the rental dwelling unit or rooming unit
has allowed the real property taxes to become delinquent on the rental dwelling
unit or rooming unit. If a permit is suspended or revoked, said permit shall be
surrendered to the Building Department within five (5) days of notification of
such suspension or revocation.
