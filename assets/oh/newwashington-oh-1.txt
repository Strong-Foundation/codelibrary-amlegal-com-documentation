   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment
shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act
committed in the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an

provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and codification.

resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section contains new
material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance.
   Section 5.  Through authentication and approval of this Ordinance, the Mayor

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

181.02  LEVY OF INCOME TAX.
   To provide funds for the purpose of general municipal operations and other
municipal operations and other municipal purposes of the Village of New
Washington, Ohio, there be, and hereby is, levied a tax upon earnings at the
rate of one and one-half percent (1½%), commencing July 1, 2003, upon the
following:
   (a)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on
and after July 1, 2003, by resident individuals of the Village of New
Washington, Ohio.
   (b)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on
and after July 1, 2003, by non-resident individuals of the Village of New
Washington, Ohio for work done or services performed or rendered in the Village
of New Washington, Ohio.
   (c)   On the net profits attributed to New Washington, earned on and after
July 1, 2003, of all resident unincorporated businesses, professions and other
activities derived from work done or services rendered or performed and
business or other activities conducted in the Village of New Washington, Ohio.
   (d)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profit earned on
and after July 1, 2003, of a resident individual, partner or owner of a
resident unincorporated business entity attributable to New Washington and not
levied against such unincorporated business entity.
   (e)   On the net profits attributable to New Washington earned on and after

activities, conducted in the Village of New Washington, Ohio.
   (f)   On that portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned on
and after July 1, 2003, of a resident individual, partner, or owner of a non-
resident unincorporated business entity not attributable to New Washington and
not levied against such unincorporated business entity.
   (g)   On the net profits earned on and after July 1, 2003 of all

   (h)   Business Allocation Percentage Formula (Section 718.02, Ohio Revised
Code):
      (1)   In the taxation of income which is subject to municipal income
taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of a municipal corporation
shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is
attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the municipal corporation, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in such municipal corporation for purposes
of municipal income taxation. In the absence of such records, net profits from
a business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of a
municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such
municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average net book value
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereof by eight.
         B.   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the profession, wherever their
services are performed.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services wherever made or performed.
In the event the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an equitable
result, another basis may, under uniform regulation, be substituted so as to
produce such result.
      (2)   As used in subsection (1) hereof, “sales made in a municipal
corporation” mean:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation.
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal
corporation regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
   (i)   In the computation of any tax due under this chapter, a business loss
of a previous tax year shall not be allowed or carried forward to reduce the
tax due in any subsequent tax year.   
      (Ord. 844.  Passed 1-27-03.)
181.03  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Said tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to salaries,
wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and after July 1, 2003 and
with respect to the net profit of businesses, professions and other activities
earned on and after July 1, 2003. Provided, however, where the fiscal year of
the business, profession or other activity differs from the calendar year, the
tax shall be applied to that part of the net profit for the fiscal year as
shall be earned on and after July 1,  2003 to the close of the taxpayer's
fiscal year; thereafter the taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis. 
(Ord. 844.  Passed 1-27-03.)
181.04  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer whose earnings or profits are subject to the tax imposed
by this chapter shall, on or before April 15, 2005, and on or before April 15
of each year thereafter, make and file a final return with the Tax
Administrator on a form obtainable from the Tax Administrator or on a generic
form as defined in this chapter, setting forth the aggregate amount of salary,
wages, or other compensation and net profits earned by him or her during the
preceding year or period and subject to the tax, together with other pertinent
information as the Tax Administrator may require. Provided, however, that when
the final return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the
calendar year, the return shall be made within the 15th  day of the fourth
month following the end of the taxpayer's fiscal year.
   (b)   The return shall also show the amount of that tax imposed on such
earnings and profits. The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the
filing therefrom, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due
thereof. Provided however, that where any portion of such tax shall have been
paid by such taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.05  and/or Section
181.06, credit for the amount shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due
and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing
the final return.
   (c)    The return of an employee showing the amount of tax deducted by the
employer or employers from the salaries, wages or compensation of any employee,
and paid by him or them to the Tax Administrator, shall be accepted as the
return required of any such employee whose sole income subject to the tax of
one and one-half percent (1½%) is such salary, wages or compensation.
   (d)    Beginning January 1, 2005 any taxpayer that has requested an
extension for filing a Federal income tax return may request an extension for
the filing of an income tax return required in this chapter. The taxpayer shall
make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer's request for a Federal
filing extension with the office of the Tax Administrator. The request for
extension shall be filed not later than the last day for the filing of the
income tax return required by subsection (a) hereof. The Municipality shall
grant such a request for an extension for a period not less than the last day
of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal return
has been extended.  The Municipality may deny a taxpayer's request for an
extension only if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to file
a copy of the request for the Federal extension, owes the Municipality any
delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest,  assessment, or other charge
for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any
required income tax return, report, or other related documents for a prior tax
period. The granting of an extension for filing an income tax return does not
extend the last date for paying the income tax without penalty, unless the
Municipality grants an extension, in writing, to that date. In addition, if
unusual circumstances exist for the taxpayer, the Tax Administrator may extend
the time for filing of the annual return upon the request of the taxpayer for a
period not to exceed six (6) months, or three (3) months beyond any extension
granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal Income
Tax return. However, the Tax Administrator may require a tentative return,
accompanied by payment of the amount of the tax shown to be due thereon by the
date the request for extension is filed and the actual tax to be paid within
the period as extended. The taxpayer shall be responsible for interest and
penalty if the amount shown on the tentative return is less than the actual
amount determined to be payable in the final return.
   (e)   A tax in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) or less will not be
collected or refunded, provided that this subsection shall not be applicable to
taxes collected at the source under the provisions of Section
181.05, and provided further that nothing in this subsection shall dispense
with any requirement of this chapter relating to the filing of declarations,
returns and questionnaires.
   (f)    If a business has sustained a net operating loss in any taxable year,
such loss may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
   (g)    A taxpayer may aggregate rentals for a net rental income but no net
loss may be taken against other income nor may it be carried either forward or
backward.
   (h)   The residents of the Municipality are subject to taxation upon net
income from rentals on all properties located in the Municipality, and/or on
all properties located outside the Municipality, with credit being given for
income tax or taxes paid to other municipalities on rental profits on
properties in those other municipalities, but with said credit not to exceed
the total rate levied in this chapter. Non-residents of the Municipality are
subject to such taxation only if the real property is situated within the
Municipality and shall receive no credit for taxes paid to another
municipality.
   (i)   In no case may a taxpayer deduct business losses or rental losses
against wages or other compensation earned as an employee.
   (j)   In no case may a taxpayer deduct any work related expenses from W-
2 wages such as 2106 expenses that may have been deducted on the federal
return.
   (k)   Gambling winnings, lottery winnings and similar winnings and/or prizes
won by a taxpayer may be offset by gambling losses, lottery losses and similar
losses; however, no losses in any tax year may be carried forward or backward
to any other taxable year.
(Ord. 877.  Passed 11-22-04.)
181.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer who employs within the Village one or more persons on a
salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis, excluding exempted
incomes set forth in Section
181.15, shall deduct at the time of the payment of such salary, wage,
commission or other  compensation, the tax due from said employee and shall
make a return and pay to the Village Tax Administrator the amount of taxes so
deducted within ten (10) days after the time of the payment of such salary,
wage, commission, or other compensation provided an employer withholding such
prescribed tax which totals less than $25.00 in the aggregate during the pay
period may make his return and pay such aggregate withheld tax in accordance
with regulations adopted for the administration of this chapter.
   (b)   Said return shall be on a form prescribed by the Village of New
Washington and furnished by the Village Tax Administrator. Such employer, in
collecting said tax, shall be deemed to hold the same as trustee for the
benefit of the Village of New Washington until payment is made by such employer
to the Village of New Washington, and any such tax collected by such employer
from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village of New
Washington, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (c)   The officer or employee having control or supervision of or charged
with the responsibility of filing the report and making payment is personally
liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as required by this
chapter. The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or
pay tax due. 
(Ord. 844.  Passed 1-27-03.)
181.06  DECLARATION.
   (a)   Every taxpayer who anticipates any income which is not subject to the
provisions of Section
181.05 shall file a declaration of the estimated tax for the year of 2003. Such

similar declaration shall be filed for each calendar year, on or before April
15 of the ensuing year for the duration of the taxes referred to herein, by all
such taxpayers.
   (b)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form prescribed by the Village
Tax Administrator and furnished by the Village Tax Administrator, which fom1
may simply state the figures used in making such declaration are the figures
used in making the declaration of the estimates for the Federal Income Tax,
provided it is understood such figures may be modified according to the
provisions of this chapter so the declaration required by this Section shall
set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   The declaration to be filed on April 15 of each year shall be
accompanied by payments of at least one-fourth (1/4) of the estimated annual
tax, and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before June 15,
September 15 and December 31 of each year. Provided, however, such estimate may
be amended at the time of making any quarterly payment, and further provided on
or before April 15 of the year following that for which declaration was filed,
a final return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the Village of
New Washington shall be paid therewith. Should it appear such taxpayer has paid
more than the amount of tax to which the Village of New Washington would be
entitled a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be made, or the same may be
applied toward the declaration of tax due for the ensuing year. Claims for
refunds shall be made on forms prescribed by and obtainable from the Village
Tax Administrator.
(Ord.  844.  Passed 1-27-03.)

   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 972, effective
January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Ordinance Nos. 844 and 877 in

   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable

income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division  (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition

reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality  for all or part of the taxable year.
   (B)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:

consecutive days in the Municipality.  For purposes of this section, the
State's contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination

182.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
182.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
182.052 or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)     Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under Section
182.091.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
(Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
182.051.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051.

return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such

amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.

         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   “Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03(1).
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
182.03(11).
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081.
 
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a
portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)     When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the
owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-

         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.  (Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality.  If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through

182.091.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless
extended pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.10 upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period  of underpayment,

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

municipality. The credit shall not exceed three quarters of a percent (3/4%) on
such income earned in such other municipality where such tax is paid.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who receives

against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by him or in his
behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed three quarters
of a percent (3/4%) on such income earned in such other municipality here such
tax is paid.
   (C)   The owners of a pass through entity that are domiciled in the
Municipality shall be allowed a credit for taxes paid to another municipal
corporation by a pass through entity that does not conduct business in the

following amounts, but in no event to exceed three quarters of a percent (3/
4%):
      (1)   The amount, if any, of tax paid by the pass through entity to
another municipal corporation in this state, apportioned ratably according to
the ownership interest of all owners of the entity; or
      (2)   The amount of tax that would be imposed on the pass through entity
by the Municipality, if the pass through entity conducted business in the
Municipality, apportioned ratable according to the ownership interest of the
taxpayer in proportion to the ownership of all owners of the entity.
   (D)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Tax Administrator may be regulation provide.
   (E)   The credit against tax provided by this section is limited and

182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years  with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081.
(Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096. 
 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
 
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
182.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.

information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each

municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.   
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with

submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
182.092, the provision in Section
182.092 prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
182.051.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)     If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may  not  be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.  Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.

with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian

Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing

tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax

amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section

      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
182.096. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and /or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

182.10.

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the

accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action

liability of any other person.

claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation

   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement.  (Ord. 972.  Passed
11-23-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

include the person's social security number, federal employer identification

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Ordinance.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.15, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received

corporations.

relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.

conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

(Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described

collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. 
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)     A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax
Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought

182.096.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
182.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (D) of this
section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to
adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
182.19.
 
   (B)     Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
182.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 972.  Passed 11-23-15.)

ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11  PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a
false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. 
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

subsections.  (ORC 4511.99)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed

   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a registered nurse,
an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to

court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.

unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of

or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

have more than one valid license at any time.

accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that
required the holder of the probationary driver’s license to operate a motor

   (c)   (1)   If a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets.  “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the
immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization ordered
unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is

conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same

501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or

501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he

trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the
witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
         2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

herein, the New Washington Police Department or their authorized agent, shall
immediately cause the junk or junk motor vehicle to be removed from the
property where the junk or junk motor vehicle is located.  The place of storage

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,

constitute a hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease which
constitute a potential threat to other trees within the Village.  The Village
Tree Commission will notify in writing and by certified mail the owners of such
trees.  Should the certified letter be returned unclaimed, the Village shall
send a letter through regular mail to the owner’s last known address.  Removal
shall be done by said owners at their own expense within sixty days after the
date of service of notice.  In the event of failure of owners to comply with
such provisions, the Village shall have the authority to remove such trees and
charge the cost of removal on the owner’s property tax notice.
(Ord. 755. Passed 12-14-98.)
909.16  REMOVAL OF STUMPS.

   (a)   Connection With Sewer Required.  No person shall maintain or use or
permit to be used upon any lot or land abutting upon, or adjacent and
accessible to a public sanitary sewer any water closet, urinal or sink, laundry
or wash tub, showers, baths, or other gray water source not connected with such
sewer in such a manner as to properly discharge its contents into such sewer.
   (b)   Discharge of Untreated Wastes To Any Natural Outlet.  It shall be
unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the Village, or in any area
under the jurisdiction of the Village any sanitary sewage, industrial wastes,
or other polluted waters.
   (c)   Discharge of Wastes To Storm Sewers.  Wastes shall not be discharged
into a storm sewer unless the waste is of such character as would permit the
waste to be discharged directly into the body of water to which the storm sewer
discharges and be in compliance with all criteria and standards of discharge
established by the Village and other regulatory agencies, including the
provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3745.
   (d)   Grease and Oil Interceptors.  For grease, oil, and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of
the Village, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes,
containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in this section,
or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes of temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable
covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gas tight and water tight. All
interceptors shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. The owner shall provide and maintain all grease, oil
and sand interceptors, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at
all times. In the maintenance of these interceptors, the owner shall be
responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the
captured materials and shall maintain records of the data, and means of
disposal all of which are subject to review by the Village Board of Public
Affairs. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by
the owner's personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal
firms.
   (e)   Ground Garbage.  The disposal of unground garbage into the sewer
system is prohibited. Requirements for "properly ground garbage" are:
      (1)   That only food wastes be considered as garbage; and
      (2)   That all ground particles be of such size that they will be carried
freely under the normal flow conditions prevailing in the sewer conduit to
which they are contributory.
   (f)   Prohibition of Unpolluted Water.  No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged any unpolluted stormwater, surface water, ground water, roof
run-off, sub-surface drainage, cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process
waters to any sanitary sewer.
   (g)   Sewer Pipe Ventilation.  No sewer pipe for a water closet or any other
connection shall be allowed inside any house or building unless proper means
are provided for the ventilation of such pipe or sewer so as to effectively
prevent sewer gas from entering the building. It shall be the responsibility of
the building owner to provide this means.
   (h)   Storm and Surface Waters.  All surface runoff from areas expected to
yield good quality water such as roofs and foundation drains, paved areas,
lawns, and discharge from ground water collection systems must be excluded from
the sanitary sewers. Unpolluted water from air- condition systems, industrial
cooling operations, swimming pools, and so forth shall be discharged to the
storm sewers or directly to natural drainage outlets subject to the
requirements of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3745.
   (i)   Substances Limited.  The following described substances, materials,
waters, or wastes shall be limited in discharges to the Village system to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property,
or constitute a nuisance. The Village may set limitations lower than the
limitations established below if in its opinion more severe limitations are
necessary to meet the above objectives. Deliberate dilution with unpolluted
water to meet the concentrations established in the regulations below are not
acceptable. In forming its opinion as to the acceptability, the Village will
give consideration to such facts as the quantity of such waste in relation to
flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on
materials or characteristics of wastes or water discharged to the sanitary
sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the Village are as
follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150° F.
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than 50 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oils, products of mineral oil origin,
floatable oils, fat, wax and grease.
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded.
      (4)   Any waters or wastes containing solids, liquids, or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes to
injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the
receiving waters of the Wastewater Treatment Plant including, but not  limited,
to cyanides, hexavalent chromium, copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel and phenols in
the wastes as discharged to the public sewer. The following concentrations
shall not be exceeded in industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers:
Total cyanide (CN)  0.5 milligrams per filter (mg/1)
Hexavalent chromium 1.0 mg/l
Copper              1.0 mg/l
Zinc                1.0 mg/l
Cadmium             0.2 mg/l
Nickel              2.0 mg/l
Phenols             0.2 mg/l
Lead                0.5 mg/l
Mercury             0.01 mg/l
Silver              0.2 mg/l
Hydrogen Sulfide    10 mg/l
Sulfur dioxide gas  5 mg/l
These maximum concentrations may be changed as necessary by the Village or
State regulatory agencies based on new information concerning inhibitory
substances or to protect treatment plant processes. Industrial discharges
covered by Federal pretreatment requirements shall meet those limitations
specified under Section 304 (b) and 307 (b) of the Federal Act or the above
concentrations, whichever is more stringent. Major contributing industries
discharging incompatible pollutants into the public sewers shall be regulated
as provided by Section
925.05.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Village or any local or State regulatory
agencies.
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable State or
Federal regulations.
      (7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute "slug"
as defined herein.
      (8)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment process employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes
in the public sewer system release noxious gases, form suspended solids which
interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to
structures and treatment processes.
   (j)   Substances Prohibited.  No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any of the following described materials into any public sewers (or
treatment works):
      (1)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, cleaning solvents, paint
vehicles, or other flammable liquid, solid or gas.
      (2)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 9.0
or having any corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment, and personnel of the wastewater treatment works.
      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to,
ashes, bone, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass rags, feathers,
tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and
fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole
or ground by garbage grinders. Direct discharges of such materials as tar,
asphalt, paint, and waxes shall also be prohibited because they may adhere to
sewers and thus reduce the effective size of the pipe.
      (4)   Any garbage which has not been properly shredded.
      (5)   Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance capable of creating a
public nuisance.
   (k)   Toilet Facilities and Connections Required.
      (1)   The owner of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation or other purpose, situated within the Village
and abutting any street, alley, right-of-way, or sewer easement in which there
is now located or may be in the future located a public sanitary sewer of the
Village is hereby required at owner's expense to install suitable toilet
facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper
public sewer and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, within 365
days after the official notice but in no event later than January 1, 2001. The

bulk, height, design, and land coverage of buildings; by regulating and
limiting the density of population; and for the aforesaid purposes to establish
districts of such classification, number and dimensions as may be considered
best to implement comprehensive planning and to provide regulations and
procedures for the administration, interpretation, amendment and enforcement
thereof. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1101.03  OBJECTIVES.
   It is intended that the provisions of this Code shall be applied to achieve
the following objectives:

industrial and public uses and to assure their orderly and beneficial
development; and
   (b)   To provide adequate open spaces for light and air; to prevent
overcrowding of the land; to prevent excessive concentration of population; and

buildings and uses in relation to streets so as to cause the least interference
with and be damaged by traffic movements; and

restrictions upon buildings, structures, uses of land than imposed or required
by other codes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, or restrictive covenants
running with the land, this Code shall govern and conversely, other regulations
shall govern where they are more restrictive than this Code.
   (b)   This Code shall not be construed as removing or rendering inoperative
any deed or land restriction established by restrictive covenants running with
the land, easements, or other agreements between parties.

shall, unless otherwise fixed, be construed to coincide with the nearest
boundary line of the railroad right-of-way;
   (c)   Where a district boundary line divides a parcel of land, the location
of such boundary, unless related to fixed points on the property boundary,
shall be determined by scale, and the parts of the lot shall comply with the
regulations of the district in which each part is located;
   (d)   Where a district boundary line does not coincide with any of the
aforesaid lines, and where it is not located by dimensions or fixed points
shown on the map, it shall be determined by the scale appearing thereon; and

separated in ownership from that part of the lot upon which the building is
located, and no part of a required yard shall be considered as providing a yard
to any other existing main building.  A yard shall not be reduced to less than
the required dimensions for the district in which it is located and a yard of
less than the required width shall not be further reduced. Every required yard
shall be open and unobstructed from the ground upward except for accessory
buildings and permitted projections as regulated in this Code. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1113.14  FRONT YARDS OF PARTIALLY BUILT-UP BLOCKS.
   Where a building line has not been established by map or ordinance, and
where 50 percent or more of the aggregate street frontage between two
successive intersecting streets is occupied by buildings of the type and use
permitted in the district before the effective date of this Code, or a relevant
amendment thereto, the minimum front yard for new buildings shall be the
average setback distance of existing buildings located within 100 feet on
either side of a given lot, provided, however, the depth of the front yard
resulting therefrom shall be not less than one-half of the dimension specified
in the preceding schedule. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1113.15  SIDE YARDS; INSUFFICIENT WIDTH.
   Where side yards of a lot are less than required for the district in which
the building is located and if the lot was owned separately from all other
parcels of land on the effective date of this Code or a relevant amendment
thereto, and is still so owned, the building may be maintained, repaired,
modernized or altered but may not be enlarged in ground floor area unless the
enlarged portion complies with the regulations of this Code.

yard required for the adjoining lot which abuts said side street unless shown
otherwise on the Zone Map. The interior side yard of a corner lot, shall be not
less than the minimum width required for a side yard of any interior lot for
the district.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1113.17  YARD REGULATIONS FOR MULTIFAMILY DWELLINGS.
   In order to encourage greater flexibility in design and more attractive
arrangements of buildings and greater utilization of open spaces, yard
regulations for multifamily dwellings are hereby established for "single
development" and yard regulations for locating several buildings within a
"group development".
   The yards of multifamily buildings shall be related to the space within the
dwelling units as well as the yards. Buildings shall be arranged so as to
assure privacy between adjacent buildings and intersecting wings of buildings,
from streets, parking and recreation areas in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Definitions.  The terms in this section are defined as follows:
      (1)   "Single Development" means a development of one multifamily
building on one lot coordinated with the surrounding neighborhood and fronting
on a public street.
      (2)   "Group Development" means a development of more than one
multifamily building on a parcel planned as a unit and coordinated with the
surrounding neighborhood.
      (3)   "Main Wall" means any exterior wall of a multifamily building
containing the principal windows of a living, dining and/or sleeping room or
rooms.
      (4)   “End or Secondary Wall” means any exterior wall of a multifamily
building other than a main wall and containing secondary windows required for
ventilation and not intended to provide a direct view.
      (5)   "Overlapping Walls" means that portion of the exterior walls which
are directly opposing when two buildings, parallel or within 30 degrees of
being parallel, face each other across an open yard or court.
   (b)   Front Yard Depth or set back for multifamily buildings in single
development or group development, shall be not less than 30 feet measured from
the street line or as established otherwise on the Zone Map.
   (c)   Distance between facing and overlapping buildings, or parts thereof,
in a group development of multifamily buildings shall vary in direct relation
to the length and height of buildings. Such minimum distance shall be
determined by the formula:
 
Minimum Distance =  LA+LB+HA +HB
                F
The elements of the formula are shown on the attached illustrations and defined
as follows.
      (1)   "Minimum Distance" means the required minimum horizontal distance
between any wall of building "A" and the nearest wall of building "B" or the
vertical prolongation of either.
      (2)   “LA” means the total length of building "A" which, for the purposes
of the formula, is defined as the maximum length of the portion or portions of
any wall or walls of building "A" from which lines drawn perpendicular to the
face of such wall or walls will intersect any wall of building "B".
      (3)   "LB", means the total length of building "B" which, for the
purposes of the formula, is defined as the maximum length of the portion or
portions of any wall or walls of building "B" from which lines drawn
perpendicular to the face of such wall or walls will intersect any wall of
building "A".
      (4)   "HA", means the height of building "A".
      (5)   "HB", means the height of building "B".
      (6)   "F", means the divisor which is "4". Provided, however the minimum
distance between main walls of facing and overlapping buildings shall not be
less than 40 feet.
   (d)   Distance in angular arrangements of 30°to 60°, such minimum distances
are determined by the formula:
 
Minimum Distance =  2LB + HA + HB—k
                         F
The elements of the formula are as defined above and are shown on the attached
illustrations. The term "k" in the formula varies as the sin of 2n where n is
the angle from building "B" to building "A" or extensions thereof.
      Where n is:
      30° to 34°- K= 10'
      35° to 39°- K=20'
      40° to 50°- K = 25'
      51° to 55° - K=20'
      56° to 60° - K = 10'
   (e)   Distances between walls of court arrangements.  Such minimum distances
shall be determined by applying the formula set forth in subsection (c) above
to each set of facing walls. In arrangements of parallel walls with offset
sections, the distance between the corresponding parallel walls shall be
determined by said formula. The elements of the formula are shown on the
attached illustrations.
   (f)   Distance between nonoverlapping walls. Where walls of two buildings do
not directly face each other or do not overlap--that is where lines drawn
perpendicular from the face of any wall of any one building will not intersect
the face of any wall of another building--the minimum horizontal distance
between such buildings shall be not less than one-half of the combined height
of the two buildings. Such minimum distances shall be determined by the
formula:
 
Minimum Distance= HA+HB
             2
   (g)   Distance between building and boundary lines of a multifamily
building, or part thereof, in a single development or group development and any
side or rear lot line of the parcel or development area shall vary in direct
relation to the length and height of the building. Such minimum distance shall
be as determined by the formula:
 
Minimum Distance = 2 ( LL) + HA
            F
The elements of said formula are shown on the attached illustrations and
defined as follows:
      (1)   "Minimum Distance" means the minimum required horizontal distance
between any wall of a building and the nearest side or rear lot line, or
boundaries of the parcel or development area.
      (2)   "LL", means the maximum length of the side or rear lot which can be
intersected by lines drawn perpendicular from the face or faces of any wall or
walls of the building.
      (3)   "HA", means the height of the building "A".
      (4)   "F" means the divisor which is "4". Where any multifamily
development abuts a one or two-family residential district along any rear
property line, the minimum distance from any property line in such districts
and any main building shall be not less than two (2) times the height of the
main building.
   (h)   Use and design of yards.  The required yards, set forth above shall be
landscaped and may be used for pedestrian walks and passive recreation areas.
If, however, yards between buildings are used for parking areas, driveways, or
playgrounds, the distances between buildings shall be increased by the
dimensions of such intermediary facilities. The site shall be designed so that
entrances to all buildings shall be located not more than 200 feet from the
accessory parking area, the distance to be measured along pedestrian walks.
   (i)   Development plans for multifamily dwellings, shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for their review and recommendation and until found to
comply with said provisions and approved by the Planning Commission, building
permits shall not be issued.  The attached diagrams indicate the regulations
and planning criteria, which shall be used.
   (j)   Use and Design of Yards, as set forth above, may be used for
pedestrian walks, recreation areas, parking areas, or driveways; however,
accessory buildings or uses shall be located not less than set forth in the
following schedule. Yards not occupied by any of the above accessory buildings
and uses shall be fully developed with lawns, and other landscape features.
 
                    Minimum Distance from Main Minimum Distance from

conditions which may have been imposed in the approval of said Preliminary
Development Plan, that it is in accordance with the design criteria and
provisions of this Code which apply particularly to any plan of a SC District,
and that all applicable provisions of the Subdivision Regulations of the
Municipality have been complied with, the Planning Commission shall then

the zoning and the progress which has taken place and, if deemed necessary,
initiate proceedings to reclassify the property to an appropriate zoning
classification.
   (l)   Performance Bond.  A performance bond shall be required guaranteeing
the completion of all public improvements required by the Municipality before a
building permit may be issued. The scope of such improvements and the amount of
said bond shall be determined by the Municipality's Engineer.

1137.01  INTENT.
   Within districts established by this Code, buildings, lots and uses of
buildings and land which were lawful prior to the passage of this Code, but
which would be prohibited by the Code, are considered to be nonconforming
buildings, lots or uses.  It is the intent of this Code to permit such
nonconformities to continue until they are removed or abandoned, although they
are considered to be incompatible with the permitted buildings and uses in the
districts established by the Code. It is further the intent that nonconforming
buildings, lots and uses shall not be changed only to a more restrictive use,
and that the rebuilding of a nonconforming building destroyed in excess of 50
percent of its reproduction value shall be in conformance with all the
requirements of the particular district in which it is located. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1137.02  NONCONFORMING BUILDING.
   A building or other structure existing lawfully at the time this Code became
effective but which does not conform as to area or width of lot, yard
dimensions, lot coverage, height of building, intended use or other regulations
of the district in which it is located is a lawful nonconforming building. Such
building may be continued to be occupied so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Maintenance and Repair.  A nonconforming building may continue to be
used, maintained and repaired, provided, however, no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore to a safe condition, or make
the building or use conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Additions.  A nonconforming building shall not be altered, added to or
enlarged unless the additions and original building are made to conform to the
yard coverage and height regulations of the district in which it is located,
except a nonconforming dwelling may be altered, modernized or enlarged provided
the alteration and enlargements conform only to all yard regulations.
   (c)   Moving.  A nonconforming building shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other location on the lot or other premises unless every portion of
such building so moved is made to conform to all regulations of the district in
which it is to be located.
   (d)   Restoration of Damaged Building.  If a nonconforming building is
damaged or destroyed by any cause to the extent of 50 percent or less of its
reproduction value, those portions so destroyed or damaged may be restored but
to not more than its former size, provided such restoration is completed within
a period of one year from date of damage or destruction. If such a building is
occupied by a nonconforming use prior to damage such use may be continued. If a
nonconforming building is damaged or destroyed more than 50 percent of its
reproduction value, no repairing or reconstruction shall be made unless every
portion of the building is made to conform to regulations of the district in
which the building is located and unless occupied by a conforming use.
Determination of the reproduction value shall be made by three practicing
building construction contractors; one to be appointed by the owner, one to be
appointed by the Municipality and the third to be selected by mutual consent of
the two parties.
      (Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1137.03  NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS.
   A use of a building existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Code became
effective, but which does not conform to the use regulations, including the
sign, parking or loading regulations of the district in which it is located, is
a nonconforming use of a building and may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Change of Use.  The nonconforming use of a building may only be
changed to a conforming use, or to a use permitted in a more restricted
district if approved by the Commission. Thereafter it shall not be changed back
to the former nonconforming use. For this purpose the districts shall be
considered as listed in  order of restrictiveness, from most to least
restrictive, as set forth on the Zoning Map.
   (b)   Expansion of Use.  A nonconforming use of part of a building may only
be expanded or extended throughout those parts of a building which were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or
amendment of this Code but no such use shall be extended so as to occupy any
land outside such building.
   (c)   Discontinuance of Use.  If a nonconforming use within a building or
portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of two (2) years any
future use of such building, or portion thereof so discontinued, shall be in
conformity with the use regulations of the district in which the building is
located.
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs.  A sign, existing lawfully at the time this Code
became effective, but which does not conform with the sign regulations of the
district in which it is located, may be maintained and structural or electrical
parts may be repaired or restored to a safe condition only if required by law;
otherwise, a nonconforming sign shall not be altered or moved unless it is made
to conform with this Code, and if any sign, or part thereof is damaged or
destroyed to more than 50 percent of its reproduction value or taken down, it
shall not be rebuilt or relocated unless it shall be made to comply with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (e)   Nonconforming Parking Facilities.  A building, or use, existing
lawfully at the time this Code or an amendment thereto became effective, but
which does not conform with the off-street parking or off-street loading
regulations may be occupied by the existing use without such parking and/or
loading facilities being provided. If an existing building is altered so that
there is an increase of the number of dwelling units, seating capacity or floor
area, or if the use is changed to a use requiring more off-street facilities,
then off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided at least equal
to the number of spaces required for the entire building or use in accord with
this Code.
   (f)   Nonconforming as to Performance Standards.  A building or use existing
lawfully at the time this Code became effective but which is nonconforming as
to one or more of the performance standards shall not be required to conform
therewith except at such times that the building or use is changed or expanded.
      (Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1137.04  NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
   A vacant lot or parcel of land nonconforming as to use or dimension and
existing lawfully at the time this Code or an amendment thereto became
effective but which does not conform with the use and/or dimension regulations
of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming use of land, and such
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions.
   (a)   Expansion of Use. The nonconforming use of a lot, or part thereof,
shall not be expanded or extended onto other parts of the lot.
   (b)   Discontinuance of Use.  If the nonconforming use of a lot, or part
thereof, is discontinued for a continuous period of two (2) years, any future
use of such lot, or part thereof so discontinued shall be in conformity with
the use regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (c)   Insufficient Size.  A lot, or lots, nonconforming as to lot area and/
or lot width requirements of the district in which it is located, existing
lawfully at the time this Code or an amendment thereto became effective, may be
developed according to provisions included in this Code for lots of record of
insufficient area.
      (Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1137.05  NONCONFORMING USE DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION.
   The forgoing provisions shall also apply to buildings, structures, land or
other uses that thereafter became nonconforming as a result of reclassification
of districts, or of other amendments made to this Code, or of future
reclassification of districts or of other amendments made thereto.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1137.06  CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE.
   A nonconforming building or use shall cease to be considered as such
whenever it complies with the requirements of the district in which it is
located and shall not be resumed thereafter.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)

1141.01  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS; WHERE REQUIRED.
   Conditional Use Permits shall be required for certain types of main uses, so
classified, because of their uncommon or unique characteristics, infrequency of
occurrence, large area requirements or for other reasons.  Such use shall not
be permitted by right. The conditional uses enumerated in this Code may be
permitted under specific conditions in the district enumerated, and only if
such uses conform to standards provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1141.02  APPLICATION FOR PERMITS.
   An application for a Conditional Use Permit shall be made by the builder,
owner, or his agent to the Commission which shall hold a public hearing
thereon. Notice of such hearing shall be mailed to the owners of the property
in question and to those property owners deemed by the Commission to be
affected by the proposed use. Notices shall be mailed at least one (1) week
before the hearing. If an application is received at least five (5) days before
a scheduled meeting of the Commission, it shall take action within forty-five
(45) days after such meeting.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1141.03  STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING APPLICATIONS.
   An application for a Conditional Use Permit shall not be approved unless the
Commission finds that the proposed use complies with the following conditions
and standards.
   To be approved in a residential district, the Commission must find that:
   (a)   The proposed use will be properly located in relation to any adopted
land use plan and street plan and particularly in proper relationship to the
secondary and local streets and pedestrian circulation pattern, and
   (b)   The proposed use will generate only a minimum of traffic through a
residential neighborhood if located along a local street; and
   (c)   The proposed use is necessary to serve the surrounding residential
areas, which cannot be served satisfactorily if the same use is located in a
nearby, less restrictive district where it may be permitted by right; and
   (d)   The location, design and operation of such use would not discourage or
interfere with the appropriate development or impair the value of the
surrounding residential district. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1141.04  APPROVAL.
   The Commission shall make a determination based on the information available
or it may request additional information. If the application for the
conditional use is approved the Commission shall set forth any specific terms,
conditions and safeguards that shall be required so that the proposed use will
conform with the intent and standards of the district. The Commission shall
then instruct the Building Inspector to issue a Conditional Use Permit. The
Council shall be notified of such action. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1141.05  REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   A Conditional Use Permit shall become null and void if construction of the
proposed project has not begun within six (6) months after approval by the
Commission. The Commission may revoke a Conditional Use Permit on the
recommendation of the Building Inspector upon determining that the use does not
comply with the terms and conditions of such permit.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
CHAPTER 1145
Similar Uses
1145.01   Determination of similar uses.
1145.02   Commission action.
 
1145.01  DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   The Planning Commission may clarify or add to the list of permitted
buildings and uses in any of the districts on its own initiative, or upon
application for a permit for a building or use not specifically listed in any
classification. In so doing the Commission shall comply with the following
standards:
   (a)   Such use is not listed in any other classification of permitted
buildings or uses; and
   (b)   Such a use is more appropriate to, and conforms more closely to the
basic characteristics of the classification to which it is to be added than to
any other classification, and
   (c)   Such a use does not create dangers to health and safety, and does not
create offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare or other
objectionable influences to an extent greater than the other uses listed in the
classification to which it is to be added; and
   (d)   Such a use does not generate traffic to a greater extent than the
other uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added.  (Ord.
474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1145.02  COMMISSION ACTION.
   The Commission may recommend such additions or clarifications to the
Council. If the Council by a majority vote of its members concurs with the
recommendation of the Commission such use shall be deemed to be listed in the
appropriate section of that use group, and shall be added thereto in a
published supplement to this Code with a notation indicating that the addition
was made in accord with the provisions of this chapter.

1149.01  INTENT.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear any questions or disputes involving
the interpretation of provisions of this Code and grant variances from the
strict letter of said Code in instances of unnecessary hardship;  but shall not
alter provisions of the Zoning Code or change the district boundaries of the
Zoning Map, which are the function of the Council.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.02  JURISDICTION.
   The Board shall adopt such rules and regulations, as may be necessary to
carry into effect the powers and jurisdiction conferred upon it as follows:
   (a)   To hear appeals on decisions made by the Building Inspector, or by any
administrative officer on matters relating to this Code for relief from any
order, requirement, decision or determination, including the refusal, granting
or revocation of permits, and may thence decide appeals by reversing, or
affirming wholly or in part, or modifying said order, requirement, decision or
determination;
   (b)   To hear and decide upon applications for variations from the terms
provided in this Code subject to the standards provided in this chapter;
   (c)   To hear and decide all matters specifically referred to it for
decision, such as determination of district boundary lines, as provided in this
Code.
      (Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.03  APPLICATION FOR APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   An appeal shall be entertained by the Board only if formal action has been
taken by the Building Inspector or other officials with regard to an
application for a building permit, zoning certificate, issuance of a stop
order, specific referral, or some similar action, provided:
   (a)   Within thirty (30) days of such action, application for appeal from a
decision shall be filed with the Building Inspector; and where applicable, an
application for a variance shall be filed with the Building Inspector, and
   (b)   Application for appeal or variance shall include reference to the
decision or section of this Code from which the appeal or variance is sought
and all necessary data in accordance with the form provided.
      (Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.04  MEETINGS AND HEARINGS.
   If an application for appeal or variance is received at least five (5) days
before a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, it shall hold a hearing
within forty-five (45) days from such meeting date. A decision shall be
rendered within forty-five (45) days from the date of the hearings unless an
extension of time is mutually agreed upon. Failure to render a decision within
such period shall be considered approval. Notices of the time and place of
hearings shall be mailed by first class mail, by the Clerk to the appellant, to
all abutting property owners, and if determined by the Board, to other property
owners affected by the case as they appear in the current records of the County
at least one (1) week prior to the hearing and/or be published for two (2)
successive weeks prior thereto in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Municipality. All hearings conducted by the Board shall be open to the public.
Any person may appear and testify at a hearing either in person or by duly
authorized agent or attorney. The Board shall have the power to administer
oaths, to produce reports, findings and other evidence pertinent to any issue
referred to the Board for a decision. The Board shall entertain a rehearing on
a case if new evidence is submitted, however, once a case has been decided,
such rehearing shall not be held for a period of at least six (6) mouths from
the date of the previous decision.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.05  QUORUM AND VOTE.
   A quorum of the Board shall consist of three (3) members and the concurring
vote of at least four (4) members shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of any duly authorized administrative
officer.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.06  RECORD OF DECISIONS.
   The Board shall provide a detailed report of all its proceedings, setting
forth it reasons for decisions, the vote of each member participating therein
and the absence of a member or his failure to vote. Immediately following the
Board's decision, such record including conditions prescribed by the Board
shall be filed and posted for two (2) weeks in the office of the Building
Inspector, and copies shall be mailed forthwith to each interested party noted
therein. Any permit issued in pursuance of any decision of the Board shall have
incorporated therein any special conditions prescribed by it. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.07  REASONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   The Board shall have the power, in specific cases, to vary the application
of certain provisions of this Code in order that the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, and general welfare may be safeguarded and substantial
justice done for the following reasons:
   (a)   Where unnecessary hardships would result from the literal application
of the provisions of this Code.  Hardships which are unavoidable if the purpose
and intent of this Code are to be realized, such as theoretical loss or limited
possibilities of economic advantage, are not unnecessary hardships. Likewise, a
hardship based on conditions created by the owner is not an unnecessary
hardship. It must be found that there are peculiar and special hardships as
applicable to the property involved which are separate and distinct from the
general hardship in the district; and
   (b)   Where exceptional circumstances or conditions, only applicable to the
property involved or to the intended use of the property, do not apply to other
property within the same district. The mere fact that the owner of one parcel
might apply prior to the owner of other parcels in the same area would not give
him a right to a variance and thus grant a special privilege to an individual
when said variance would be necessarily denied to others. It must be found, on
the other hand, that there are exceptional conditions justifying a variance on
one lot, such as topographical or geological features or type of adjoining
developments, and that a variance would be justified on any lot where the same
exceptional circumstances prevail; and
   (c)   Where granting of a variance will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the neighborhood
in which the property is located. The mere existence of an unnecessary hardship
or other exceptional circumstances is not ipso facto evidence for granting of a
variance, for such hardships must be balanced against the present conditions
and extent such a variance would interfere with the proper future development
and rights of adjacent property; and
   (d)   That the granting of a variance will not be contrary to the general
purpose, intent and objectives of this Zoning Code or other adopted plans. A
variance merely permits that which is contemplated in this Code for unnecessary
hardships and exceptional circumstances. On the other hand, that which was not
contemplated in this Code, although deemed desirable, should be effected by
amendments.
      (Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.08  LAPSE OF VARIANCE.
   An appeal of variance once granted shall not be withdrawn or changed unless
there is a change of circumstances, or if after the expiration of six (6)
months, no substantial construction is done is accordance with the terms and
conditions for which such appeal or variance was
granted.  The Building Inspector shall give a notice in writing and thirty (30)
days thereafter the  appeal or variance shall be deemed null and void, and all
regulations governing said premises in
question shall revert to those in effect before the variance was granted.
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1149.09  APPEALS TO COUNCIL.
   A person aggrieved by a decision of the Board in regard to an appeal or a
request for a variance as set forth in this Code may within thirty (30) days
after such decision, appeal to the Municipality Council. After reviewing the
Board's decision, the Council may reverse the decision by a majority vote of
its membership.

1157.01  INTENT.
   This Code may be amended periodically in order to be current with new zoning
techniques and changes in enabling legislation governing municipal planning and
zoning. The Code may also be amended when a general hardship prevails in a
given area or where new development affecting the use of land is being
planned. 
(Ord. 474.  Passed 8-27-73.)
1157.02  INITIATION OF AMENDMENT.

1157.04  ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   (a)   Upon receiving the recommendation of the Commission on a proposed
amendment the Council shall advertise for and hold a public hearing. For all
proposed text or map amendments at least one (1) notice shall be given in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality at least thirty (30) days

also be mailed by the Clerk, by first class mail, at least twenty (20) days
before the hearing date, to owners of property within and contiguous to, and
directly across the street from, the parcel or parcel subject to the proposed
amendment. The addresses of such owners shall be obtained from the addresses
appearing on the County Auditor's tax list or the County Treasurer's mailing
list. The failure to mail notices to owners whose names do not appear on such
lists, as well as the failure of delivery of such notice, shall not invalidate
any such amendment. The published and mailed notifications shall set forth the
time and place of the public hearing and a summary of the proposed amendment.
   (b)   During the thirty (30) days preceding the hearing, a copy of the text
of such amendment, and/or the map showing the area proposed to be changed and
reports submitted by the Commission shall be on file for public inspection in
the office of the Clerk. After the public hearing the Council may adopt the
proposal as recommended by the Commission by majority vote of those elected to

buildings along all streets running northerly and southerly, and Kibler Street,
shall constitute the base line for numbering buildings along all streets
running easterly and westerly.
      (1)   Each building north of Mansfield Street, and facing a street
running in a northerly direction shall carry a number and address indicating
its location north of said base street.
      (2)   Each building south of Mansfield Street and facing a street running
in a southerly direction shall carry a number and address indicating its
location south of said base street.

the base street shall bear even numbers.  All buildings on the south and west
side of each street running from the base street shall bear odd numbers.
   (e)   Where any building has more than one entrance serving separate
occupants, a separate number shall be assigned to each entrance serving a
separate occupant providing said building occupies a lot, parcel or tract
having a frontage equal to 20 feet for each such entrance.  If the building is
not located on a lot, parcel or tract which would permit the assignment of one
number to each such entrance, numerals and half numerals shall be used, as set
forth in subsection  (h) herein.
   (f)   All buildings facing streets not extending through to the base line
shall be assigned the same relative numbers as if the said street had extended

completed within six months from the date of the adoption of this chapter and
thereafter there shall be assigned to each house and other residential or
commercial building located on any street, avenue or public way in said
Village, its respective number under the uniform system provided for in this
chapter according to said survey.  When the said survey shall have been
completed and each house or building has been assigned its respective number or
numbers, the owner, occupant or agent shall place or cause to be placed upon
each house or building controlled by him the number or numbers assigned under
the uniform system as provided in this chapter.
      (2)   Such number or numbers shall be placed on existing buildings on or
before the effective date of this chapter, and within twenty days after the
assigning of the proper number in the case of numbers assigned after the
effective date of this chapter.  The cost of the numbers shall be paid for by
the property owner.  Replacement of numbers shall be procured and paid for by
the owner.  The numbers used shall be not less than three inches in height and
shall be made of a durable and clearly visible material.  If the proper number
is not placed on an existing building on or before the effective date of this
chapter, it shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Streets to install the
proper number or numbers on said premises as hereinafter set forth, and to make
a charge of five dollars ($5.00) for each number so installed; which said
charge shall become a lien against the premises on which said building is
located, and shall be added to the Village real estate tax on said premises for
the ensuing year.
      (3)   The numbers shall be conspicuously placed immediately above, on or
at the side of the proper door of each building so that the number can be seen
plainly from the street line.
   (h)   Where only one number can be assigned to any house or building, the
owner, occupant or agent of such house or building, who shall desire
distinctive numbers for the upper and lower portion of any house or building,
or for any part of any such house or building fronting on any street, such
owner, occupant or agent shall use one-half numbers for upper floors, as may be
required.
   (i)   For the purpose of facilitating a correct numbering, a plat of
streets, avenues and public ways within the Village showing the proper numbers
of all houses or other buildings fronting upon all streets, avenues or public
ways shall be kept on file in the office of the Village Superintendent of
Streets.  These plats shall be open to inspection of all persons during the
office hours of the Superintendent.
   (j)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Streets to inform any
party applying therefor of the number or numbers belonging to or embraced
within the limits of any said lot or property as provided in this chapter.  In
case of conflict as to the proper number to be assigned to any building, the
said Superintendent shall determine the number of such building.
   (k)   Whenever any house, building or structure shall be erected or located
in the Village of New Washington after the establishment of a uniform system of
houses and building numbering has been completed, in order to preserve the
continuity and uniformity of numbers of the houses, buildings and structures,
it shall be the duty of the owner to procure the correct number or numbers as
designated from the Superintendent of Streets for the said property and to
immediately fasten the said number or numbers so assigned upon said building as
provided by this chapter.  No building permit shall be issued for any house,
building or structure until the owner has procured from the Superintendent of
Streets the official number of the premises.  Final approval of any structure
erected, repaired, altered or modified after the effective date of this chapter
shall be withheld by the Village Building Inspector until permanent and proper
numbers have been affixed to said structure.

within the State shall pay a claim to a named insured for fire damage to a
structure located within the Village where the amount recoverable for the fire
loss to the structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000)
unless there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company
equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate limits of liability on
all fire policies covering the building or structure, the insurance company in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall transfer from the insurance proceeds
to the Village Clerk in the aggregate one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), and each fraction of that amount, of a
claim; or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured and the insurance company, the named insured has submitted a
contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate.  Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro
rata basis by all companies insuring the building or other structure.  Policy
proceeds remaining after the transfer to the Village shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms.  The named insured may submit a contractor’s
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure after the transfer, and the designated officer shall return the
amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured, provided the
Village has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other
structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the proceeds by the Village as authorized by this
section, the Village Clerk shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be
used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing the building or structure incurred by the Village pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 715.261.
      (1)   When transferring the funds as required in subsection (a) hereof,
an insurance company shall provide the Village with the name and address of the

procedures will be followed.
      (2)   The fund shall be returned to the named insured when repairs or
removal or securing of the building or other structure has been completed and
the required proof received by the designated officer, if the Village has not
incurred any costs for such repairs, removal or securing.  If the Village
incurs any costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain,
the Village shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured.  Nothing
in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of a municipal
corporation to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
municipal corporation and the named insured from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other

the duties of this section.  The Clerk shall file a certified copy of this
section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State.
