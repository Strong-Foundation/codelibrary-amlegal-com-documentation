CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in
Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross
references and any future legislation.

place of residence shall be required before any Council action on any proposed

Passed 6-6-23.)
   (b)   Special Meetings. Special meetings may be called by a vote of Council
taken at a regular or special meeting thereof, or shall be called by the Clerk-
Treasurer upon request from the Mayor or any three members of Council. Any such
request shall state the time, place, date, and subject matter to be considered
at the meeting. Notice of each such meeting shall be given to each member of
Council by delivery to his or her residence or (by request of the Council
member) to his or her mail slot at the Village Hall not less than twenty-four
hours before a meeting is scheduled. In addition, the Mayor, the Clerk-
Treasurer and the Solicitor shall be similarly served with a notice, but a
failure to send them shall not invalidate an action taken at such meeting. Any
member of Council may expressly waive notice. Residents may request to receive
notification of special meetings through the Village Swift Reach System.
Procedures for establishing notification request forms, as well as Swift Reach
notification shall be administered by the Clerk-Treasurer. Whenever a member of
Council who has not properly been served with a notice is present at such
special meeting, the giving of notice shall be deemed waived by such member.
Legislative action at a special meeting shall be limited to the subject matter
for which the special meeting was called.
   (c)   Workshops. Workshops shall be scheduled as prescribed by Council and
shall be deemed and treated as a special Council meeting with subject matter
that requires an informal atmosphere. Thus, the meeting need not be held in
Council Chambers. The caucus room is sufficient unless there are other
attendees too numerous to accommodate. Notice rules shall be the same as those
for special meeting as set forth in subsection (b) of this section.

classes established in subsection (b) hereof. No person subject to this "pick
up" shall have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required

up" by the Village of Valley View or of being excluded from the "pick up". The
Village of Valley View shall, in reporting and making remittance to the Public
Employees Retirement System of Ohio and the Police and Firemen's Disability and
Pension Fund, report that the public employees' contribution for each person

contribution by that employee, and shall be paid by the Village to PERS and the
Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund on behalf of that employee as

pick-up provisions of this section shall not be greater than the amounts it
would have paid for those items had this provision not been in effect.

provisions of this section to effect the "pick up" of the statutorily required

TITLE TEN - Judicial
         
Chap. 290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Pursuant to the authority of Ohio R.C. 1905.01, the Village of
Valley View has established a Mayor's Court. This section provides that such
Court has
".....jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of
an ordinance of the municipal corporation, and has jurisdiction in all criminal
causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on state highways located
within the boundaries of the municipal corporation, subject to the limitations
of sections 2937.08 and
2938.04 of the Revised Code."
However, the statutory jurisdiction of most Ohio Mayor's Courts was
circumscribed by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Ward v. Village
of Monroeville, 409 US 57, 61 Ohio Op. 2d 292 (1972), reversing Village of
Monroeville v. Ward, 27 Ohio St. 2d 179 (1971), which held that where a mayor
has wide executive powers with respect to the operation of the municipal
government, he cannot be regarded as an impartial judge in a contested Mayor's
Court proceeding and that the holding of such a trial would deny a defendant
constitutional due process of law.
   Based upon the Ward case and the legal powers, duties and responsibilities
of the Mayor of the Village of Valley View, it would appear that while the
Mayor can accept a free and voluntary plea of "guilty" or "no contest" or a
forfeiture of collateral, he must, where a defendant enters a plea of "not
guilty, " order the removal of the case to the Garfield Heights Municipal Court
for further proceedings. See also Rule 9 - Jury Demand, of the Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases for All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas, effective January 1, 1975, as amended.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the

contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04 SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131; Ord. 74-12-10. Passed 12-27-74.)
414.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in divisions (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D., and
(d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not
more than $150.
         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, R.C. §
4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court shall
impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $250.
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $500. The court
also may impose a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege for 90 days.
         D.   Notwithstanding divisions (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)    If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted
driving safety course, as described in R.C. § 4511.991. If the offender attends
and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender's driver's license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of
offenders to whom division (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., or (d)(1)D. of this section
applies.
      (3)   The court may impose any other penalty authorized under R.C. §§
2929.21 to 2929.28. However, the court shall not impose a fine or a suspension
not otherwise specified in division (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.
      (4)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, points shall
be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section
unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or physically
supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic wireless
communications device.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of division (a) of this section shall inform the operator that
the operator may decline a search of the operator’s electronic wireless
communications device. The officer shall not do any of the following:
         A.   Access the device without a warrant, unless the operator
voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Electronic wireless communications device.”
         A.   Includes any of the following:
            1.   A wireless telephone;
            2.   A text-messaging device;

432.43 USE OF ELECTRONIC WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICES BY MINORS OR
PROBATIONARY DRIVERS WHILE DRIVING PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver's license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Division (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:
      (1)   A person using an electronic wireless communications device for
emergency purposes, including an emergency contact with a law enforcement
agency, hospital or health care provider, fire department, or other similar

this section shall be fined $300. In addition, the court shall impose a class
seven suspension of the person’s driver’s license or permit for a definite
period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a
violation of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct, the two offenses are allied
offenses of similar import under R.C. § 2941.25.

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician- intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)(1)
(J) or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (m) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)    The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (m) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

(1)I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle

sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (G)(1)(b)(v).
         C.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) that was a felony, regardless of
when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio

      (4)   If an offender's driver's or occupational driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(5).
      (6)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal

independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any
other penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to Section

of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for which the
offender is sentenced under division (h) of this section.
      (8)   A court may order an offender to reimburse a law enforcement agency

concentration of a controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in the offender’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine at the

any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C.
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, the court shall suspend
any jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under
that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction imposed
for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(4). The court may grant limited driving

      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to § 698.02
(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.

Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.
   (k)   If a person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that division, if both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a

termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

delinquent child for a violation of this section shall not be admissible as
evidence in any civil action that involves the offender or delinquent child who
is the subject of the conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from
the wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.

been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The

applicable. The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered
under this section unless the court is presented with current proof of
financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.

         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially

(ORC 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.

or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7).

within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

of this section to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets Federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose

to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a

admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

person included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not
required to have the affidavit obtained in accordance with division (c)(3) of
this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton, or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a process for a person to be included in the

officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of the municipality
except those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the
vehicle or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit shall be in the form that the
Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe a permit fee to be
imposed and collected when any permit described in this section is issued. The
permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse the Municipality for the
administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit, and also to cover the cost
of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway
structure as the result of the operation of the nonconforming vehicle or
combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the

portable, sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
vehicles on highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed
location, having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the
combined load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a
highway vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded
or unloaded.

the state.
   (e)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (f)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the

of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or

452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Police Chief, upon notification to the Police Chief of such action
and of the location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor
vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the Police Chief's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when
such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered
into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

time, the Police Chief shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Police Chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the Police Chief issues an order under division (a) of this section
and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing
service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the
Police Chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the Police Chief within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner's and any lienholder's
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief's records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing
of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.

or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the
municipal corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service
shall give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately

fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.

zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by

zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.

with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due
care, he or she fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may
exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.
   (c)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (d)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability." Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication." Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   "Involuntary acts." Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession." A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.

sheriff pursuant to R.C. § 2923.125 in order to obtain or renew a concealed
handgun license or is made in an affidavit submitted to a county sheriff to

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. §

   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.

actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for

degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a

of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if

of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to

offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to

State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.

R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section
618.18 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and

620.01 SUMMARY.
   The work specified in this section includes drill-and-blast methods,
vibration and airbast limits, blast design, blasting safety, instrumentation
and monitoring as they relate to construction and demolition activities. Mining
operations shall be governed by applicable sections of the Ohio Revised Code as
administered by ODNR as well as applicable sections of the Federal regulations.
(Ord. 2005-5-4. Passed 5-3-05.)
620.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context indicates or clearly requires a different meaning.
   (a)   "Acceleration" means a measure of the force exerted by the vibrating
earth particle measured in g's. The acceleration of gravity (g-32.2 ft/sec 2).
   (b)   "Air overpressure" (airblast) is the increase in ambient air pressure
resulting from detonation of explosives. It includes high-frequency waves
responsible for audible noise and inaudible low-frequency waves which may
induce vibration in structures.
   (c)   "Blast area" is the area in which there is any potential for flying
material, air overpressure, or blasting gases to cause injury to persons.
   (d)   "Components of motion" means ground motion, measured in three mutually
perpendicular components, namely:
      (1)   Longitudinal or radial motion;
      (2)   Transverse motion;
      (3)   Vertical motion.
   (e)   "Contractor" means the person, firm or corporation when engaged in any
construction operations involving the use of explosives for blasting purposes
under prime contract with owner.
   (f)   "Controlled blasting" is a method of controlling blast elements
including hole size depth, spacing, burden, charge size, charge distribution,
and delay sequence to excavate rock to a smooth surface with minimal overbreak.
   (g)   "Coupling" is the degree to which an explosive fills the cross section
of a borehole. A 6-inch explosive in a 6-inch borehole is completely coupled. A
2-inch explosive (surrounded by air) in a 6-inch borehole is "air de-coupled".
   (h)   "Cushion blasting" is a form of controlled blasting whereby small-
diameter columns of explosives or a series of cartridges taped to detonating
cord are cushioned by backfilling the annulus of the borehole with sand or
dirt. Cushion blasting is generally used to slash narrow benches of rock toward
an open rock face.
   (i)   "Delay" is a distinct pause of pre-determined time between detonation
or initiation impulses, to permit the firing of explosive charges separately.
   (j)   "Displacement" means the amount of ground motion measured in fractions
of an inch.
   (k)   "Energy ratio" means a measure of the kinetic energy of the vibrating
earth particle. It is defined as follows:
      Energy Ratio — (a/f)2   a-acceleration in ft. per second2 (note not in
g's)
      f-frequency of vibration tabulated in cycles per second
   (l)   "Explosive" means any chemical compound or mechanical mixture that is
intended for the purpose of producing an explosion, that contains any oxidizing
and combustible units
   (m)   "Frequency" means the number of oscillations of the ground or earth
particle that occur in one second, tabulated in cycles per second, c.p.s.
   (n)   "Fumes" are the gaseous products of an explosion. For the purpose of
fume classification only gases such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide and
nitrogen oxides are considered.
   (o)   "Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME) Fume Classification" is a
classification indicating the amount of gases produced by an explosive or
blasting agent.
   (p)   "Line drilling" is a method of controlled blasting in which holes are
spaced about 2 to 4 times the hole diameter around the perimeter of the
excavation; the holes are generally left unloaded, or may be loaded with light
charges of detonating cord, to provide a plane of weakness.
   (q)   "Longitudinal" or "radial" means motion along a line joining the shot
point and point of observation.
   (r)   "Maximum charge weight per delay" is the maximum total weight of
explosive detonated within any timed delay period of minimum 8-millisecond
duration.
   (s)   "Peak particle velocity (ppv)" is the maximum of three single-
component blast induced ground motions measured in the vertical, longitudinal,
and transverse directions.
   (t)   "Presplitting" is a blasting technique in which perimeter charges are
detonated first in the firing sequence, or as a separate blast ahead of
production blasting.
   (u)   "Scaled distance" is defined as the distance from a blast measured in
feet, divided by the square or cube root of the maximum charge weight per delay
measured in pounds. Square root scaling shall be used for ground vibration
calculations required herein. Cube root scaling shall be used for air
overpressure calculations.
   (v)   "Smoothwall blasting" is a method of controlled blasting in which
holes are spaced 18 to 24 inches apart around the perimeter of the excavation;
the holes are loaded with low linear charge density, and fired after the main
production holes have been blasted.
   (w)   "Transverse" means motion at right angles to the line joining shot
point and point of observation.
   (x)   "Velocity" means the rate at which the ground or earth particle
vibrates measured in inches per second.
   (y)   "Vertical" means motion up and down.

purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of

materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the

report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved

the accused person, or the accused's attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

building, structure or premises within the Village, as may be necessary to
enforce the provisions of this chapter, provided permission is obtained from
the occupant or, in the case of unoccupied property, from the owner or his or
her agent. If such permission is refused, or is otherwise unobtainable, a
search warrant must be obtained upon the showing of probably cause that a
violation of this chapter may exist, before such entry or inspection is made.
(Ord. 96-10-3. Passed 12-3-96.)
634.06 SPECIAL VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Mayor or his or her designated representative shall have the
authority, consistent with this section, to grant special variances.
   (b)   Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this section shall
file an application with the Mayor or his or her designated representative. The
application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the
source of sound or activity for which the special variance is sought into
compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the
applicant, on the community or on other persons. Notice of an application for a
special variance shall be given by the Mayor or his or her designated
representative to persons who frequent the area of the sound or activity and
who may be adversely affected by the granting of the variance. Any individual
who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may
file a statement with the Mayor or his or her designated representative,
containing any information to support his claim.
   (c)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Mayor or
his or her designated representative shall balance the hardship to the
applicant, the community and other persons, of not granting the special
variance, against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of
persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other
adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special
variances, and persons contesting special variances, may be required to submit
any information the Mayor or his or her designated representative may
reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the City Manager or
his or her representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and
the reasons for denying or granting the special variance.
   (d)   Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted
activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions
are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any conditions of a special
variance shall terminate it a subject the person holding it to those provisions
of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for which the
special variance was granted.
   (e)   Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variances, or for modification of other substantial conditions, shall be
treated like applications for initial special variances.
   (f)   The Mayor or his or her designated representative may issue guidelines
approved by Council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a

determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.

substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same

property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

642.25 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.23:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

660.19 STORAGE OF JUNK VEHICLES.
   (a)   (1)   For purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any
motor vehicle which is three years old or older; extensively damaged, such
damage including but not limited to any of the following: missing wheels,
tires, motor, or transmission; apparently inoperable; and having a fair market
value of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) or less, that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than 72 hours with the
permission of the person having the right to possession of the property, except
if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility
licensed under the authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise
regulated under authority of a political subdivision; or if the property on
which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by
any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the
possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a
bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector's
vehicle.
      (2)   The Municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector's vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
Municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The Police Chief, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor of a first offense. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this
section, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
two or more violations of this section, whoever violates this section is guilty

698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;

more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.

   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the

division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.

any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the

travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for

municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.   
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)    Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand

($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another State, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.

698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
( Editor's note: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

nor shall any license be issued hereunder, until and unless the applicant for a
license hereunder deposits with the Mayor a policy or certificate of liability
insurance for each taxicab for which a license is sought, acceptable to and
approved by the Mayor and the Solicitor, indemnifying the applicant in the sum
of at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for injury to any
person, five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for injury to more than one
person and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) property damage in any one accident
which occurs through the operation of the taxicab of the applicant. The policy
shall further contain a clause obligating the surety company to give ten days
written notice to the Mayor before cancellation of the policy, and the license
shall expire upon the lapse or termination of the policy of insurance. Such
policy of insurance shall contain a provision for a continuing liability
thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any recovery thereon. If
at any time, in the judgment of the Mayor, such policy is not sufficient for
any cause, the Mayor may require the owner of such taxicab to replace such
policy with another approved by the Mayor and Solicitor.

the owner a card of such size and form as may be prescribed by the Mayor. The
card shall contain the official license number of the taxicab, together with
the date of inspection of the same and a statement to the effect that, in case
of any complaints, the Mayor shall be notified and given the license number of
the taxicab. Such card shall be signed by the Mayor and shall contain blank
spaces upon which an entry shall be made of the date of every inspection of the
vehicle by the inspector. The license card shall be of a distinctly different
color each year and, in the case of taxicabs driven by mechanical power, the
license number assigned hereunder shall in each case be the same as that
assigned to the vehicle for that year, pursuant to law. There shall also be
printed upon such card the license number of such vehicle, which shall be
conspicuously displayed within the taxicab as prescribed by the Mayor.

880.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   The income tax levied by the Village of Valley View at a rate of 2% is
levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or
earning and/or receiving income in the Village of Valley View.
   (a)   Individuals.
      (1)   For residents of the Village of Valley View, the income tax levied
herein shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and
other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident,
including the resident’s distributive share of the net profit of pass-through
entities owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
880.02(c)(16)).
      (2)   For non-residents all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident’s distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (3)   For residents and non-residents, income can be reduced to
“Municipal Taxable Income” as defined in Section
880.02(c)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
880.02(c)(12).
   (b)   Refundable Credit for Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
      (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   “Qualifying loss” means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   1.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village of Valley
View with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
            2.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the “qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the Village of
Valley View each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         D.   “Refundable credit” means the amount of the Village of Valley
View income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   If, in addition to the Village of Valley View, a taxpayer has paid
tax to other municipal corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation’s proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village of Valley View for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (c)   Domicile.
      (1)   A.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Village of
Valley View for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled
in the Village of Valley View on the last day of the immediately preceding
taxable year or if the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the
individual is domiciled in the Village of Valley View for all or part of the
taxable year.
         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (c)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Village of Valley View for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the Village of Valley View for all or part of a taxable year, factors that
maybe considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   The individual’s domicile in other taxable years;
         B.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         C.   The address on the individual’s driver’s license;
         D.   The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual’s
residence or domicile;
         E.   The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
         F.   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual’s residency;
         G.   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
         H.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual’s dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual’s spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the Village
of Valley View. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one
“contact period” with the Village of Valley View if the individual is away
overnight from the individual’s abode located outside of the Village of Valley
View and while away overnight from that abode spends at least some portion,
however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in the Village of Valley View.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
   (d)   Businesses. This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a
business or profession in the Village of Valley View, unless the taxpayer is an
individual who resides in the Village of Valley View or the taxpayer is an
electric company, combined company, or telephone company that is subject to and
required to file reports under R.C. Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (d)(2) and (e) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village of Valley View shall be considered as
having a taxable situs in the Village of Valley View for purposes of municipal
income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village of Valley View during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated. As used in this paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village of Valley View to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual’s services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
880.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village of
Valley View to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (d)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the Village of Valley View, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Village of Valley View may require, that the taxpayer use,
with respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an
alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
880.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (d)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
880.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (d)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in (d)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor, customer,
client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (d)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (d)(1)C. of this section, and except
as provided in division (e) of this section receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village of
Valley View from a stock of goods located within the Village of Valley View.
            2.   The property is delivered within the Village of Valley View
from a location outside the Village of Valley View, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within the Village of Valley View and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village of Valley View to the extent that such services are performed in the
Village of Valley View.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village of Valley View shall be sitused to the
Village of Valley View.
         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village of Valley View shall be
sitused to the Village of Valley View.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village of Valley View based upon the extent
to which the tangible personal property is used in the Village of Valley View.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village of Valley View’s tax
only if the property generating the net profit is located in the Village of
Valley View or if the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a
resident of the Village of Valley View. The Village of Valley View shall allow
such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village of Valley
View, if applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or
broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village of Valley View to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Village of Valley View
shall report the individual’s net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual’s annual tax return for the Village of Valley View. The individual
may claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Village of Valley View’s income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (d)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (d)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipt s of such disregarded entity.
      (8)   Intentionally left blank.
      (9)   Intentionally left blank.
   (e)   (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
880.04(a)(2)A., on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services at that location.
         D.   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (e)(1)D.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (e)(1)D.1. or 2. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (d) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
            A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
            The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
            After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies
to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
            Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (d)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (e)(2) of this section:
         A.   For the purpose of division (d)(1)A. of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible. For the purpose of division (d)(l)A. of this
section, the average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a
qualifying remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work
location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (d)(1)B. of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (d)(1)C. of this section, and
notwithstanding division (d)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (d)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
880.02 or
880.03.
(Ord. 2018-4-2. Passed 4-3-18; Ord. 2023-11-4. Passed 11-7-23.)
880.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding Provisions.
      (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Village of Valley View shall withhold an income tax from
the qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village of
Valley View. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
880.03 or division (a)(2)D., F. or H. of this section, the tax shall be
withheld at the rate specified in Section
880.01(b)(1) of this chapter, of 2%. An employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date
that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village of Valley View the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
            1.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village of Valley View in the preceding calendar year exceeded
two thousand three hundred ninety nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total
amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld
on behalf of the Village of Valley View in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (a)
(2)A.1. of this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than
fifteen days after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Valley View. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer’s, agent’s, or other payer’s obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
         C.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Village of Valley
View as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income
subject to the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the
employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
         D.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village of Valley View income tax with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation’s successor entity.
         E.   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village of Valley View the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
         F.   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village of Valley View income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         G.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Valley View until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         H.   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
            1.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village of Valley View during the preceding calendar year;
            2.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
            3.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
            4.   Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
            5.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
         I.   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         J.   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Valley View income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s
employee s and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
         K.   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
   (b)   Occasional Entrant -Withholding.

or controlled by an employer.
         C.   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, “principal place of work” means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee’s
employer.
            1.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (b)(2)B. of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted

of that date.

the filing of the Village of Valley View’s income tax return.

of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass- through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of

payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For

request any documentation that substantiates the requestor’s claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any

shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.

requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section

refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
880.18(a)(4).

   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,

under this division within the period prescribed by Section

that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village of Valley View. A request filed under

the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return, unless it

880.09.

   (d)   (1)   Not withstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

assessment is collected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board

appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the

provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer’s rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business

alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (1)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer’s attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.

who is not an attorney.

(Ord. 2018-4-2. Passed 4-3-18.)
880.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)   “Last known address” means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   “Undeliverable address” means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the assessment’s
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Valley View
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (c) (l)A. of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
               “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date.”
         A.   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery
of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         B.   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the per son’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Valley View official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator’s designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2018-4-2. Passed 4-3-18.)
880.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Valley View that arises pursuant to the Village of Valley
View’s income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2018-4-2. Passed 4-3-18.)
880.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,

levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or
earning and/or receiving income in the Village of Valley View.
   (a)   Individuals.
      (1)   For residents of the Village of Valley View, the income tax levied
herein shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and
other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident,
including the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through
entities owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income in Section
882.02(c)(16).
      (2)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (3)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to “Municipal
Taxable Income” as defined in Section
882.02(c)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

            2.   “Qualifying loss” means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the

property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   a.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village of

Valley View each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.

View income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a

income tax paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village of Valley View for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
         D.   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (c)   Domicile.
      (1)   A.   1.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Village

Village of Valley View. For the purposes of this division, an individual has
one “contact period” with the Village of Valley View if the individual is away

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (d)(1)B. of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

in the Village of Valley View during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
                  As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
            2.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the Village of Valley View to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the

division (d)(1)A.3.;
            3.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Village of Valley View to total gross receipts of the business or profession
during the same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or
performed.
         B.   1.   If the apportionment factors described in division (d)(1)A.
of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:

               b.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
               c.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
               d.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
            2.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
882.12(a).
            3.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (d)(1)B.1. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
882.12(a).
            4.   Nothing in division (d)(1)B. of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
            3.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (d)(1)C.1. or 2. of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

to which the tangible personal property is used in the Village of Valley View.
         E.   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village of Valley View's tax

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other

employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         J.   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Valley View income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
         K.   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

            3.   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an

basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a

fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
                  If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)B.1.a. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
                  For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with

            7.   “Worksite location” means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this State at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. “Worksite location” does not
include the home of an employee.

section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village of Valley View
income tax on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services in the Village of Valley View if the employee performed such
services in the Village of Valley View on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year,
unless one of the following conditions applies:
               a.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village of Valley View.
               b.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village of Valley View. For the purposes of this

temporary worksite in the Village of Valley View at which the employer provides
or provided services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by
the employer to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can
“reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than 20 days” if either of
the following applies at the time the services commence:
                  i.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
                  ii.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
               c.   The employee is a resident of the Village of Valley View
and has requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying
wages as provided in Section
882.04.
               d.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
            2.   For the purposes of division (b)(1)B.1. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village of Valley View only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in the Village of Valley View than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
               a.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
               b.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

(c)(1)B.2.c. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
               5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
         C.   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (b)(1)B.1. of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
         D.   1.   Except as provided in division (b)(1)D.2. of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village of Valley View exceeds the 20-day threshold,
the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Valley View for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village of Valley
View.
            2.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
of Valley View under division (b)(1)D.1. of this section may elect to withhold
tax for the Village of Valley View for the first 20 days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Village of Valley View.
         E.   If an employer's fixed location is the Village of Valley View and
the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
882.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village of Valley View, regardless of the number of days which the employee
worked outside the corporate boundaries of the Village of Valley View. To
determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year,
the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
         F.   Divisions (b)(1)B.1. and (b)(1)D. of this section shall not apply
to the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
882.04.

         A.   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information reported on the
taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1041, Form

taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
         D.   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village of Valley View to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (a)(6) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files
on a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (7)   A.   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

View's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village of Valley View's
income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to
file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
            1.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village of Valley View's income tax return.
            2.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Village of Valley View income tax return. If the request
is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village of
Valley View income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
         C.   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Village of Valley View's
income tax return. The extended due date of the Village of Valley View's income
tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax
return.
         D.   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Village of Valley View, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
         E.   To the extent that any provision in this division (a) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of
this section, the provisions in divisions (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) prevail.

View shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits of
the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         B.   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village of Valley
View for a taxable year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall
file with the Village of Valley View an annual net profit return under division
(a)(7)C. of this section.
      (9)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
882.04(a)(1)A.1. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
      (10)   Taxes withheld for the Village of Valley View by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
882.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village of Valley View, unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the Village of Valley View and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the Village of Valley View to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return prepared who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of
any income tax return, report, or document required by the Village of Valley
View, provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of
the information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
adopted by the Village of Valley View or the Tax Administrator, and provided
that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise
complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the Village of Valley
View's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of
returns, reports, or documents.
   (b)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the Village of
Valley View's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   (c)   Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
of Valley View for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Village of Valley View
during the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days
thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred
eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant
shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred
eighty-first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         C.   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under this
division (c)(2)C. are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

this division the application of divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
         B.   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (c)(3)B.1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(c)(3)B.1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(3)B.1. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this

Internal Revenue Code.

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
Federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (d)
(1)A. of this section.
         D.   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 4927.01.
         E.   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 5727.01.
      (2)   A.   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village of
Valley View's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under Federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (d)
(2)B. of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
         B.   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (d)(2)A. of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         C.   An election made under division (d)(2)A. and B. of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village of Valley View income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village of Valley View. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Village of Valley View income tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated Village of Valley View income tax return
for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group of corporations” for “a C corporation's”
wherever “a C corporation's” appears in that division.
         B.   No corporation filing a consolidated Village of Valley View
income tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
882.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Village of Valley View income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
882.05(d)(1) through (8), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the Village of Valley View. lf the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

882.05(d)(1) through (8), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the Village of Valley View. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

882.05(d)(1) through (8), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass- through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net
profit sitused to the Village of Valley View;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Valley View income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village of Valley View income
tax return shall make the computations required under Section
882.05(d)(1) through (8) by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village of Valley View
income tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest,
penalties, fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village of Valley
View in accordance with this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of
which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or
anyone or more members of such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village of Valley View before January 1, 2016, to
file a consolidated or combined tax return with the Village of Valley View may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village of Valley View who
is required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax
to another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the

same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents
who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, “the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (d)   Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
882.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Village of Valley View's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   “Tax liability” means the total taxes due to the Village of Valley
View for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is
entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or
credit from another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the Village of Valley View from qualifying
wages shall be considered as paid to the Village of Valley View in equal
amounts on each payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, “date of
the postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
882.02(a)(7) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of
Valley View, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
882.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the Village of Valley
View under Section
882.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of Valley
View but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar
year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
882.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($0.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
882.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as in
Section
882.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00) or more.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
882.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
882.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
§ 882.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Valley View,
but should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Valley View as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation
on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Valley View is subject to recovery by
the Village of Valley View. If the Village of Valley View tax on that income is
imposed after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding
paid to the other municipality, the Village of Valley View shall allow a non-
refundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village of Valley View
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If the Village of Valley View's tax rate is less than the tax rate in
the other municipality, then the non-refundable credit shall be calculated
using the Village of Valley View' s tax rate. However, if the Village of Valley
View' s tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the
tax due in excess of the non-refundable credit is to be paid to the Village of
Valley View, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period
of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
882.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the Village of Valley View changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer' s Federal or State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Valley View. The amended return shall be
filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
882.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
882.12(e) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village of Valley View. A request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations
only to those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
882.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or State
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Valley View's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Valley View return
showing income subject to the Village of Valley View income tax based upon such
final determination of Federal or State tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay
any additional Village of Valley View income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars ($10.00).

882.12 LIMITATIONS.

            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
882.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
882.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Valley View does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
882.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
882.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the Village of Valley View income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
882.13 AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
882.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Last known address” means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means, such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   “Undeliverable address” means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Valley View
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date.”
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)(1)A. of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Valley View official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-9-9. Passed 10-6-15.)
882.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Valley View that arises pursuant to the Village of Valley
View's income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim

authorized by law;

may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal

inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep

not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village of Valley View or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this section shall fail

requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

   (a)   Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies or organizations, of societies or organizations for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or of societies or organizations
conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving
substantial support from voluntary contributions, of improving any municipal
corporation or of maintaining a cooperative or community center place, if no
part of the net earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or
individual;
   (b)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
organizations or posts, associations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State and if no part of their net
earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual;
   (c)   Exclusively to the benefit of members of the Police or Fire
Departments of any municipal corporation or the dependents or heirs of such
members; or
   (d)   Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission. This
exemption from the tax, however, shall not be allowed in cases wherein the
admission price is forty-one cents (41¢) or more.
   The exemptions from the tax provided by this section shall not, however, be
allowed in cases of admissions to wrestling matches, prize fights or boxing,
sparring or other pugilistic matches or exhibitions, nor in the case of
admissions to any athletic game or exhibition the proceeds of which inure
wholly or partly to the benefit of any high school, academy, preparatory or
other school, wherein the admission price is forty-one cents (41¢) or more, or
the proceeds of which inure wholly or partly to the benefit of any college or
university.
   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from admissions tax has
been allowed, the treasurer of the institution, society or organization for
whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Village Treasurer setting forth the amount of money actually received by such
treasurer, together with the expense of promoting and conducting such event.
Such statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption
from admissions tax for the benefit of such institution, society or
organization, and if such statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for
the promoting and conducting of such event in relation to the profits, if any,
no such exemption shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
   The exemptions from the tax provided by this section shall not be allowed to
any institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis if such percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.
(Ord. 50-6-1. Passed 6-6-50.)
884.04 PRICE TO BE MARKED ON TICKET.
   The price (exclusive of any Federal tax to be paid by the person paying for
admission) at which every admission ticket or card is sold shall be
conspicuously and indelibly printed, stamped or written on the face or back of
that part of the ticket which is to be taken back by the management of the
theater, opera or other place of amusement, together with the name of the
vendor, if sold other than at a ticket office of the place of amusement.
(Ord. 50-6-1. Passed 6-6-50.)
884.05 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (a)   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Village Treasurer as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected the same fails to remit the same to the Village Treasurer in
the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of
his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, is
nevertheless personally liable to the Village for the amount of such tax. No
person shall fail to make the remittance as herein required.
   (b)   The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Village Treasurer
in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the twentieth day
of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made
by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Village
Treasurer, but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax
from liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Village Treasurer
unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The person
receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms
and setting forth such information as the Village Treasurer may require. Such
forms shall show the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable
for the preceding monthly period. Such person shall sign and transmit the same
to the Village Treasurer with a remittance for such amount. However, the
Village Treasurer may, at his discretion, require verified annual returns from
any person receiving admission payments setting forth such additional
information as he deems necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax
collected and payable.
   (c)   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or
amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Village
Treasurer shall be the judge, the Treasurer may require the report and
remittance of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at
the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, at the conclusion of the
series of performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the Treasurer
determines. No person shall fail to comply with any requirement of the Village
Treasurer as to report and remittance of the tax.
   (d)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein
levied shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable
times subject to examination and audit by the Village Treasurer. If the tax
imposed by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added, as part of
the tax, interest at the rate of one percent per month from the time the tax
becomes due until paid.
(Ord. 50-6-1. Passed 6-6-50.)
884.06 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Village Treasurer,
make application to and procure from the Treasurer a Certificate of
Registration, the fee for which shall be one dollar ($1.00). Such Certificate
shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued.
Such Certificate or duplicate original copies thereof to be issued by the
Village Treasurer without additional charge, shall be posted in a conspicuous
place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold.
(Ord. 50-6-1. Passed 6-6-50.)
884.07 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION IN CASE OF TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY
AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a Certificate of Registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or places where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax
imposed by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
884.05 by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a Certificate of Registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Village
Treasurer of the issuance of such Certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 50-6-1. Passed 6-6-50.)
884.08 TAXES A LIEN.
   The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be a lien upon all of the property
of any person required to collect and pay or to pay the same. If he sells out
or quits his business, such person shall be required to make out the return
provided for under this chapter within thirty days after the date of sale of
such business or retirement therefrom, and his successor in business shall be
required to withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the
amount of such taxes so collected and unpaid, together with interest, if any,
until such time as the former owner produces a receipt from the Village
Treasurer showing that the taxes have been paid or a certificate that no taxes
are due. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold purchase money as
above provided and the taxes so collected are due and unpaid after the thirty-
day period allowed, he shall be liable for the payment of the taxes collected
and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by the former owner,
together with interest, as provided by this chapter.
   The lien for unpaid taxes herein imposed shall not become effective until
such time as the Village Treasurer certifies to the Auditor of Cuyahoga County
the amount of taxes delinquent and such certification is placed on record by
the Recorder of Cuyahoga County in a book maintained for that purpose.
(Ord. 50-6-1. Passed 6-6-50.)
884.09 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Village Treasurer is hereby authorized to adopt rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter for carrying out and
enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A
copy of such rules and regulations shall be published in the Village Record at
least once before they become effective and copies shall be printed and made
available in the office of the Village Treasurer. No person shall fail or
refuse to comply with any such rules or regulations.
   Until such time as rules and regulations are promulgated under this section,

890.01 INTRODUCTION.
   In an effort to spur development of the Village's industrial sector, the
Village of Valley View has designated a Community Reinvestment Area pursuant to
State law. A Community Reinvestment Area is an area within which special tax
incentives may be offered by contract to businesses which agree to invest in
capital improvements and/or create and/or retain jobs. Tax incentives will be
offered provided these program guidelines are met and a substantial investment
is made. Jobs must be created and maintained. Each contract with a business
within the zone relating to jobs, investment and tax incentives must be
submitted to Council for approval.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Community Reinvestment Area is to encourage as much
investment and job creation as possible within the boundaries of the Community
Reinvestment Area. Maintaining jobs is also a priority. Each contract
negotiated with a local business shall be designed to spur capital investment
while creating and maintaining jobs. In return, the Village will agree to
provide certain tax incentives under the circumstances of each transaction.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.03 ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES.
   Only those businesses that are "qualified by financial responsibility and
business experience to create and preserve employees opportunities in the area
to improve the economic climate of the municipal corporation..." and falling
within the purview of Ohio R.C. 3735.67 may apply for the tax incentives
available. For expansion, renovation or occupation as defined in Ohio R.C.
3735.67, the standards therein shall apply. Particularly, an expenditure to
alter or repair a vacant facility must be equal to at least 20% of the market
value of the facility prior to such expenditures, as determined for the
purposes of local property taxation. No abatement shall be granted for real
estate taxes on an existing building except as applies to the 20% expenditure
for alterations or repairs.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.04 ASSISTANCE.
   Abatement of real and personal property taxes may be granted upon approval
of the Village Council in accordance with the following schedules:
Period of Abatement of All Real Estate Added Full-Time Employees From New

7-92; Ord. 96-4-9. Passed 4-2-96.)
890.05 INCENTIVES ESSENTIAL.
   The number of employees required for each step of incentives shall be the
number of new employees employed in the Village, which may include the
employees brought from another city, village or township. Any business
interested in receiving the tax incentives must show that the incentives
requested are essential to cause the investment and, if not for the available
tax incentives, the investment would not have been made.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.06 DEGREE OF INVESTMENT REQUIRED.
   Only businesses that agree to make a substantial investment in either real
property shall be eligible to receive the benefits available under the program.
The amount of investment needed to qualify as a substantial investment shall
depend on the facts and circumstances of each applying business.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89; Ord. 89-4-3. Passed 4-4-89.)
890.07 LOCATION WITHIN THE ZONE.

comply with all applicable local, County and State regulations pertaining to
the Community Area Reinvestment Program including Zoning and Building Codes.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.09 PRINCIPALS ONLY.
   Only individuals who are principally involved as an owner or manager of a
business interested in the Community Reinvestment Area tax incentives may
negotiate with Village officials, regarding the specific incentives available
under the terms of any investment agreement, and only individuals authorized by
corporate resolution may enter into any agreement for the corporation
hereunder. Landlords of property, rather than brokers, may negotiate for tax
incentives relative to real property improvements. If other than owners of a
business apply to tax incentives, the incentive may be given only upon
verification that the business will be the recipient of the incentive.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.10 TAX INCENTIVE REVIEW COUNCIL.
   Pursuant to State law, a Community Reinvestment Housing Council will be
created to monitor compliance with the terms of any agreement approved by the
Village Council. This Community Reinvestment Housing Council shall review all
agreements to determine whether the businesses have complied with their terms
and shall make recommendations regarding them to the Village Council. This
Village Council shall review each agreement for tax incentives at least once
each year to determine whether the recipient has complied with the requirements
as to the number of people employed and the amount of investment and may take
any action available to a party to a contract to obtain compliance with the
agreement, including reducing or rescinding the incentives initially granted.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.11 VILLAGE TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACT.
   All interested parties must contact and negotiate directly with the Village
of Valley View. The Village may change the number of years of tax incentive
granted if an individual circumstance warrants such action.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.12 CONTINUING OBLIGATION.
   During the term of any approved agreement, the business involved must
continue to cooperate with Village officials by providing any information
requested to ensure compliance with the terms of the tax incentive agreement.
(Ord. 89-2-9. Passed 2-7-89.)
890.13 DEADLINE.
   Pursuant to State law, the deadline for executing tax incentive agreements
shall be December 31, 1992. Any agreement negotiated prior to that time
providing tax incentives for a period extending beyond that deadline shall
remain in full force and effect until the end of the term or termination.

within the County. If the owner of such property resides outside the County,
the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Village for two consecutive weeks.
   Such owner shall have thirty days during which to make the necessary
improvements by construction or repair of a public sidewalk. The thirty-day
period shall commence from the date of giving notice or following the period of
advertisement.

then the Service Director or the Village Engineer shall establish the grade and
the Director shall order the installation or repair of the sidewalk under the
overall sidewalk contract of the Village as provided in Section
1030.10. The installation and/or repair of such sidewalk shall be supervised by
the Director.

be forwarded to the owner at his or her tax mailing address, as shown in the
records of the County, by registered mail, return receipt requested. If any
notice required to be given by registered mail, return receipt requested, is
not delivered to such owner or his or her agent as evidenced by the postal
return thereon, it shall then be advertised in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Village for a period of not less than two weeks.
   The statement shall include the cost of repair and/or installation, the cost
of the notice, twenty dollars ($20.00) for establishing the grade and
supervision for each lot as shown by the subdivision plat records and all other
necessary expenses. The owner shall thereafter have thirty days during which to
pay such expense. If it is not paid at the expiration of the thirty-day period,
the cost shall thereupon constitute a lien upon the lots and lands so benefited
and a tax shall be levied therefor. The Clerk shall certify such tax lien to
the County Auditor.
   The Clerk shall receive five dollars ($5.00) per parcel, as shown by the
permanent parcel number of the County, for certifying such tax lien to the
County Auditor, who shall make his or her usual charge for servicing such tax
lien. The charges of the Clerk and the County Auditor shall constitute a lien
upon the lots and lands benefited by such sidewalks.
   The County Auditor shall place such lien for collection upon the duplicate

   The Service Director, with the approval of Council, shall estimate, during
the fourth month of every year, the number of square feet of sidewalk that will
be laid in the Village during such year, if available funds, circumstances and
conditions permit. He or she shall thereafter, without further authorization,
advertise for bids for the laying of concrete sidewalks, in accordance with
Village specifications and the estimate, reserving to the Village the option to
order more or less as circumstances and conditions warrant. Council shall award
a contract to the lowest and most responsible bidder, who shall thereafter lay
sidewalks required by the Village during the balance of such calendar year.
Such bid shall provide that the price is to be based on normal grade
situations. In the performance of individual jobs involving grades that require
filling with or removal of earth or other materials, not including cinders and
slag, the Service Director shall reach an agreement with the contractor for the
reasonable cost of the earth removal or fill.
(Ord. 87-9-4. Passed 11-3-87.)

is necessary along the side line of a corner lot, and the construction of such
sidewalk is performed by the Village or its subcontractor, and the corner lot
owner has previously paid for or is in the process of paying for a new sidewalk
installation along the frontage of his or her corner lot, the Clerk shall allow
the corner lot owner a credit for such frontage sidewalk installation based on
the percentage of frontage sidewalk measured against the side line sidewalk
installation. This section shall not apply to new construction in the Village
where an owner, builder or contractor is required by the Village to install
front and side line sidewalks.
(Ord. 87-9-4. Passed 11-3-87.)

            1.   Show delineation and sequence of subdrainage units which
comprise the area proposed for development.
            2.   Indicate the hydraulic length of slope per individual
subdrainage unit and the length of the natural or man-made watercourse which
accommodates the surface runoff from each subdrainage unit.
            3.   Indicate within the legend the average percent slope, erosion
factor (K) and runoff curve number (CN) per the individual subdrainage areas.
            4.   Include a hydrograph using the TR55, Type II Rainfall
Distribution Pattern over a 24-hour period for the following return intervals:
1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year storms. Hydrographs for each of the
recurrence intervals shall be produced for both the existing and proposed
conditions.
            5.   The 24-hour rainfall depths in Table B shall be utilized to
quantify the storm water runoff for the existing and proposed conditions.

      (18)   Calculations for the design of storm water management facilities
shall demonstrate the following for each subdrainage unit:
         A.   The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the site does not exceed the peak rate of runoff
from a one-year frequency, 24-hour storm occurring on the same site under pre-
development conditions.
         B.   Storms of less frequent occurrence (greater return periods) than
the critical storm, shall have a proposed peak rate of runoff less than the
existing peak rate of runoff.
         C.   The overflow spillway elevation shall be set one foot above the
100-year storm elevation and the surrounding berm elevation shall set minimally
one foot higher than the overflow spillway.
      (19)   Calculation of a critical storm for each subdrainage unit of the
site shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Calculate by appropriate hydrologic methods, such as the NRCS
Technical Release 55 (TR55) the total volume of runoff from a one-year
frequency, 24-hour storm occurring on the development area before and after
development. For redevelopment sites, the pre- developed condition for existing
impervious surfaces shall be defined as grassland in good hydrologic condition
for the pre-developed peak discharge rates, critical storm and volume storage
calculations.
         B.   From the volumes determined in above, determine the percentage
increase in volume of runoff due to the proposed development, and using this
percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from Table C.
Table C
24-Hour Critical Storm Runoff Rate
If the percentage of increase in runoff volume is:
Equal to or greater than And less than The critical storm runoff rate will be
                                       limited to:

         C.   The Village Engineer shall approve or reject any calculation
method based on its technical validity for the given situation. Downstream
capacity may further reduce maximum discharge requirements.
         D.   When calculating runoff for post construction areas, assume an
impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete except in the instances of
engineered permeable pavement systems. When a combination of impervious area
reduction and storm water quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20%
reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20% of
the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (20)   List TMDLs applicable for the site and demonstrate that
appropriate BMPs or storm water control measures (SCMs) have been selected to
address these TMDLs. (A TMDL identifier for Northeast Ohio communities is
available at http://www.neohiostormwater.coin/)
      (21)   For subdivided developments, a detail drawing of a typical
individual lot showing standard individual lot erosion and sediment control
practices. This does not remove the responsibility to designate specific
erosion and sediment control practices in the SWP3 for areas such as steep
slopes, stream banks, drainage ways, and riparian zones.
   (e)   Storm Water Management Facility Design Criteria.
      (1)   Runoff from all drainage area tributary to the storm water
management facility must be conveyed to the facility for all design storms up
to and including the 100-year storm.
      (2)   A vehicular access drive and permanent easements must be provided
from a public roadway to the outlet control device as approved by the Village
Engineer.
      (3)   While implementing SCMs, attempt to preserve natural existing
vegetative buffer strips, and phase construction operations to disturb minimal
land at any one time. Designate tree preservation areas or other similar
protected areas.
   (f)   Storm Water Basins.
      (1)   The outlet structure and/or riser shall be located in the
embankment for maintenance purposes.
      (2)   An emergency spillway is to be provided on all storm water basins.
Emergency spillways must be designed to convey flood flows safely past the
embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS standards and
specifications. The emergency spillway shall have a 100-year design storm
capacity unless exempted in writing by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   All embankments shall be designed in accordance with the
specifications in the current edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land
Development manual, the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide for Cuyahoga County,
and the Ohio EPA standards.
         A.   All pond grading shall have a maximum slope of 3:1 and shall
incorporate safety features to ensure public safety.
         B.   The primary spillway opening shall be constructed so as to not
permit access to the public and other non-maintenance personnel.
   (g)   Off-Site Storm Water Control Facilities.
      (1)   Exceptions to requiring permanent on-site runoff control on the
site may be considered by the Village Engineer provided the applicant can prove
that:
      (2)   The intent and standards of this chapter for runoff control can be
best achieved by the utilization of off-site storm water control facilities.
      (3)   Runoff from the site can be conveyed to off-site storm water
facilities in a manner and by means which satisfy or surpass the standards of
this chapter.
      (4)   The applicant has ownership of or the right to use the off-site
facility in question.
   (h)   Underground Storm Water Facilities.
      (1)   Underground storm water control facilities may be constructed to
provide storm water management for development sites as approved by the Village
Engineer.
      (2)   Voids in the stone aggregate around underground pipes or chambers
are not to be included in the volume calculations for underground detention
storm water management facilities.

1050.55 EASEMENTS.
   Access to storm water management practices as required by the Storm Water
Program Manager for inspections and maintenance shall be granted by easements.

   (a)   The easements shall be recorded in the name of the applicable
maintenance organization and the Village.
   (b)   Easements shall be included in the inspection and maintenance
agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Water Management Plan.
   (c)   Such easements shall be not less than 25 feet in width, in addition to
the width of the ditch, channel, or other facility it is to serve. Access
easements of this type shall be provided on one side of the flood control or
storm drainage ditch, channel, or similar type facility.
   (d)   Access along the initial drainage system shall be by means of
easements. Such easements shall be not less than 25 feet in width, with a
minimum ten-foot width on either side of the centerline.
   (e)   Access adjacent to storage facilities shall consist of a 25-foot
easement in the case of dry detention basins and a 25-foot easement with a 25-
foot level bench in the case of wet retention basins, measured from the top of
the bank, and shall include the storage facility itself.
   (f)   Easements for the emergency flow ways shall be a minimum of 25 feet in
width, or larger if required by the Village Engineer.
   (g)   Flood control or storm drainage easements containing underground
facilities shall have a minimum width of 25 feet.

easement of trees, shrubbery or plantings with woody growth characteristics,
against the construction therein of buildings, accessory buildings, fences,
walls or any other obstructions to the free flow of storm water and the
movement of inspectors and maintenance equipment, and against the changing of
final grade from that described by the grading plan.
(Ord. 2015-3-5. Passed 4-7-15; Ord. 2017-3-16. Passed 5-2-17.)
1050.56 MAINTENANCE.
   Maintenance of permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including on-
site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, shall
be performed in accordance with the Village Manual.
(Ord. 2015-3-5. Passed 4-7-15; Ord. 2017-3-16. Passed 5-2-17.)
1050.57 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, non-sediment
pollution controls continued therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to the commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and drainage, including but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers, and
public lands. It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of
contractor(s) responsible for implementing the SWT3 and providing that
information to the community engineer or the administrator of the code.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area, shall use conservation planning
and practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the
following standards. Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed and
maintained effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the
course of earth disturbing activities.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion and deposition of sediment from
occurring.
   (b)   Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Non-structural
preservation measures are also available. The SWP3 must make use of such
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
the existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a fifty-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct storm water to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize storm water infiltration. Infiltration facilities should
be designed to meet all criteria in Rainwater and Land Development.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt
fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to silt fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size of the
drainage area.
 
Maximum Drainage Area (In Acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a Particular
Linear Feet of Silt Fence Based on      Drainage Area
Slope
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to
control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw bale
barriers are not acceptable. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify a
diameter of filter socks or other acceptable perimeter controls.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices. Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, pipe slope
drains, and diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and grubbing will be done in two or more phases. The first
phase will include only those locations necessary to install the perimeter soil
erosion, sediment, and storm water control BMPs. After the perimeter controls
are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of clearing and grubbing
may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices. Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth-disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls, and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days
from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is permanently re-stabilized. As construction progresses and
the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
   Table 2: Permanent Stabilization

                                        first.
 
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds. A sediment settling pond is required for any
one of the following conditions:
      (1)   Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
      (2)   Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of
silt fence or other sediment barriers;
      (3)   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of inlet
protection; or
      (4)   Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more acres of
disturbed land. Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in
writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner
demonstrated to be equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
      (5)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include ten or more acres
disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must
be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
      (6)   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than ten
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be used.
      (7)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1,800 cubic
feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and
1,000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principal) spillway.
      (8)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 48 hours, or meet the
criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual, whichever is most
stringent. Sediment traps shall also provide both a sediment storage zone and
dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be constructed consistent with
the specifications of the latest Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
      (9)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width; a length to width radio of 4:1 is recommended.
      (10)   The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling pond
must be less than or equal to five feet.
      (11)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (12)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (13)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
      (14)   The design, installation, and maintenance of erosion and sediment
controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity, and
duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting storm water runoff and soil
characteristics including the range of soil particle sizes expected to be
present on the site.
      (15)   The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of
sediment basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the
pond provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering
zone. As such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be
no discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage
zone and the discharge of storm water within the dewatering zone shall only
occur through the skimmer. The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be
calculated by one of the following methods: Method 1: The volume of the
sediment storage zone shall be 1000 ft 3 per disturbed acre within the
watershed of the basin. Method 2: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall
be the volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other
generally accepted erosion prediction model.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, including yard basins, unless the storm drain system drains to
a sediment settling pond and is exempted in writing by the Village Engineer and
thereafter approved by Village Council. Straw, hay bales, and filter socks are
not acceptable forms of inlet protection. In areas where construction will be
ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection shall be maintained
until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as determined by the
Village Engineer. Catch basins near construction sites shall be maintained and
cleaned regularly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
      (2)   All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more
acres will require a sediment settling pond.
      (3)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
and videotape the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. All
sediments shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
The Village shall be provided with two copies of the videotape.
   (k)   Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets. All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains, and all other drains will be outletted at the
bottom of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the
water being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing
erosion of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that
the water is outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near or Crossing Streams and Wetlands.
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or other material shall be dumped or placed
into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip, or erode
into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by the
Approving Authority and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams setbacks required by the community will be implemented in
accordance with the Village's Riparian Ordinance.
      (6)   Concentrated storm water runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands shall
be converted to diffused flow through the use of level spreaders or other such
appropriate measures before the runoff enters the wetland. The flow should be
released such that no erosion would occur downslope. Level spreaders may be
needed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
      (7)   For the protection of surface waters, the community engineer may
allow modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands, or other surface waters
if necessary while following EPA standards.
      (8)   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, 25 percent of
the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of a box culvert or pipe arch
must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or conveyance must be sized
to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
   (m)   Construction Entrance.
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public roads
or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Village Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned and
installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils.
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the Cuyahoga County Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Village Engineer may require detailed soil reports when deemed
necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled, or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, ground water conditions, and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 3:1,
or as otherwise approved by the Village Engineer.
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels. Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post- development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, has 80% vegetative
density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is
mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices. All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Village until all temporary
soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed have been
removed, properly disposed of, and any trapped sediment has been stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction. The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days;
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the State; and
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water, care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections.
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven
calendar days, and within 24 hours of a 0.5-inch or greater rainfall event
until the maintenance organization obtains certification reflecting the site's
stability from a the Village's Engineer. Such certification does not relieve
the permittee from meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every
month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to
weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is
frozen). A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the
following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen
conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e., more
than one month); land-disturbance activities have been suspended; and the
beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented.
      (4)   Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and signed
by the qualified inspection personnel representative and submitted to the
Village Engineer. At a minimum, the inspection report must include:
         A.   The inspection date along with estimated construction dates;
         B.   Names, titles, and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection;
         C.   Contact information for construction site operators or
contractors;
         D.   A copy of the permit requirements (attaching a copy of the EPA
NPDES Construction General Permit is acceptable)
         E.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection
including the timing, duration, and depth of any storms;
         F.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of the inspection;
         G.   Location(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from
the site;
         H.   Location(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained;
         I.   Location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location;
         J.   Location(s) where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist
at the time of the inspection; and
         K.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan and implementation dates.
      (5)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (6)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the SMP shall be
observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.
      (8)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (10)   Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
observed to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed.
      (11)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten days of the
inspection.
      (12)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection. The
amended plan must be submitted to, and approved by, the Village Engineer prior
to installation of the new control practice.
      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this it must be installed within ten days
from the date of inspection.
      (14)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.

1051.05 RIPARIAN SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of, riparian areas, rivers,
streams, and other natural watercourses within the Community contributes to the
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. The specific purpose and
intent of this part of these regulations is to regulate uses and developments
within riparian and wetland setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian
and wetland areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling,
transforming and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Benefit the Community economically by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of residents; and by contributing to the
scenic beauty and environment of the Community, and thereby preserving the
character of the Community, the quality of life of the residents of the
Community, and corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect these services
of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and
uses within a riparian setback along designated watercourses in the Community.
   (c)   Applicability and Compliance.
      (1)   These regulations shall apply to:
         A.   All lands that are within the jurisdiction of the Community and
that border designated watercourses as defined in these regulations.
         B.   These regulations shall apply to property subdivision/property/
parcel split plan approvals, site plan approvals, and land development plan
approvals requested of the Community.
         C.   These regulations shall apply to all building permits, which
involve soil- disturbing activities.
      (2)   The Community shall issue no approvals or permits without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations.

                           integrity of the stream ecosystem. It is the most
                           sensitive area of the stream corridor and includes
Preserved buffer           the stream channel and the required setback from the
                           ordinary high water mark. In order to protect
                           natural functions of the corridor, this area should
                           contain undisturbed natural vegetation.
                           An area that protects key components of the stream
                           and provides distance and transitions between up
                           land development and preserved buffer. Activities in
                           this area impact the function of the preserved
Managed buffer             buffer, as well as the stream corridor, and it
                           begins immediately adjacent to the preserved buffer.
                           In order to protect natural function of the
                           corridor, this area should contain native vegetation
                           and limited land disturbance.
                           An area that prevents encroachment into the steam
                           corridor by more intense and conventional
                           development. Activities in this area impact the
                           function of the stream corridor, and it begins
Limited development buffer immediately adjacent to the managed buffer. Limited
                           development activity is allowed in this area,
                           provided it is accessory to a use in one of the
                           other buffer areas or involves site design practices
                           that eliminate, minimize or mitigate impacts of
                           runoff into the stream corridor.

1051.07 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Community may grant a variance from this regulation as provided
herein. In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or practical
difficulty such as to justify the granting of a variance, the Community shall
consider the potential harm or reduction in riparian area functions that may be
caused by a proposed structure or use.
   (b)   In making a variance determination, the Community shall consider the
following:
      (1)   Varying the front, rear and side yard setback before the riparian
setbacks are varied.
      (2)   Variances should be evaluated on a case by case basis for asphalt
or concrete paving in the riparian and wetland setbacks in any situation where
gravel or porous pavement (i.e., porous pavers, and similar products) will do
the job.
   (c)   In making a variance determination, the Community may consider the
following:
      (1)   A parcel existing at the time of passage of this chapter is made
unbuildable.
      (2)   The soil type natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the Community's flood damage prevention regulations may be used as guidance
when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or
other functions of the riparian area. This determination shall be based on
sufficient technical and scientific data.
      (4)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (5)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in a riparian setback through
variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing to the extent
possible, and to include best management practices necessary to minimize soil
erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (6)   Modifying parking requirements before varying the riparian setback.
      (7)   Modifying building shape, size or design to avoid or minimize
intrusion into the riparian setback.
      (8)   Whether the variance will increase the likelihood for flood or
erosion damage to either the applicant's property or to other properties.
(Ord. 2013-11-3. Passed 12-19-13.)
1051.08 BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (a)   When an applicant or his or her designated representative disputes the
boundary of a riparian setback or the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit
documentation to the Community which describes the boundary, the applicant's
proposed boundary, and justification for the proposed boundary change.
   (b)   The Community shall evaluate this documentation and shall make a
written determination within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60
days, a copy of which shall be submitted to the applicant. If during this
evaluation the Community requires further information, it may be required of
the applicant. In the event that the Community requests such additional
information, the 60-day limit on the Community's review shall be postponed
until the applicant provides such information.
   (c)   Any party aggrieved by any riparian setback determination under this
regulation may appeal to the Village Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2013-11-3. Passed 12-19-13.)
1051.09 INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)   The delineation of riparian setbacks shall be inspected by the
Community, as follows:
      (1)   Prior to any soil-disturbing activities authorized by the Community
under for a property subdivision/property/parcel split, land development plan,
and/or building permit, the applicant or his or her designated representative
shall provide the Community with at least five working days' notice prior to
starting soil-disturbing or land-clearing activities.
      (2)   Any time evidence is brought to the attention of the Community that
uses or structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to violate the
provisions of these regulations.
(Ord. 2013-11-3. Passed 12-19-13.)

owner or person responsible for the development area, or person performing the
work, and shall state the conditions under which such work may be resumed;
provided, however, in instances where immediate action is deemed necessary for
public safety or the public interest, the Community Engineer may require that
work be stopped upon verbal order pending issuance of the written order.
   (d)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the Community, by or through its Law Director and/or any of his or her
assistants, from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a court of
proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development or to restrain, correct
or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of this

   (b)   The owner or allotter, or his successors or assigns, shall file with
the Clerk a maintenance bond, in a form approved by the Village Solicitor, to
insure that the improvements covered by the performance bond required under
Section
1224.07(b) are properly maintained for a period of two years after their
acceptance by the Village. The bond shall be in the amount of ten percent of
the performance bond under which such improvements were constructed pursuant to
Section
1224.07(b).
   (c)   The owner or allotter, or his successors or assigns, shall, prior to
the commencement of any work to improve areas dedicated to public uses, file
with the Clerk, in a form approved by the Village Solicitor, comprehensive
general liability insurance coverage insuring the owner or allotter, or his
successors or assigns, and the Village, in the amount of five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000) all-occurrence coverage and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)
property damage, which coverage shall be continued in effect until such
improvements are accepted.
   (d)   At no time prior to the acceptance of the dedication of any street by

maintain a conspicuous sign at the entrance to each street being developed,
which sign shall inform the general public that the street is not an accepted
dedicated Village street, that the residents thereon are not entitled to
Municipal services thereon (except for police and fire protection, when
possible) and that the Village is not responsible for the maintenance of any
street improvement until such time as the dedication of the street has been
officially accepted through councilmanic action. Such sign must be approved by
the Village Solicitor.
(Ord. 69-2-2. Passed 2-4-69.)
1224.10 CERTIFICATION TO COUNTY RECORDER.
   The Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to certify a copy of this
chapter to the Recorder of Cuyahoga County.
(Ord. 63-6-4. Passed 7-9-63.)
1224.11 DEPOSIT FOR INVESTIGATION AND INSPECTION OF PLATS.
   At the time of the submission of the preliminary plat or proposed
subdivision, the developer shall deposit with the Treasurer an amount of money
as determined by Council, but which shall not be less than one thousand dollars
($1,000), to cover the cost and expense of such investigation as may be
necessary to determine whether such proposed plat conforms to the requirements
of this chapter. When the proposed subdivision does not include more than five
lots, the amount to be deposited shall not be less than three hundred dollars
($300). The cost and expense of investigating the preliminary plat, the record
map or dedication plat and any other accompanying plats shall be deducted from
such deposit. If such expenditure exceeds the deposit, such excess shall be
paid into the Village Treasury by the applicant prior to the approval of the
plat or acceptance of the dedication. If the deposit exceeds the expenditure,
the balance shall be refunded to the applicant.
   At the time the plans and specifications for any improvements are submitted
for approval, there shall be deposited with the Treasurer an amount of money as
determined by Council, which shall not be less than two percent of the
estimated cost of all improvements to be installed to cover the cost and
expense of such investigation as may be necessary to determine whether such
improvements conform to the requirements of this chapter and to cover the cost
and expense of the inspection of the installation of the improvements. The cost
and expense of such investigation and inspection shall be deducted from such
deposit. If such expenditures exceed the deposit, the excess shall, upon
demand, be paid forthwith into the Village Treasury. If the deposit exceeds the
expenditure, the balance shall be refunded to the applicant.
(Ord. 77-3-4. Passed 3-15-77; Ord. 2017-3-14. Passed 3-7-17.)
1224.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land within or
without the Village, willfully transfers any lot, parcel or tract of such land
from or in accordance with a plat of a subdivision before such plat has been
recorded in the office of the County Recorder or waived as provided in Section
1224.06(d), shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) or more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for each lot, parcel or tract of land so sold. The
description of such lot, parcel or tract by metes and bounds in the deed of
transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the penalty provided in this
section.
   If such land is within the Village, such sum may be recovered in a civil
action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by the Village Solicitor
in the name of the Village and for the use of the Street Repair Fund thereof.
   The sale of lots, parcels or tracts from a plat of a subdivision on which
any and all areas indicated as streets or open grounds are expressly indicated
to be for the exclusive use of the abutting or other owners in such subdivision
and not public streets, ways or grounds, shall not serve to exempt the seller
from the requirements of this chapter or from the penalty herein provided.
   (b)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter for which no
penalty is otherwise provided shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars
($500.00). A separate offense shall he deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1228.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Valley View, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village as identified in Section
1228.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1228.43, Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village Hall at 6848 Hathaway Road, Valley
View, Ohio.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Appeal" means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   "Base flood" is the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the
one percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   "Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE)" means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one to three feet).
   (e)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   "Enclosure below the lowest floor." See "Lowest floor."
   (h)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)," issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" is the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood or flooding" is a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)" is usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" is an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood insurance risk zones" are zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood insurance study (FIS)" is the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Flood protection elevation (FPE)" is the base flood elevation. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway."
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" is a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure" is any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" is an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of map change (LOMC)" is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   "Letter of map amendment (LOMA)" is a revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      (2)   "Letter of map revision (LOMR)" is a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   "Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)" is a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" is the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" is a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park," as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction" means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of
Valley View Flood Insurance Rate Map, February 18, 1981, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,

review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1228.60 through
1228.65, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.31 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other

existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that

      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible; or
         B.   Paragraph (a)(2), items A. and C. through E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1228.29(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within twenty days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.63 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in paragraphs (b)(1) to (11) hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 2010-10-4. Passed 11-2-10.)
1228.64 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.

(Ord. 64-3-2. Passed 11-23-65; Ord. 65-5-2. Passed 9-14-65.)
1242.02 ZONE MAP.
   The locations and boundaries of the districts are shown on the map prepared
by the Village Engineer, dated October 12, 1978, entitled "Zone Map of the
Village of Valley View," a copy of which is on file with the Village Clerk. The
Zone Map and all notations, references, data and other information shown
thereon, including any setback building lines that are depicted thereon, are
hereby adopted, incorporated in and made a part of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 53-5-1. Passed 6-2-53; Ord. 79-1-9. Passed 1-2-79.)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: An amended Zoning Map, designated "Zoning Map II," was
adopted by the Village for the purpose of locating wireless communication
facilities in districts or overlay zones. A copy of Zoning Map II, which is
attached as Exhibit A to Ordinance 97-1-8, passed February 4, 1997, may be
obtained, at cost, from the Clerk Treasurer.)
1242.03 INTERPRETATION AND DETERMINATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   All boundary lines between districts shown on the Zone Map shall be
interpreted and determined as follows:
   (a)   Where boundaries apparently follow lot lines and are not more than ten
feet therefrom, the lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   (b)   Where boundaries apparently follow streets or alleys, the centerlines
of such streets or alleys shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   (c)   In all other cases, the location of any boundary line, unless
indicated by dimensions on the Zone Map, shall be determined by use of the
scale appearing thereon.

permit and/or certificate of use compliance shall be issued or refused in
writing by the Inspector of Buildings within fifteen days after the filing of
an application therefor. The application for a building permit and/or
certificate of use compliance shall be accompanied by a drawing showing the
dimensions of the parcel of land to be built upon, drawn to scale and clearly
indicating the size of the proposed building to be erected, the setback
building lines, the yard areas and the distances to buildings on abutting

is being done in violation of this Zoning Code, no person shall proceed further
upon such work and such work shall be suspended forthwith. When any building or
premises are being used or occupied in violation of this Zoning Code, no person
shall continue such use or occupancy and such use or occupancy shall be

(Ord. 53-5-1. Passed 6-2-53.)
1244.05 NOTICE OF SUSPENSION; PROTECTION OF SUSPENDED WORK.
   The Inspector of Buildings is hereby directed to notify the owner or his
agent of such unlawful work, use or occupancy and to cause a written or printed
notice of the suspension thereof to be posted conspicuously and as near as

deface, cover or conceal such notice or do any further work on such building or
premises until such notice is rescinded by the Inspector of Buildings or the
Planning Commission. However, the Inspector may direct such covering or
protection to be made as the public safety requires, and the person performing
the suspended work, use or occupancy shall immediately make such cover and
protection as directed.
(Ord. 78-5-2. Passed 5-2-78.)
1244.06 SEPARABILITY.
   Should any section, subsections limitation, provision or regulation of or

1246.001 DELEGATION OF POWERS TO PLANNING COMMISSION.
   There are hereby delegated to the Planning Commission all powers and
functions now or hereafter authorized by law to be delegated to any
administrative board with respect to any planning or zoning commission,
including, without prejudice to the generality of this delegation, the
following powers and functions.
(Ord. 78-5-2. Passed 5-2-78.)
1246.01 PLANNING COMMISSION TO HEAR APPEALS.
   The Planning Commission shall hear and determine all appeals from the
refusal of the Inspector of Buildings, because of anything contained in this
Zoning Code, to issue a building permit and/or certificate of use compliance
and from any decision or action of the Inspector in the administration or
enforcement of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 78-5-2. Passed 5-2-78.)
1246.02 FILING OF APPEALS.
   Any person may appeal a decision or action of the Inspector of Buildings in
the enforcement and administration of this Zoning Code to the Planning
Commission within ten days after the date of such decision or action, by filing
with the Planning Commission a written notice of such appeal. The Planning
Commission shall hear and determine such appeals within twenty days after the
filing thereof.
(Ord. 78-5-2. Passed 5-2-78.)
1246.025 APPEAL OF COMMISSION'S DECISION TO COUNCIL.
   Any appeal heard and determined by the Planning Commission under this
chapter may be appealed to Council by any person so appealing to the Planning
Commission, by the same procedural method provided in Section
1246.02. Council may then, by majority vote, act de novo upon the matter,
subject to the limitations and conditions applicable to the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 78-5-2. Passed 5-2-78.)
1246.03 VARIANCES GENERALLY.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may, in individual cases, after public hearing
and subject to such conditions and safeguards as it may establish, permit such
exceptions to and variations from the regulations of this Zoning Code as will
not be contrary to the public interest, so that the general purpose and intent
of this Zoning Code shall be observed and substantial justice done. Council
may, by the vote of four members of Council, override the decision of the
Planning Commission granting variances, provided, however, that the vote to do
so must be made at the regular Council meeting immediately after the Planning
Commission meeting granting said variance. Variances granted pursuant to this
section, unless acted upon, shall expire in one year.
   (b)   Notices of the request for a variance shall be delivered to the
address of the abutting property owners via personal service, regular mail or
email, and recorded by the Building Inspector at least five days before the
Planning Commission meeting to discuss said variance. In the event the parcel
is vacant, the notice of said hearing shall be mailed via regular mail to the
last known address of the owner of the property in the manner prescribed above.
Notice to abutting property owners shall state the nature of the request and an
explanation of their right to object. Objections shall be made in person at the
Planning Commission meeting, in writing via regular mail, or by email by the
owner or the owner's representative.
(Ord. 99-3-4. Passed 6-1-99; Ord. 2023-2-10. Passed 4-4-23.)
1246.04 GRANTING VARIANCES; TYPES OF VARIANCES.
   (a)   Conditions for Granting. The Planning Commission shall have the power,
in specific cases, to vary the application of certain provisions of this Zoning
Code, in order that the public health, safety and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice done, for the following reasons:
      (1)   When the literal application of the provisions of this Zoning Code
would result in unnecessary hardships peculiar to the property involved and not
based on conditions created by the owner. A theoretical loss or limiting
possibilities of economic advantage are general hardships, not unnecessary
hardships;
      (2)   Where other exceptional circumstances or conditions (such as
topographical or geological conditions or the type of adjoining development)
are applicable only to the property involved or the intended use of the
property and do not apply to other property within the same zone, unless the
same exceptional circumstances prevail;
      (3)   Where granting of a variance will not be materially detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; and
      (4)   Where the granting of a variance will not be contrary to the
general purpose, intent and objectives of this Zoning Code.
   (a)   Residential Variances. When appealing for a residential variance, the
applicant shall submit an eight and one-half inch by eleven-inch sketch of the
request and a short statement of the desired variance. The Planning Commission
shall keep the application on file, along with meeting minutes, whether or not
the variance is granted.
   (b)   Industrial/Commercial/Business/All Other Variances. When appealing for
a variance or modification, the applicant shall state and substantiate the
claim that each of the four conditions listed in subsection (a) hereof exists,
and the Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove based on the validity
of the statement. An eleven-inch by seventeen-inch (or larger) scale drawing of
the request shall be submitted, graphically presenting the situation, as an aid
for the Inspector of Buildings.
(Ord. 94-10-7. Passed 12-6-94.)
1246.045 LAPSE OF VARIANCES; RECONSIDERATION OF DECISIONS.
   (a)   A variance, once granted, shall not be withdrawn or changed, unless
there is a change of circumstances or if, after the expiration of one year, no
substantial construction is done in accordance with the terms and conditions
for which such variance is granted. In such circumstances, the Inspector of
Buildings shall give a notice, in writing, and thirty days thereafter the
variance shall be deemed null and void, and all regulations governing the
premises in question shall revert to those in effect before the variance was
granted.
   (b)   If a variance as provided in Section
1246.03 has been denied by Council, then Council need not reconsider the
variance if it is resubmitted within six months after the date of the decision,
unless the underlying conditions have substantially changed.
(Ord. 94-10-8. Passed 12-6-94.)
1246.05 ALTERING TOPOGRAPHY; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   The removal of topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam, sand,
gravel, rock, stone, clay and other similar substances from the land results in
noise and the creation of large quantities of dust, which prove obnoxious to
inhabitants in the vicinity thereof, creates erosion, drainage problems, swamps
and lakes, frequently results in damage to adjoining properties by disturbing
the substructure thereof, tends to have a disrupting effect on ground water
supplies, results in other similar dangers to public health and safety, results
in unsightly and blighted areas unfit for other and useful purposes, thus
retarding or preventing the development of desirable residential, commercial
and industrial areas, depressing property and other values in the neighborhood,
permanently destroying the land and leaving it almost valueless for any purpose
and creates the highway hazards of heavy trucks and other equipment on the
roads and the scattering of earth and debris thereon, and, unless properly
planned, regulated and supervised, has an adverse effect upon the public peace,
health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, any person wishing to change the
contours of land by grading, excavating or filling, or desiring to remove
topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam, sand, gravel, rock, stone, clay and
other similar substances from land located in any area or place within the
Village, shall, prior to commencing or continuing any such operation, file with
the Village Engineer a written application for permission to carry on such
operations. Such application shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the applicant and the name and address of
the owner of the land, if different from those of the applicant shall be
included.
      (2)   A description of the land, with boundaries, upon which such
operations are proposed to take place shall be included. A map of the land,
showing its location and dimensions and indicating the part or parts thereof on
which it is desired to conduct grading, excavating, filling or removal
operations, shall accompany the application.
      (3)   The application shall include the method of operation to be
employed, the time within which such work is to be commenced and completed, the
existing and proposed topography of the land and its ultimate proposed use, the
type and nature of refilling, reseeding or replanting proposed and the name and
address of any person who is proposing to do the actual work of grading,
excavating, filling or removal. If any such agreement, contract, lease or other
arrangement is in writing, a copy thereof must be attached to the application;
if such is not in writing, a statement to that effect must be made in the
application.
      (4)   The application shall also contain a statement that the applicant
and the owner of the land will furnish a performance bond in a sum not to
exceed two thousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500) per acre, or fraction
thereof, included in the permit, if granted, for changing the contours of the
land by grading, excavating or filling or for removing topsoil or loam, and not
to exceed five thousand ($5,000) per acre, or fraction thereof, included in the
permit, if granted, for other removals in accordance with this Zoning Code.
      (5)   When deemed appropriate by the Village Engineer, any or all of the
following additional information may be required:
         A.   The areas of such premises which will be exposed at any one time;
         B.   The type of temporary vegetation and/or mulching which will be
used to protect the exposed areas of such premises during the construction of
any type of improvements thereon, the changes being made in the contours
thereof or in the removal or destruction of topsoil, trees and other vegetation
located thereon;
         C.   The location, construction and maintenance of sediment basins
(debris basins or silt traps) or other controlled measures on such premises;
         D.   The type of permanent and final vegetation and structures which
will be planted and installed on such premises and the time within which such
vegetation and structures are to be planted and installed; and
         E.   A description of the type of soil comprising such premises.
   (b)   Such application shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission by the
Village Engineer, together with a written report by him or her with respect to
the statements contained therein and his or her recommendations thereon.
   (c)   For parcels less than ten acres, the Planning Commission may request a
report from the Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District stating its
recommendations for adequate erosion and sediment control measures for the
proposed grading, excavating, filling or removal operation. After securing all
such information as it deems necessary, the Planning Commission shall set the
matter down for a public hearing and mail notice thereof to the applicant and
the owner of the land at the addresses given in the application not less than
five business days prior to the public hearing, excluding the day of
the mailing and including the day of the public hearing. If, after such
hearing, the Planning Commission determines that the granting of the
application will not adversely affect the public welfare, peace, health, safety
and convenience, it shall grant the application with the conditions relating to
the method of grading, excavating, filling or removal of the land or area on
which the operations are to be conducted, the terms of the permit, the amount
of topsoil or loam to be respread on the land, the amount of the removal which
may be permitted on the land, the refilling, reseeding or replanting of the
land, the drainage after removal and such other conditions as the Planning
Commission deems necessary for the protection of the public health, safety,
peace, convenience and welfare, which conditions shall be made a part of the
permit and constitute limitations thereon.
   (d)   For parcels ten acres or greater, the Planning Commission shall
request a report from the Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District stating
its recommendations for adequate erosion and sediment control measures for the
proposed grading, excavating, filling or removal operation. After securing all
such information as it deems necessary, the Planning Commission shall set the
matter down for a public hearing and mail notice thereof to the applicant and
the owner of the land at the addresses given in the application not less than
five business days prior to the public hearing, excluding the day of the
mailing and including the day of the public hearing. If, after such hearing,
the Planning Commission determines that the granting of the application will
not adversely affect the public welfare, peace, health, safety and convenience,
it shall grant the application with conditions relating to the method of
grading, excavating, filling or removal of the land or area on which the
operations are to be conducted, the terms of the permit, the amount of topsoil
or loam to be respread on the land, the amount of the removal which may be
permitted on the land, the refilling, reseeding or replatting of the land, the
drainage after removal and such other conditions as the Planning Commission
deems necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, peace,
convenience and welfare, which conditions shall be made a part of the permit
and constitute limitations thereon.
   (e)   No application shall be granted under this section except upon the
concurrence of not less than three members of the Planning Commission at least
one of whom shall be the member of Council serving on the Planning Commission.
An application granted by the Planning Commission not in compliance with the
requirements of this subsection shall be void.
   (f)   In the event the application is denied or is not granted in conformity
with subsection (c) or (d) hereof, notice thereof shall be mailed forthwith to
the applicant and the owner of the land at the addresses given in the
application.
   (g)   If the Planning Commission denies the application, or if the same is
not granted in conformity with the provisions of subsection (c) or (d) hereof,
the applicant or owner may appeal to Council by filing a written notice of such
appeal with the Village Clerk-Treasurer within thirty days from the date of the
mailing of the communication sent by the Planning Commission to the applicant
and the owner, as provided in subsection (f) hereof. The Village Clerk-
Treasurer shall then obtain from the Planning Commission the application,
reports, recommendations, documents and minutes, or copies thereof, relating to
the application and the action taken thereon by the Planning Commission and
submit the same to Council. Council, by majority vote, may act to move upon the
application, subject to the limitations and provisions applicable to the
Planning Commission.
   If the Planning Commission approves the application, then the Village Clerk-
Treasurer or Village Engineer shall obtain from the Planning Commission the
applications, reports, site plans, drawings, recommendations, documents and
minutes, or copies thereof, relating to the application and the action taken
thereon by the Planning Commission and submit the same to each Council member
within seven days of the meeting wherein the approval is granted. Council, by
majority vote, may override the granting of the application by the Planning
Commission and submit such in the form of minutes, a motion or other written
communication. The communication shall contain a statement of direction for the
Planning Commission bound at the time of the Council vote. A Council vote must
take place within thirty days of the Planning Commission's approval.
   (h)   If the application is granted, either by the Planning Commission or by
Council, the Village Engineer shall issue a permit containing the restrictions
imposed, if any, upon the posting of a bond, running in favor of the Village
and conditioned upon the performance of the permit in accordance with its
terms, in the amount fixed by the approving body, such bond to be signed by the
applicant, the owner and a surety company, or two good and sufficient sureties
satisfactory to the Mayor. No work is to be performed at the site until all
conditions of the permitting process are completed.
   (i)   The provisions of this section shall not be deemed or construed to
apply to any excavation or removal for a basement or foundation for any
proposed building for which a building permit has been issued and is in force
and effect. However, if such building is not commenced and carried forward, any
excavation or removal made preparatory thereto for a basement or foundation
shall be filled up and replanted.
   (j)   At the time of submission of the written application, the applicant
shall deposit with the Village Clerk-Treasurer an amount of money as determined
by the Village Engineer, not less than six hundred dollars ($600.00), to cover
the cost and expense of such investigation as may be necessary to fully review
such application and any accompanying maps, and report upon the same to the
Planning Commission. In case such expenditure exceeds the deposit, such excess
shall be paid into the Village Treasury by the applicant upon request of the
Village Clerk-Treasurer.
   If the application is granted, the applicant shall reimburse the Village
Clerk-Treasurer for any expenses incurred in connection with Village
supervision or inspection of the operations as outlined in the permit.
Statements for such expenses shall be submitted to the permit holder by the
Village Clerk-Treasurer and shall be subject to payment within thirty days of
receipt. Failure to pay such statements shall constitute grounds for the
revocation of the permit.
(Ord. 94-10-9. Passed 12-6-94.)
   (k)   The maximum period of time of a permit shall be two years. Upon the
expiration of a permit, the permit holder shall not be permitted to extend it
but may apply for a new permit under the conditions set forth in this section.
(Ord. 98-3-4. Passed 5-5-98.)
   (l)   This section shall not apply to residential lots under two acres,
except as provided in subsection (a)(1), (2) and (3) and subsection (i) hereof
and as further enumerated:
      (1)   Any application submitted for alteration of the topography of a
residential lot under two acres shall be reviewed by the Village Engineer and
any changes required by him shall be made before a permit is issued.
      (2)   If the application is granted, the Village Engineer shall issue a
permit containing the restrictions imposed.
      (3)   If the application is denied by the Village Engineer, the applicant
or owner may submit a written appeal to Council.
      (4)   After a permit has been issued, the Village Engineer shall inspect
the work in progress at least once a month. The Engineer shall also check the
final grading and drainage of the property before it is reseeded or replanted,
after vegetation is re-established, a final inspection shall be made by the
Village Engineer.
      (5)   The cost and expense of the review of the application, the issuance
of the permit and the inspections and grade checks made by the Village Engineer
shall be borne by the applicant. At the time of submission of the application,
the sum of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) shall be deposited with the Clerk-
Treasurer. Such costs and expenses shall be deducted from the deposit. If such
expenditures exceed the deposit, the balance shall, upon demand, be paid
forthwith into the Municipal Treasury. If the deposit exceeds the expenditures,
the balance shall be refunded to the applicant.
   (m)   This section shall not apply to minor filling and grading being done
in conjunction with finished landscaping as long as the grade is not altered
more than eight inches and the drainage of abutting properties is not adversely
affected.
(Ord. 94-10-9. Passed 12-6-94; Ord. 2000-4-7. Passed 5-2-00.)
1246.055 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense, and
shall constitute a third degree misdemeanor. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. The Village shall prosecute any violation of these
regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.
(Ord. 2014-6-3. Passed 6-3-14.)

   Council may from time to time and on its own motion or petition, after
public notice and hearing, amend this Zoning Code. Every such proposed

the access driveways on the frontage street of a corner lot shall be at least
forty feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street.
Whenever possible, driveways shall be spaced at not less than 120-foot
intervals, measured from the centerline of the driveways.

shall be not less than twelve feet so that a car may enter or leave the curb
lane without obstructing vehicles in other traffic lanes. The maximum curb cut
shall be limited to the width of the entrance or exit plus the radius of the
apron.
   (d)   Lighting. Lights for the illumination of buildings or grounds shall be
shielded so as not to be objectionable or hazardous to owners or users of
adjacent property or public streets.

1266.01 INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Extend space or screen undesirable views to reduce the impact of one
land use upon another;
   (b)   Increase soil water retention through landscaping requirements;
   (c)   Protect and preserve the appearance and property values of residential
uses from adverse effects of adjoining nonresidential uses; and
   (d)   Supplement land use planning and not be considered as its
substitution.
(Ord. 95-2-12. Passed 4-4-95.)
1266.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety, morals and
general welfare of the residents of the Village by providing for space
requirements and visual screen landscape buffers to remove, reduce, lessen or
absorb the shock of impact of incompatible uses of real properties between one
use or zone district and another.
(Ord. 95-2-12. Passed 4-4-95.)
1266.03 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Landscaping" means living materials, including, but not limited to,
grass, ground covers, shrubs, vines, hedges, trees and nonliving durable
material commonly used in landscape development.
   (b)   "Opacity" means the state of being impervious to rays of light,
measured by the observation of any two square-yard area lying between two feet
and ten feet from the ground.
   (c)   "Screen" means plant material or nonliving durable material,
including, but not limited to, walls, berms and decorative wood fencing.
   (d)   "Shrub" means a self-supporting, deciduous and/or evergreen species,
normally branched near the base, bushy and less than fifteen feet in height, as
normally grown in Cuyahoga County.
   (e)   "Tree" means a self-supporting, woody, deciduous and/or evergreen
plant with a well defined central stem, or a species of such plant, that
normally grows to a height of fifteen feet or more in Cuyahoga County.
   (f)   "Vine" means a plant that normally requires physical support to reach
mature form.
(Ord. 95-2-12. Passed 4-4-95.)
1266.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Materials. Landscape buffering may include, but shall not be limited
to, trees, shrubs, bushes, earth berms or a combination thereof.
   (b)   Screening. Screening shall consist of plant material or nonliving
durable landscape material.
   (c)   Buffered Areas.
      (1)   Location and width. Buffering shall be located on those less
restrictive portions of land bordering or abutting a more restrictive zone or
use district and shall be a minimum of ten feet in width. In Business
Districts, Industrial Districts, Light Manufacturing Districts and Office
Building, Research Laboratory and Light Manufacturing Districts, buffering
width shall not be less than fifty feet when bordering or abutting a Country
Home District. Plant material and screening shall be distributed within the
buffer area so as to provide the desired opacity and visual screening.
      (2)   Use. Designated buffered areas shall be used for no other purpose
than planting or screening. Required buffer areas shall not be used for open
retention basins or driveway access, unless approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (3)   Design. A buffered area shall be designed to permit access to
easement tracts to grantees to perform the functions for which the easements
were granted and to facilitate the use of such easement areas for fire
protection purposes.
      (4)   Opacity. Where buffering is required, the buffer material and
screening shall provide a maximum of eighty percent opacity in the summer and
sixty percent opacity in the winter when viewed from two feet to ten feet above
the ground level.
   (d)   Fences and Walls. Fences may be accepted or required as part of a
landscape buffer where traffic noise, parking areas and lights create a need
for a greater buffer. When used, they shall be of a decorative style and type.
Walls and berms may be used in unusual cases, as may be required by the
Planning Commission to fulfill the buffering requirements.
   (e)   Natural Planting Requirements. Where natural plantings and trees exist
in yards requiring buffering, such natural plantings and existing trees shall
be preserved and grades maintained so as to provide eighty percent summer
opacity and sixty percent winter opacity when viewed from two feet to ten feet
above ground level. Additional landscape material and screening may be required
to supplement the natural plantings to meet the desired opacity.
   (f)   Buffering Effect. The desired buffering shall be achieved not later
than twelve months after the initial installation. The Planning Commission may
extend this period of time when a hardship would be created because of expected
growth or material shortages, but the Commission shall not extend such period
beyond two years from the time the initial installation was to have been or has
been installed.
   (g)   Modification Requirements. The Commission may modify or change the
location of a buffer area continuous to side and rear property lines where
topographical problems prevent the installation of buffer materials or where
the buffering effect cannot be reasonably obtained at the lot line, such as in
the case of substantial grade elevation differences.
(Ord. 95-2-12. Passed 4-4-95.)
1266.05   MANDATORY BUFFERING; PLANS; BUFFERING OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   Landscape buffering shall be mandatory between Country Home Districts
and all other zoning districts and between different uses and zones abutting
Country Home Districts.
   (b)   All buffering requirements imposed under the provisions of this
chapter shall be installed and constructed before a certificate of occupancy is
issued for a new building or structure or before a vehicular use area is used
or occupied. No existing building, structure or vehicular use area adjoining a
Country Home District shall be expanded, altered or modified until the plans
are submitted by the owner or developer to the Planning Commission. The
Commission shall review such plans to determine if the changes adversely affect
any properties in the Country Home District. The Commission, after its review,
shall require, where necessary, the establishment of a landscape buffering area
or a revision of a previously established buffered area.
   (c)   Owners or developers of off-street parking areas shall be required to
include a plan for buffering the parking area. Such plan shall be submitted to
the Commission for approval. Such plan may be included as a part of the
development plot plan when a submission of a development plot plan is required.
   (d)   Existing boundaries requiring a buffer shall be identified by the
Inspector of Buildings and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 95-2-12. Passed 4-4-95.)
1266.06 PROCEDURES.
   (a)   When an application for a development plan is made, the Director of
Planning shall determine if the buffering requirement might be applicable. If
he or she determines that the request comes under the buffering requirement,
the Director shall so advise the applicant and shall submit a request to the
Planning Commission that the matter be reviewed once the applicant has
furnished the Commission with the following:
      (1)   A copy of the site plan;
      (2)   The topography of the building site and surrounding area; and
      (3)   A complete description of the area to be constructed or modified.
   (b)   The applicant shall provide the Commission with a detailed description
and sketch of the landscape buffer, prepared by a landscaping expert, which
visually and verbally outlines the nature and the effect of the proposed
landscape buffer.
   (c)   The Commission may request photographs or other descriptive data if
the Commission deems such data necessary.
   (d)   The Commission shall notify all owners immediately adjacent to the
property in question prior to any meeting at which the landscape buffering
requirement will appear on the agenda.
   (e)   A certificate of occupancy shall not be granted until buffering
requirements have been completed. If compliance is delayed because of the
growing season, a temporary permit to occupy may be granted by the Inspector of
Buildings. Such delay should not extend beyond the next growing season
following the date upon which the certificate of occupancy is requested.
   (f)   Where buffering is required, a building permit shall not be issued by
the Inspector of Buildings until an agreement has been reached between the
applicant and the Commission as to the buffering requirement. The agreement
between the Commission and the owner and/or developer shall include, among
other requirements, provisions for the following:
      (1)   Maintenance of the landscape buffer on the part of the applicant;
      (2)   Replacement procedures for any portion of the landscape buffer that
is for any reason no longer viable;
      (3)   Replacement of the landscape buffer involving plant material that
does not extend beyond the next growing season;
      (4)   Replacement of landscape material such as fences; and
      (5)   Replacement of landscape material within sixty days from the date
of notification by the Inspector of Buildings.

1270.06 MODIFICATIONS TO SCHEDULE.
   In industrial districts, wherever the application of the standards set forth
in Section

feet of building", the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals may permit the
construction of the lesser number of spaces, provided, however, that the
additional area required to provide the number of spaces under the "square feet
of building" standard shall be reserved and held as open area, along with all
required yard areas, for future construction of parking spaces until the use of
the building is changed to a classification having a greater number of
employees in relation to the building area.

1270.07 SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   A building containing one use shall provide off-street parking spaces

than the sum of the spaces required for each use.
   (b)   Institutions, as set forth in Section
1270.05, may assume that up to, but not more than, fifty percent of their
requirements may be shared in adjacent parking areas which are accessory to
business establishments and which normally have different hours of operation.
However, where there is a sharing of facilities by different owners, there
shall be a contract covering a period of time as may be required by the Board
and should any of the uses be changed or the facilities discontinued, then the
required spaces for the use remaining shall be provided elsewhere as a
condition precedent to the continued use of the building or buildings.

1460.01 REVIEW OF SITE PLAN BY ENGINEER.
   The site plan that is submitted to the Inspector of Buildings at the time an
application is made for a building permit for a main building shall be reviewed
by the Village Engineer to insure that the grade will be in conformity with the
topography of the adjacent land, allow proper drainage of surface water and
allow the construction of sewers at reasonable depths. Any changes to the site
plan suggested by the Engineer shall be made before a building permit is
issued.
(Ord. 73-5-8. Passed 5-16-73.)
1460.02 MINIMUM GRADE; FEE AND INSPECTION.
   Before proceeding beyond the foundation for a main building, the applicant
shall request a foundation check. The Village Engineer shall check the grade of
the foundation to determine whether it has been constructed in accordance with
the approved site plan. The Inspector of Buildings shall not permit the
continuation of construction until the grade of the foundation conforms to the
approved grade.
   Before applying for a Certificate of Occupancy, the applicant shall request
a grading check. The Village Engineer shall check the final grading and
drainage of the property. The Inspector of Buildings shall not issue a
Certificate of Occupancy until the final grading and drainage of the property
conforms to the approved site plan.
   The cost and expense of the review of the site plan and the grade checks
made by the Village Engineer shall be borne by the applicant. At the time of
submission of the site plan, the applicant shall prepay a fee with the Village
Treasurer of two hundred dollars ($200.00) in the case of a single-family home.
For a commercial and industrial building the applicant shall prepay three
hundred dollars ($300.00) for a parcel up to one acre and eighty dollars
($80.00) for each additional acre or fraction thereof in excess of one acre.
   If significant changes are made to the site plan or if reinspection of the
footer grade or final grading is necessary, an additional fee as determined by
the Village Engineer shall be required in order to defray the expense of such
re-review or reinspection; but the amount of such additional fee shall not be
in excess of the originally required fee.
   The cost and expense of such review and grade checks shall be deducted from
such prepaid fee. If such expenditures exceed such prepaid fee, the excess
shall, upon demand, be paid forthwith into the Municipal Treasury prior to the
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The Inspector of Buildings shall not
issue a Certificate of Occupancy until all Village fees have been paid.

with a controlled water supply over eighteen inches in depth or 200 square feet
in surface area and used or intended to be used publicly or privately for
swimming or recreative bathing, with or without the payment of a fee.
(Ord. 60-10-1. Passed 10-4-60.)
1462.02 CONSTRUCTION PERMIT AND APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   Before work is commenced on the construction of a swimming pool or any
alteration, addition, remodeling or other improvement thereto, an application
for a permit to construct, accompanied by the plans and specifications and
pertinent explanatory data hereafter required, shall be submitted to the
Inspector of Buildings for approval. No part of the work shall be commenced
until the Inspector has evidenced his approval by a suitable endorsement upon
such plans and specifications and has granted a permit therefor. Such
construction shall meet the requirements of this Building Code, including the
standards adopted in Title Four of this Part Fourteen - Building and Housing
Code, and the usual fees incidental thereto shall be paid for permits and
inspections.
(Ord. 60-10-1. Passed 10-4-60.)
1462.03 ENCLOSURES.
   Every outdoor swimming pool shall be completely surrounded by a fence, not
less than four feet in height or more than six feet in height, which shall be
constructed so that the horizontal members are on the pool side of the
enclosure and the vertical members are spaced not more than two inches apart.
The building or existing wall may be used as part of such enclosure.
   All gates or doors opening through such enclosure shall be designed to
permit locking and shall be kept locked when the pool is not in actual use or
is left unattended.
   The requirements for fencing and gates shall apply to both new and existing
outdoor swimming pools having a maximum depth over eighteen inches below ground
level. Such fence shall be installed prior to the placing of water in the
swimming pool. No person in possession of land within the Village, either as
owner, purchaser, lessee, tenant or licensee, upon which is situated a swimming
pool having a maximum depth over eighteen inches, shall fail to provide and
maintain such fence or wall as herein provided.
   The fence shall be located at least ten feet from the edge of the pool. No
pool shall be constructed, installed or erected in front of any building
setback line, nor shall it occupy an area greater than ten percent of the lot
area, nor be closer than ten feet to any lot side line or rear line.
(Ord. 87-9-5. Passed 11-3-87.)
1462.04 RECIRCULATION AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
   The water in the pool shall meet the requirements of the County Board of
Health. For new pools, provision shall be made for complete circulation of
water through all parts of the pool. The system shall be equipped with a water
recirculating system of sufficient capacity to provide a complete turnover of
water at least twice in each twenty-four hour period. Installation of new pools
of the fill and draw type shall not be permitted.
   A satisfactory recirculating system for the pool shall be installed,
consisting of circulating pumps, a fluid valve control on water supply, a hair
and lint catcher, piping connections to inlets and outlets and all other

1464.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall move, or cause to be moved, a building or other structure
in, along, upon or across any public street within the Village without first
obtaining a house moving permit from the Inspector of Buildings. No permit
shall be issued to any person until the applicant has complied with the
following requirements:
   (a)   The owner of a lot in the Village, or his agent, shall file an
application for a house moving permit with the Inspector of Buildings and pay a
filing fee therefor as provided in Section
1426.06. The application shall be on a form prescribed by or supplied by the
Inspector. After accepting the filing of the application, the Inspector shall
inspect the building or other structure desired to be moved to determine
whether it complies with this Building Code, except for anything that may be
disconnected, removed or secured preparatory to being moved. He shall also
determine that the building or structure is in first-class condition. Upon
determining that the building or structure complies with this Building Code and
is in first-class condition, the Inspector shall, subject to the other
requirements of this chapter, issue a tentative moving permit, dated that day
and which shall be valid for thirty days after that day. If the building or
structure is not moved within such period, the permit shall automatically
expire and there shall be no return of any portion of the filing fee. If the
building or structure is requested to be moved within such thirty-day period,
upon the day it is to be moved it shall be inspected by the Inspector prior to
being taken upon the public streets or highways to determine whether such
building or structure is in substantially the same condition as when first
inspected by him. If he determines that it is in substantially the same
condition as upon his first inspection, the building or structure shall then be
moved forthwith. If he determines that it is not in substantially the same
condition and is not in condition to be moved in or into the Village, then he
shall make a written statement to the applicant informing him of that fact and
the specific reasons for his finding and determination, whereupon the tentative
permit shall automatically terminate. The filing fee shall cover the cost of
the processing of the application and the two inspections of the building or
structure prior to its being moved. All other inspections and fees charged
therefor shall be done pursuant to other applicable sections of this Building
Code.
   (b)   The applicant must submit evidence of insurance, as approved by the
Solicitor, indemnifying the applicant and the Village in the sum of not less
than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for property damage and one hundred
thousand/three hundred thousand dollars ($100,000/300,000) for death or
personal injury.
   (c)   The applicant must submit a bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars
($10,000), satisfactory to the Solicitor, indemnifying the Village for any loss
or damage to streets or other public property.
   (d)   The applicant must post a cash bond with the Inspector in an amount
determined by the Inspector to cover the actual cost to the Village for the
removal of fire alarm wires, traffic lights and street lights, and the cost of
tree trimming, police protection and other expenses incurred by the Village in
connection with the moving of the structure.
   (e)   The applicant must submit a letter signed by an official of any
adjoining city or village into which the structure is to move to the effect
that such city or village will permit the movement of the structure onto the
streets of such adjoining city or village.
1464.02 APPROVAL OF POLICE CHIEF; SUPERVISION.
   Before the Inspector of Buildings issues any house moving permit, he shall
first secure the approval of the Chief of Police relative to any traffic
control problems and to clearances and gross weight of the structure on the
streets. The moving of any such building or structure shall be subject to the
supervision and direction of the Chief of Police and the Inspector of Buildings
during the occupancy of a public street by such building or structure.
(1965 Code §1347.02)
1464.03 CONFORMITY TO ZONING CODE.
   The Inspector of Buildings shall not issue a house moving permit unless it
is first determined by the Planning Commission that the proposed location of
the building or structure, if within the Village, conforms to the Zoning Code
and other pertinent regulations of the Village.

1476.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of the Village to:
   (a)   Establish predetermined districts or zones of the number and shape and
in the location considered best for the establishment of wireless communication
facilities as special land uses, subject to conformance with applicable
standards.
   (b)   Recognize that reasonable operation of a wireless communication system
may require the establishment of a facility in a location which is not within
one of the predetermined districts or zones. In such case, it has been
determined that there will be greater adverse impact upon the neighborhood and/
or area, and, consequently, more stringent standards and conditions should
apply to the review, approval and use of such a facility.
   (c)   Ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in
appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses, structures and
buildings, and to limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of
land use activities and adverse impact upon existing population, transportation
systems and other public services and facility needs by regulating and limiting
the establishment, placement and manner of wireless communication facilities.
   (d)   Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless
communication facilities.
   (e)   Promote the public health, safety and welfare.
   (f)   Provide for adequate public information about private plans for
wireless communication facilities, and allow the Village to efficiently plan
for the location of such facilities.
   (g)   Minimize the adverse impact of technological obsolescence of such
facilities, including the timely removal of facilities.
   (h)   Minimize the adverse impact from the presence of relatively tall
towers having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons,
recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material
impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values, and further
recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public
health, safety and welfare.
   (i)   Minimize the negative visual impact of wireless communication
facilities on neighborhoods, community landmarks, historic sites and buildings,
natural beauty areas and public rights-of-way. This contemplates the use of as
few structures as is reasonably feasible, and the use of structures which are
designed for compatibility, including the avoidance of lattice structures that
are unnecessary, taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this
section.
(Ord. 97-1-8. Passed 2-4-97.)
1476.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Collocation" means the location by two or more wireless
communications providers, a public authority or other duly authorized party, of
wireless communications facilities on an existing structure, tower or building,
in a manner that reduces the overall need for additional or multiple
freestanding single-use wireless communications facilities within the Village
of Valley View.
   (b)   "Support structure" means a structure newly erected or modified to
support wireless communication antennas and connecting appurtenances. Support
structure types include, but are not limited to, monopoles, lattice towers,
light poles, utility support structures, traffic control structures, wood poles
and guyed towers, or other structures which appear to be something other than
mere support structures.
   (c)   "Wireless communication facilities" means all structures and accessory
facilities relating to the use of the radio frequency spectrum for the purpose
of transmitting or receiving radio signals. Wireless communication facilities
may include, but are not limited to, radio towers, television towers, telephone
devices and exchanges, microwave relay towers, telephone transmission equipment
buildings and commercial mobile radio service facilities. Citizen band radio
facilities, short wave facilities, ham amateur radio facilities, satellite
dishes and governmental facilities which are subject to State or Federal law or
regulations which preempt municipal regulatory authority are not included in
this definition.
   (d)   "Wireless communication facility, attached" means a wireless communica
tion facility that is affixed to an existing structure, for example, an
existing building, tower, water tank, utility pole, etc., which does not
include an additional wireless communication support structure.

   (a)   Wireless communication facilities shall not be demonstrably injurious
to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public safety and welfare.
   (b)   The applicant shall demonstrate the need for the proposed facility to
be located as proposed based upon the presence of one or more of the following
factors:
      (1)   Proximity to an interstate or major thoroughfare.
      (2)   Areas of population concentration.
      (3)   Concentration of commercial, industrial and/or other business
centers.
      (4)   Areas where signal interference has occurred due to tall buildings,
masses of trees or other obstructions.
      (5)   Other specifically identified reasons creating a need for the
facility.
   (c)   The wireless communication facility shall be located and designed to
be harmonious with the surrounding area.
   (d)   All wireless communication facilities shall comply with applicable
Federal and State standards relative to electromagnetic impact.
   (e)   The applicant shall demonstrate a justification for the proposed
height of the structure and an evaluation of alternative designs which might
result in a lower height.
   (f)   The following additional standards shall be met:
      (1)   The maximum height of the support structure and antenna shall be
180 feet from grade level at the base. The accessory building contemplated to
enclose such items as switching equipment shall be limited to the maximum
height for accessory structures within the respective district.
      (2)   The setback of the support structure from any adjacent district
shall be at least the height of the highest point of any structure on the
premises. The setback of the support structure from any existing or proposed
right-of-way or other publicly traveled road shall be no less than the height
of the structure. The distance from an existing tower shall be no less than
2,000 feet.
      (3)   There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure, which
access may be provided through an easement. This access is necessary for the
maintenance of the facility and will have a width and location determined by
such factors as the location of adjacent thoroughfares and traffic and
circulation within the site; utilities needed to service the tower and any
attendant facilities; the location of buildings and parking facilities;
proximity to residential districts; minimizing disturbance to the natural
landscape; and the type of equipment which will be needed to access the site.
      (4)   The division of property for the purpose of locating a wireless
communication facility is prohibited unless all zoning requirements and
conditions are met.
      (5)   Where an attached wireless communication facility is proposed on
the roof of a building, the equipment enclosure shall not be permitted as a
roof appliance or penthouse on the building. The equipment enclosure may be
located within the principal building or may be an accessory building, provided
that, as an accessory building, it shall conform with all district requirements
for principal buildings, including yard setbacks.
      (6)   The Planning Commission shall, with respect to the color of the
support structure and all accessory buildings, review and approve the same so
as to minimize distractions, reduce visibility, maximize aesthetic appearance
and ensure compatibility with surrounding structures. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to maintain the wireless communication facility
in a neat and orderly condition.
      (7)   The support system shall be constructed in accordance with all
applicable building codes and shall include the submission of a soils report
from a geotechnical engineer licensed in the State of Ohio. This soils report
shall include soil borings and statements indicating the suitability of soil
conditions for the proposed use. The requirements of the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Federal Communication Commission and the Ohio Aeronautics
Commission shall be noted.
      (8)   A maintenance plan, and any applicable maintenance agreement, shall
be presented and approved as part of the site plan for the proposed facility.

   (d)   The application shall include a description of the security to be
posted at the time of receiving a building permit for the facility to ensure
removal of the facility when it has been abandoned or is no longer needed, as
provided in Section
1476.08. In this regard, the security shall be in the form of cash, a surety
bond, a letter of credit or an agreement in a form approved by the Solicitor
for the Village establishing the land in question as security for removal.
   (e)   The application shall include a map showing the existing and known
proposed wireless communication facilities within the Village, and further
showing the existing and known proposed wireless communication facilities
within areas surrounding the borders of the Village in the location, and in the
area, which are relevant in terms of potential collocation or in demonstrating
the need for the proposed facility.
   (f)   The application shall include the name, address and telephone number
of the person to contact for engineering, maintenance and other notice
purposes. This information shall be continuously updated during all times the
facility is on the premises.
(Ord. 97-1-8. Passed 2-4-97.)
1476.06 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE DESIGNATED
AREAS.
   For facilities proposed to be located outside of a district or overlay zone
as identified in Section
1476.03, an application shall be reviewed and, if approved, such facilities
shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the following additional
standards and requirements, in addition to those set forth in Section
1476.04. Facilities to be constructed pursuant to this section shall be
required to obtain a variance as per ordinance and procedure.
   (a)   At the time of the submittal, the applicant shall demonstrate that the
location within the district or overlay zone cannot reasonably meet the
coverage and/or capacity needs of the applicant.
   (b)   Wireless communication facilities shall be of a design such as a
steeple, bell tower or other form which is compatible with the existing
character of the proposed site, neighborhood and general area, as approved by
the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Site locations outside of a district or overlay zone, as identified in
Section
1476.03, shall be permitted on a priority basis on the following sites, subject
to the application of all other standards contained in this section:
      (1)   A municipally-owned site.
      (2)   Another governmentally-owned site.
      (3)   A religious or other institutional site.
      (4)   A public park and other large permanent open space areas, when
compatible.
      (5)   A public or private school site.
   (d)   No sites are permitted in an area designated as County homes, except
for those sites identified in Zoning Map II.
(Ord. 97-1-8. Passed 2-4-97.)
1476.07 COLLOCATION.
   (a)   Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the Village to minimize the
overall number of attached wireless communication facilities and wireless
communication support structures within the community, consistent with the
statement of purpose and intent set forth in Section
1476.01. Each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must, by
law, be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the
objectives promulgated by the United States Congress. However, particularly in
light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication
facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the recent change of
Federal law and policy in and relating to the Federal Telecommunications Act of
1996, it is the policy of the Village that all users should collocate on
attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support
structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this
section, as stated above, and as stated in Section
1476.01. If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility
owned or otherwise controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result
will be the need for a new and unnecessary additional structure which is in
direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy, intent and
purpose of the Village. The provisions of this subsection are designed to carry
out and encourage conformity with the policy of the Village.
   (b)   Feasibility of Collocation. Collocation shall be deemed to be feasible
for purposes of this section where all of the following are met:
      (1)   The provider entity being considered for collocation will undertake
to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation.
      (2)   The site on which collocation is being considered, including
reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide
structural support.
      (3)   The collocation being considered is technologically reasonable,
e.g., the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given
appropriate physical and other adjustment, in relation to the structure,
antennas and the like.
      (4)   The height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be
increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the Village, taking into
consideration the several standards contained in Section
1476.04 and
1476.06.
   (c)   Requirements for Collocation.
      (1)   A special land use permit for the construction and use of a new
wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the
applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the
coverage area and capacity needs.
      (2)   All new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be
designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation.
      (3)   If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication
facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a
proposed and otherwise feasible collocation, such facility shall thereupon and
thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be
altered, expanded or extended in any respect.
      (4)   If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication
facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation, and this
failure or refusal requires the construction and/or use of a new facility, the
party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to
be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and purposes of
the Village, and, consequently, such party shall be prohibited from receiving
approval for a new wireless communication support structure within the Village
for a period of five years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit
the collocation, unless such party shall seek and obtain a variance from the
Planning Commission upon proving that a new facility is clearly necessary in
order to operate the respective communication system, considering all feasible
alternatives.
   (d)   Incentive. Review of an application for collocation, and review of an
application for a permit for the use of an existing facility, shall be
expedited by the Village.
NOTE: A COMMUNITY MAY DETERMINE THAT REVIEW SHOULD MERELY REQUIRE SITE PLAN
REVIEW WHERE STRUCTURAL ALTERATION IS NOT NECESSARY, PARTICULARLY FOR
STRUCTURES ON WHICH COLLOCATION WAS PRE-APPROVED WHEN THE FACILITY WAS
INITIALLY ESTABLISHED.
(Ord. 97-1-8. Passed 2-4-97.)
1476.08 REMOVAL.
   (a)   A condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility
shall be the adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility by
users and owners upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
      (1)   When the facility has not been used for 180 days or more. For
purposes of this paragraph, the removal of antennas or other equipment from the
facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of
radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
      (2)   When six months has passed following the availability of new
technology, at reasonable cost, which new technology permits the operation of
the communication system without the requirement of the support structure.
   (b)   The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set
forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) hereof, may be applied and limited to
portions of a facility.
   (c)   Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal, as
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) hereof, the property owner or person who
had used the facility shall immediately apply, or secure the application, for
any required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and
complete the demolition/removal, restoring the site to the condition which
existed prior to the construction of the facility.
   (d)   If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not
been lawfully completed within sixty days of the applicable deadline, and after
at least thirty days written notice, the Village may remove or secure the
removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its actual cost and
reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected from the security
posted at the time application was made for establishing the facility.

excavations in streets for any facility needed for the maintenance or extension
of the permittee's system. Prior to doing such work, the permittee shall apply
for, and obtain, generally applicable permits from the Village, and give
appropriate notices to any other franchisees, licensees or permittees of the
Village, or departments of the Village, or other units of government owning or
maintaining pipes, wires, conduits or other facilities which may be affected by
the proposed excavation.
      (4)   In the event that emergency repairs are necessary, the permittee
shall immediately notify the Village of the need for such repairs. The
permittee may initiate such emergency repairs, and shall apply for appropriate
permits within twenty-four hours after discovery of the emergency. The
permittee shall comply with all applicable regulations of the Village relating
to such excavation or construction, including the payment of permit or license
fees.
   (b)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   Within forty-eight hours after any other franchisee, licensee,
permittee or other entity to which the Village has granted permission to
conduct excavation activities notifies a permittee of a proposed street
excavation, the permittee shall, at the permittee's expense:
         A.   Mark on the surface all of its locatable underground facilities
within the area of the proposed excavation;
         B.   Notify the excavator of any unlocatable underground facilities in
the area of the proposed excavation; or
         C.   Notify the excavator that the permittee does not have any
underground facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation.
      (2)   In the event that all surfaces were accurately marked for
underground facilities as requested and the permittee's plant was cut or
damaged for whatever reason, then the entity responsible for causing such
damage shall be required to notify the permittee of such damage and pay for the
repair of the permittee's plant.
   (c)   Restoration of Streets.
      (1)   Whenever a permittee disturbs the surface of any street for any
purpose, the permittee shall promptly restore the street to at least its prior
condition, to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. When any opening is
made by a permittee in a hard surface pavement in any street, the permittee
shall promptly refill the opening and restore the surface to a condition
satisfactory to the Village Engineer.
      (2)   If the permittee excavates the surface of any street, the permittee
shall be responsible for restoration of the street and its surface within the
area affected by the excavation, in accordance with applicable regulations of
the Village and to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. The Village may,
after providing notice and an opportunity to correct to the permittee, refill
and/or repave any opening made by the permittee in the street, and the expense
thereof shall be paid by the permittee. The Village may, after providing notice
and an opportunity to correct to the permittee, remove and/or repair any work
done by the permittee which, in the determination of the Village, is
inadequate. The cost thereof, including the costs of inspection and
supervision, shall be paid by the permittee. All excavations made by the
permittee in the streets shall be properly safeguarded for the prevention of
accidents. All of the permittee's work under this chapter and this section, in
particular, shall be done in strict compliance with all rules, regulations and
ordinances of the Village.
   (d)   Maintenance and Workmanship.
      (1)   A permittee's system shall be constructed and maintained in such a
manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of
the Village or County, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals,
structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the streets by, or
under, the authority of the Village.
      (2)   The permittee shall provide and use any equipment and appliances
necessary to control and carry the permittee's signals or other utilities so as
to prevent injury to the Village's property or property belonging to any
person. The permittee, at its own expense, shall repair, renew, change and
improve its facilities as listed above in good repair, and safe and presentable
condition.
   (e)   Acquisition of Facilities. Upon a permittee's acquisition of
facilities in any street in the Village, or upon the addition or annexation to
the Village of any area in which the permittee owns or operates any facility,
the permittee shall, at the Village's request, submit to the Village a
statement describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by franchise,
permit, license or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such
facilities to the extent the permittee has possession of such information. Such
facilities shall immediately be subject to the terms of this chapter.
   (f)   Reservation of Village Street Rights. Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent the Village, or public utilities owned, maintained and/or operated by
public entities other than the Village, from constructing sewers; grading,
paving, repairing and/or altering any street; laying down, repairing or
removing water mains; or constructing or establishing any other public work or
improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, so as not to
obstruct, injure, or prevent the use and operation of the permittee's system.
However, if any of the permittee's system interferes with the construction or
repair of any street or public improvement, including construction, repair or
removal of a sewer or water main, such portion of the permittee's system shall
be removed or replaced in the manner the Village shall reasonably direct, and
the Village shall in no event be liable for any damage to any portion of the
permittee's system. Any and all such removal or replacement shall be at the
expense of the permittee. Should the permittee fail to remove, adjust or
relocate its facilities by the date established in the written notice of the
Village to the permittee, the Village may effect such removal, adjustment or
relocation, and the reasonable expense thereof shall be paid by the permittee,
including all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Village due to the
permittee's delay.
   (g)   Street Vacation. If any street or portion thereof used by the
permittee is vacated by the Village during the term of its permit, unless the
Village specifically reserves to the permittee the right to continue its
installation in the vacated street, the permittee shall, without delay or
expense to the Village, remove or discontinue its use of its facilities from
such street, and restore, repair or reconstruct the street where such removal
has occurred, and replace the street in the condition found. In the event of
the failure, neglect or refusal of the permittee, after a time period to be
negotiated by the Village and the permittee, to restore, repair or reconstruct
such street, the Village may do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost
may be collected by the Village from the performance bond of the permittee, if
applicable.
   (h)   Discontinuing Use of Facilities. Whenever a permittee intends to
discontinue using any facility within the streets, the permittee shall submit
for the Village's approval a complete description of the facility and the date
on which the permittee intends to discontinue using the facility. The permittee
may remove the facility or request that the Village permit it to remain in
place. Notwithstanding the permittee's request that any such facility remain in
place, the Village may require the permittee to remove the facility from above
the street or modify the facility to protect the public health, welfare, safety
and convenience, or otherwise serve the public interest. The Village may
require the permittee to perform a combination of modification and removal of
any such above-ground facility. The permittee shall complete such removal or
modification in accordance with a schedule set by the Village and shall restore
the area to a condition satisfactory to the Village. Until such time as the
permittee removes or modifies the facility as directed by the Village, or until
the rights to and responsibility for the facility are accepted by another
person having authority to construct and maintain such facility, the permittee
shall be responsible for all necessary repairs and relocations of the facility,
as well as maintenance of the street, in the same manner and degree as if the
facility were in active use, and the permittee shall retain all liability for
such facility.
   (i)   Hazardous Substances.

streets. Upon reasonable notice to the permittee, the Village may inspect the
permittee's facilities in the streets to determine if any release of hazardous
substances has occurred, or may occur, from or related to the permittee's
system. In removing or modifying the permittee's facilities as provided in this
chapter, the permittee shall also remove all residue of hazardous substances
related thereto.
      (3)   The permittee shall agree to forever indemnify the Village against
any claims, costs and expenses, of any kind, nature and description, whether
direct or indirect, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the Village
arising out of the release of hazardous substances caused by the permittee's
system.
   (j)   Undergrounding of Cable. A permittee's existing facilities and
portions of the permittee's system shall be placed underground at the
permittee's expense when other utilities in the same rights-of way place their
facilities underground, or when required of all utilities and persons by
general ordinances of the Village or applicable State or Federal law.
   (k)   Construction Codes. A permittee shall strictly adhere to all building
and zoning codes currently or hereafter in effect. The permittee shall arrange

repeaters, underground lines, vaults, manholes, handholes, wires, cables,
towers, poles and attachments and other appurtenances, on both public and
private property, in such a manner as to cause no unreasonable interference
with the use of such public or private property by any person. In the event of
such interference, the Village may require the removal or relocation of the
permittee's facilities, at the permittee's sole cost and expense, and other
appurtenances from the property in question.
   (l)   Construction and use of Poles.
      (1)   Whenever feasible, the construction, maintenance and use of the
permittee's system shall comply with the standards of materials in engineering
and all other provisions of a pole user agreement for use of poles, entered
into by and between other pole users and the permittee. In the event the
permittee cannot obtain the necessary poles and allied facilities pursuant to
the provisions of such an agreement, and only in such event, then it shall be
lawful for the permittee to make all needed excavations in the streets for the
purpose of placing, erecting, laying, maintaining, repairing and removing
poles, conduits, supports for wires and conductors, and any other facility
needed for the maintenance or extension of the permittee's system as the
Village may, at its discretion, approve. All poles of the permittee shall be
erected between the curb and the sidewalk unless otherwise designated by the
proper authorities of the Village, and each pole shall be set whenever
practicable at an extension lot line. The Village shall have the right to
require the permittee to change the location of any permittee-owned pole,
conduit, structure or other facility within the streets when, in the opinion of
the Village, the public convenience requires such change, and the expense
thereof shall be paid by the permittee.
      (2)   Nothing herein shall exempt the permittee from compliance with all

liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
interfering with the permittee's system facilities while performing the public
works.
      (2)   If any equipment of the permittee shall interfere with public
works, then, upon receipt of the notice, that part of the equipment of the
permittee which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the permittee in
such manner as shall be directed by the Village so that the same shall not
interfere with the public works as reasonably determined by the Village, and
the permittee shall bear the reasonable expense of such removal or replacement.
   (cc)   Notice. Except in the case of an emergency involving public safety or
service interruption to a large number of subscribers, the permittee shall give
reasonable notice to the property owners or legal tenants prior to entering
upon any private premises, and said notice shall specify the work to be

      (2)   Except in emergencies, the permittee may not prune trees at a point
below thirty feet above sidewalk grade until one week after written notice has
been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the street in or
over which the tree is growing. For purposes of this subsection, emergencies
exist when it is necessary to prune to protect the public from imminent danger
of immediate interruption of cable signal. The owner or occupant shall have
seven days from the receipt of the permittee's notice to arrange for an outside
contractor to prune the tree, at his or her own expense. If the owner or
occupant fails to do so, the permittee may prune such tree at its own expense.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.06 ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATION.
   (a)   Authority. The Village expressly reserves, and the permittee expressly
recognizes, the Village's right and duty to adopt, from time to time, in
addition to the provisions herein contained, such Charter provisions,
resolutions, ordinances and rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary by
the Village in the lawful exercise of its police power for the protection of
the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and their properties. The
Charter and these Codified Ordinances, as the same may be amended from time to
time, are expressly incorporated, as if fully set out herein, by this
reference. The permittee shall comply with all Charter provisions, resolutions,
ordinances, rules and regulations of the Village and shall obtain all required
permits. All permittees who are also franchisees under a cable television
franchise granted by the Village shall further comply with all requirements
contained in the cable franchise agreement and the master cable television
regulatory ordinance. Any failure of the permittee to comply with the
requirements of the Village described herein shall constitute an evasion of
obligations under this chapter, and shall be prohibited. The Village reserves
the right to delegate any of its right or obligations under this chapter,
without the consent of the permittee, to any person, organization or official.
   (b)   Coordination and Environmental Impact. Except for emergencies, the
Village may require that all construction and installations be coordinated with
the Village's street improvement programs. In addition, the permittee shall
assess and report on the impact of its proposed construction on the Village
environment. Such reports may be reviewed by the Village to ensure, inter alia,
(i) that all applicable laws, including building and zoning codes and air and
water pollution regulations, are complied with; (ii) that aesthetic and good
planning principles have been given due consideration; and (iii) that adverse
impact on the environment has been minimized. The permittee shall incorporate
reasonable changes requested by the Village.
   (c)   Construction and Restoration. All streets, public property, and
lawfully installed improvements therein which are disturbed by the permittee's
activity shall be restored to the Village's satisfaction in the time frame
prescribed by the Village, or if not prescribed by the Village, as soon as
possible, but in no circumstances more than thirty days from the date of
completion of construction, by the permittee, at its expense, to, at a minimum,
the condition which existed prior to construction, to the Village's
satisfaction. In the event replacement and restoration of the area is not
completed within thirty days or as soon as reasonably possible, the Village
may, upon written notice to the permittee, complete any necessary work at the
sole expense of the permittee.
   (d)   Undergrounding. Except where noted in the Exhibits attached to
original Ordinance 98-10-11, passed October 14, 1998, and specifically
authorized by the Village prior to construction, all of the permittee's
facilities shall be installed underground and all installation of street
crossings shall be made by boring. The permittee shall make no open cuts
without specific prior written permission of the Village Engineer or his or her
designee. Additionally, any facilities not installed underground must be
expressly authorized beforehand by the Village in writing, and so located that
any interference with the other uses of the streets and other public
properties, and any interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners whose property adjoins any of the streets and other public
properties, are minimal. No underground installation shall be made in any
public right-of-way without having first obtained a street cut or other permit
from the Village and complying with the Village's bonding requirements.
   (e)   Alternative Burial Standards. In cases where the burial standards of
Section
1478.05(x) do not apply, the minimum burial depth for the permittee's
underground facilities shall be two feet, or such other depth as approved by
the Village, with warning tape buried above all fiber optic cable, conduit or
lines to reduce the potential for accidental breakage and to minimize actions
under the hold harmless provisions of Section
1478.08(a).
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.07 REPORTS AND RECORDS.
    (a)   Open Records. The permittee shall manage all of its operations in
accordance with a policy of keeping its records open and accessible to the
Village. The Village shall have access to, and the right to inspect at all
reasonable times, any books and records of the permittee and affiliated
entities which are reasonably related to the administration or enforcement of
the terms of this chapter. The permittee shall not deny the Village access to
any of the permittee's records on the basis that the permittee's records are
under the control of any parent company, affiliated entity or a third party.
The Village may also, in writing, request copies of any such records or books
and the permittee shall provide such copies within thirty days of the
transmittal of such request, at the sole expense of the permittee. If the
requested books and records are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot
be copied or removed, then the permittee may request, in writing, within ten
days, that the Village inspect them at the permittee's local offices. If any
books or records of the permittee are not kept in a local metropolitan office
and copies are not made available to the Village upon written request as set
forth above, and if the Village determines that an examination of such records
is necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of the Village's duties,
including audits or the administration or enforcement of this chapter, then all
reasonable travel and maintenance expense(s) incurred in making such
examination shall be paid by the permittee. The requirements of this section
shall be in addition to any other similar sections contained in other
ordinances that affect the permittee.
   (b)   Confidentiality. The Village agrees to treat as confidential any books
or records that constitute proprietary or confidential information under
Federal or State law to the extent the permittee makes the Village aware of
such confidentiality. The permittee shall be responsible for clearly and
conspicuously stamping the word "Confidential" on each page that contains
confidential or proprietary information, and shall provide a written
explanation why such information should be treated as confidential under State
or Federal law. If the Village receives a demand from any person for disclosure
of any information designated by the permittee as confidential, the Village
shall, so far as consistent with applicable law, advise the permittee and
provide the permittee with a copy of any written request by the party demanding
access to such information within a reasonable time. Nothing herein contained
shall alter the Village's obligation to comply with the Ohio Open Records Act
as the same may, from time to time, be amended.
   (c)   Public Filings.
      (1)   The permittee shall notify the Mayor of the Village, and provide a
copy, upon its request, of all FCC, Federal and State reports and filings on
behalf of the permittee or its affiliates which relate to the operation of the
system.
      (2)   All information furnished to the Village that is not subject to
confidential treatment under subsection (b) hereof is public information, and
shall be treated as such.
   (d)   Annual Reports. Within 120 days after the close of the permittee's
fiscal year, the permittee shall submit to the Village a written annual report,
in a form acceptable to the Village, which shall include, but not necessarily
be limited to, the following information for the permit area:
      (1)   An expense statement certified by an officer of the permittee;
      (2)   A summary of the previous year's activities in development of the
system, including, but not limited to, services begun or discontinued during
the reporting year, and the number of users of the permittee's services;
      (3)   A statement of planned construction, if any, for the next two
years;
      (4)   A list of the permittee's officers, members of its Board of
Directors, and other principals of the permittee; and
      (5)   A list of stockholders, or other equity investors holding five
percent or more of the voting interest in the permittee and its parent,
subsidiary and affiliated corporations and other entities, if any, unless the
parent is a public corporation whose annual reports are publicly available, in
which case a copy of the annual report shall be submitted.
   (e)   Plant Survey Report. At the Village's request, including, but not
limited to, requests based on customer complaints or the Village's own
experience with the facilities, the permittee shall submit to the Village,
within thirty days of the request, unless such time is extended by the Village,
a plant survey report, which shall be a survey of the permittee's plant within
all or portions of the permit area as specified by the Village, and a full
report thereon. Said report shall include, but not be limited to, an
appropriate engineering evaluation of the telecommunications and/or utility
system, including, but not limited to, any suitable electronic measurements
conducted in conformity with such requirements, including supervision, as the
Village may prescribe. Said report shall be in sufficient detail to enable the
Village to ascertain that the same meet service requirements and all applicable
Federal, State and local construction, operational and technical performance
standards. At the Village's request, but not more than once per year, the
permittee and the Village shall agree upon the appointment of a qualified
independent engineer to evaluate and verify the performance of the system.
Subject to prior appropriation of funds therefor, the cost of the evaluation
shall be borne equally by the permittee and the Village, unless the independent
engineer determines that the system fails to meet applicable standards, in
which case the permittee shall reimburse the Village for all costs of the
evaluation.
   (f)   Failure to Report. The failure or neglect of the permittee to file any
of the reports or filings required under this chapter, or such other reports as
the Village may reasonably request, may, at the Village's option, be deemed a
breach of this chapter.
   (g)   False Statements. Any intentional false or misleading statement or
representation in any report required by this chapter may be deemed a breach of
this chapter and may subject the permittee to all remedies, legal or equitable,
which are available to the Village under this chapter or otherwise.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.08 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
   (a)   Indemnification.
      (1)   The permittee shall construct, maintain and operate its facilities
in a manner which provides protection against injury or damage to persons or
property. The permittee, for itself and its related entities, agents, employees
and subcontractors, and the agents and employees of said subcontractors, shall
hold the Village harmless, defend and indemnify the Village, its successors,
assigns, officers, employees, agents and appointed and elected officials, from
and against all liability or damage and all claims or demands whatsoever in
nature and reimburse the Village for all its reasonable expenses, including
attorney fees, as incurred, arising out of the installation and operation of
the permittee's system within the streets and rights-of-way, including, but not
limited to, the actions of the permittee, its employees, agents, contractors,
related entities, successors and assigns, or the securing of and the exercise
by the permittee of the permit rights granted in this chapter, including any
third party claims, administrative hearings, actions for copyright infringement
and litigation, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this chapter. The terms of each contract awarded by
the permittee for activities pursuant to this chapter shall contain indemnity
provisions whereby the contractor shall indemnify the Village to the same
extent as described above.
      (2)   The permittee shall pay, and by its acceptance of the provisions of
this chapter and any permit issued hereunder, agrees to pay, all actual
expenses incurred by the Village in defending itself with regard to all damage
and penalties arising in any way out of the exercise of any rights granted
hereunder. In the event the Village institutes litigation against the permittee
for a breach of the provisions of this chapter or a permit issued hereunder or
for an interpretation of this chapter, and the Village is the prevailing party,
the permittee shall reimburse the Village for all costs related thereto,
including reasonable attorney fees.
   (b)   Notice. Within thirty days after receipt of the same by the Solicitor,
the Village will provide notice to the permittee of the assertation of any
claim or action arising out of the exercise by the permittee of its permit
rights. The permittee will be permitted, at its own expense, to appear and
defend or assist in the defense of such claims. The permittee shall have no
recourse whatsoever against the Village for or on account of any loss, cost,
expense or damage arising out of the provisions or requirements of this
chapter, or the grant of the permit.
   (c)   Certificate of Insurance.
      (1)   At the time of the execution of a permit issued hereunder, and
annually thereafter, the permittee shall provide to the Village, in accordance
with the provisions hereof, a certificate of insurance. The permittee shall
maintain public liability and property damage insurance that protects the
permittee and the Village, its officers, agents, employees and appointed and
elected officials, from any and all claims for damages or personal injury,
including death, and demands, actions and suits brought against any of them
arising from operations under this chapter or in connection with a permit
issued hereunder, in accordance with the subsections below. Coverage during
construction shall include those hazards normally identified as X.C.U. This
insurance coverage constitutes a minimum requirement and shall in no way be
deemed to lessen or limit the liability of the permittee, related entities, its
successors or assigns, under the terms of a revocable permit issued hereunder.
      (2)   The certificate of insurance shall be with a company licensed to do
business in the State of Ohio with a rating by Best of not less than "A". This
liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection
against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property
resulting from the permittee's automobiles, products and operations. The
insurance shall provide coverage at all times for not less than five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) for bodily injury to any one person and one million
dollars ($1,000,000) for property damage in the aggregate per single accident
or occurrence, plus costs of defense, or in such other amounts as are
acceptable to the Village and as provide substantially equivalent coverage. The
following endorsements shall attach to the liability policy:
         A.   The policy shall cover personal injury as well as bodily injury.
         B.   The policy shall cover blanket contractual liability, subject to
the standard universal exclusions of contractual liability included in the
carrier's standard endorsement as to bodily injuries, personal injuries and
property damage.
         C.   Broad form property damage liability shall be afforded.
         D.   The Village and its elected officials, officers, agents and
employees shall be named as additional insureds on the policy. Notwithstanding
the naming of additional insureds, the insurance shall protect each insured in
the same manner as though a separate policy had been issued to each, but
nothing herein shall operate to increase the insurer's liability as set forth
elsewhere in the policy beyond the amount or amounts for which the insurer
would have been liable if only one person or interest had been named as
insured. The coverage must apply as to claims between insureds on the policy.
         E.   Standard form of cross-liability shall be afforded.
         F.   The policy shall not be canceled or materially altered so as to
be out of compliance with the requirements of this section without thirty days
written notice of such cancellation given to the Village.
      (3)   If the insurance is canceled or materially altered so as to be out
of compliance with the requirements of this section, the permittee shall
provide a replacement policy. The permittee shall agree to maintain continuous
uninterrupted insurance coverage in the amounts required.
      (4)   The Village reserves the right to adjust the coverage limit
requirement upward in the event the statutory maximums applicable to local
governments are raised and that such increased coverage limit requirements are
equally applied to all other permittees of the Village.
      (5)   Any deductible or self-insured retention must be declared to the
Village.
      (6)   The permittee shall submit to and maintain on file with the Village
documentation of the required insurance, including a certificate of insurance
signed by the insurance agent and the companies named, as well as all properly
executed endorsements. Said certificate shall be subject to the approval of the
Village as to the adequacy of the certificate and of the insurance certified
under the requirements of this section.
      (7)   Failure of the permittee to maintain adequate insurance as required
under this section shall be cause for immediate termination of the permit by
the Village.
      (8)   Nothing herein contained shall be in any way construed as a waiver
on behalf of the Village or any of the protections or provisions of the Ohio
Governmental Immunity Act, and the permittee shall ensure that in naming the
Village as an insured under this section, all insurance policies or agreements
shall specifically contain a non-waiver provision and shall not impair said
protection and provisions.
   (d)   Security.
      (1)   With respect to the initial construction of the telecommunications
and/or other utility system, or any significant project to upgrade or rebuild
more than fifty percent of the telecommunications and/or other utility system,
the permittee shall provide to the Village a construction performance and
construction completion bond (hereinafter referred to as the construction
completion bond), with a surety reasonably approved by the Village's Solicitor,
in an amount equal to ten percent of the applicable estimated construction
cost. Such amount shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000).
With respect to the initial construction of the telecommunications and/or other
utility system or the upgrade or rebuild project, when regular subscriber
service is available to seventy-five percent of occupied dwelling units, the
amount of the bond shall be reduced by fifty percent of the original amount. On
the one-year anniversary of the initial construction of the telecommunications
and/or other utility system or the upgrade or rebuild project, as the case may
be, the bond may be canceled.
      (2)   The permittee shall also deposit with the Village a surety bond or
letter of credit in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Village's Solicitor (hereinafter referred to as
the performance bond). The performance bond shall be available to insure the
faithful performance by the permittee of provisions of the permit, other than
with respect to construction, upgrading or rebuilding projects covered herein.
The performance bond shall be maintained at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)
during the entire term of the permit, regardless of withdrawals which may be
made under this section. In the event of a default by the permittee in any of
its obligations under this chapter, other than completion of construction,
which default is not cured within thirty days after notice by the Village to
the permittee of such default (or such longer time as is necessary to cure, so
long as the permittee commences to cure within thirty days and diligently
pursues such cure), the Village may levy on the performance bond upon notifying
the permittee of the amount of such charge. The rights reserved to the Village
with respect to the performance bond are in addition to all other rights of the
Village, at law or in equity.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98; Ord. 2020-10-10. Passed 12-1-20.)
1478.09 REMOVAL OF FACILITIES; TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TO VILLAGE
   Upon revocation of a permit, and no proposed assignee requests and receives
the Village's approval of a transfer of the permittee's telecommunications and/
or other utility system, and an assignment of such permit or grant of a new
permit, within a reasonable period of time, but in no event more than ninety
days after such termination, then the permittee shall remove said
telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities at the permittee's
expense. As an alternative to removal, the permittee may, subject to the
Village's approval, abandon its facilities in place and transfer ownership of
the installed telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities to the
Village. Nothing herein contained shall cause the Village to incur any costs
related to the removal of the permittee's facilities or the transfer of
ownership of said facilities to the Village.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.10 ASSIGNMENT OF PERMIT AND LEASE OF FACILITIES.
    (a)   Village's Consent Required for Assignment. The permittee shall not
assign a permit or any rights or obligations accorded the permittee hereunder
to any party without the prior written consent of the Village, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Further, the permittee agrees not to assign
any billing or collection functions under a permit to a subsidiary or parent
without prior written notice to and written consent from the Village, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should the permittee attempt to
assign its permit or its rights hereunder without the prior consent of the
Village, such permit shall be subject to forfeiture or termination as provided
herein, unless such assignment is ratified by the Village for any and all costs
incurred, including attorney fees, resulting from any such attempt to assign
such permit, in whole or part. A refusal by the Village to approve the
assignment of a permit or the permittee's rights hereunder as it relates to any
requirement or condition of the Village that the proposed assignee cure any
existing default of the permittee hereunder and/or to any demonstration of the
assignee's qualifications equivalent to demonstrations of the permittee's
qualifications required hereunder, including, but not limited to, the technical
and financial strength and operating experience of the assignee.
   (b)   Lessee to Obtain Permit. The permittee shall not lease any of its
telecommunications and/or utilities facilities, system capacity, system
bandwidth or use of the streets and rights-of-way in which such are contained,
to any persons or other entities providing telecommunications and/or other
utility services without first ensuring that such persons or other entities
have obtained a revocable permit and other required permits or franchises from
the Village for the provision of such services, and without the prior written
consent of the Village.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.11 PERMIT REVOCATION.
   (a)   Permit Revocable. A permit granted hereunder shall be revocable at any
time that Council shall determine that the public convenience and necessity or
the public health, safety or general welfare requires such revocation or where
the permittee has breached any of the provisions of this chapter or its permit,
and the right to revoke the same is hereby expressly reserved to the Village.
However, at a reasonable time prior to Council action upon such revocation or
proposed revocation, opportunity shall be afforded to the permittee, its
successors and assigns, to be present at a hearing to be conducted by Council
upon such matters and thereafter to present its or their views and opinions
thereof and to present for consideration actions alternative to the revocation
of a permit.
   (b)   Continued Obligations. The revocation of a permit, for any reason,
shall not operate as a waiver or release of the permittee from any obligation
or any liability which arose or arises out of any act or failure to act
required under such permit prior to termination.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.12 EQUAL OPPORTUNITY; SAFETY.
    (a)   Nondiscrimination. In all matters connected with this chapter, the
permittee shall not discriminate against any employee, subcontractor, customer,
client or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, age, sex,
national origin, or handicap. The permittee shall adhere to acceptable
affirmative action guidelines in selecting employees, subcontractors and
customers and shall ensure that the employees, subcontractors, and customers
are treated in all respects without regard to their race, color, religion, age,
sex or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the
following: employment, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, recruitment
and recruitment hiring, layoffs, termination, rates of pay or other forms of
compensation, and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The
permittee agrees to comply with such applicable rules, regulations or
guidelines as the Village, the State or Federal agencies may issue to implement
these requirements.
   (b)   Safe Work Place. It is a condition of a permit issued hereunder that
the permittee shall not, in all matters connected with the permit, require any
person employed or subcontracting in the performance of such permit to work in
surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or
dangerous to health or safety. The permittee shall comply with all applicable
safety rules and regulations adopted by the United States Department of Labor,
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Industrial
Commission of Ohio, or the Village, whichever is more restrictive.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.13 COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS.
    The permittee's telecommunications and/or other utilities system shall be
constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with all applicable Federal,
State and local standards and requirements. If the Village, or a qualified
independent engineer of the Village's choosing, determines at any time that the
permittee's system is not in compliance with applicable standards or
requirements and so notifies the permittee, then the permittee shall
immediately take appropriate remedial action and continue such action without
interruption, until the system is in compliance.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.14 EMERGENCY USE OF FACILITIES.
   The permittee shall, in the case of any Village, State or national emergency
or disaster, upon the request of the Mayor, Council or any designated
representative thereof, make its facilities available to the Village, without
cost, for emergency use during the duration of the emergency or disaster
period.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)

Village may possess arising from any alleged violation of this chapter, and the
Village reserves all rights available to it under current or future laws.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.16 COMPLIANCE WITH CHAPTER REQUIRED.

of this chapter by any failure of the Village to insist upon or to seek
compliance with such provisions.
(Ord. 98-10-11. Passed 10-14-98.)
1478.17 PERMITTEE AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.
    Except as otherwise provided by Section
1478.10, this chapter governs rights between the Village and the permittee, and
is not intended in any way to confer any rights, duties or obligations upon any
third parties. The permittee shall conduct the work to be performed pursuant to
this chapter as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the Village.

1492.01 FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   (a)   It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the Village
various structures used for residential and nonresidential use which are, or
may become in the future, substandard with respect to structure and
maintenance, or further, that such conditions, including, but not limited to,
structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of exterior of
premises, existence of fire hazards and unsanitary conditions, constitute a
menace to the health, safety, welfare and reasonable comfort of the residents
and inhabitants of the Village.
   (b)   It is further found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance
and progressive deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are
not curtailed and removed, the conditions shall grow and spread and shall
necessitate, in time, the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to
correct and eliminate the same, and that by reason of timely regulations and
restrictions as herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be
prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential
use and immediate neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and
welfare, protected and fostered.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.02 PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code is to protect the
public health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing
the maintenance, appearance and conditions of all residential and
nonresidential premises; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners
and operators; to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of
residential and nonresidential premises; to fix penalties for the violations of
this Code; and to provide for the right of access across adjoining premises to
permit repairs. This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for
the public interest and it is intended that this Code be liberally construed to
effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.03 APPLICABILITY.
   Every residential and nonresidential building and the premises on which it
is situated in the Village, used or intended to be used for dwelling, retail,
commercial, business, light manufacturing or industrial occupancy, shall comply
with the provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code, whether or not
such building was constructed, altered or repaired before or after the
enactment of this Code, and irrespective of any permits or licenses which were
issued for the use or occupancy of the building or for the installation or
repair of equipment or facilities prior to the effective date of this Code.
This Code establishes minimum standards for the initial and continued occupancy
and use of all such buildings and does not replace or modify standards
otherwise established for the construction, repair, alteration or use of the
building, except as provided in Section
1492.02. Where there is a mixed occupancy, residential or nonresidential use
therein shall be nevertheless regulated by and subject to the provisions of
this Code.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.04 CONFLICTS OF LAW; GREATER STANDARD TO PREVAIL.
    In any case where the provisions of this Code impose a higher standard than
set forth in any other Village ordinance or under State law, then the standards
as set forth herein shall prevail, but if the provisions of this Code impose a
lower standard than any other Village ordinance or of State law, then the
higher standard contained in any such ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.05 CONDITION FOR ISSUANCE AND RENEWAL OF PERMIT AND LICENSES.
   After the date of enactment of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code, all
licenses and permits shall be issued upon compliance with this Code as well as
compliance with the ordinances under which such licenses and permits are
granted.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.06 ENFORCEMENT OF AND COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
   No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this Exterior
Property Maintenance Code shall constitute a defense against any violation of
any other Village ordinance applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall
any provision herein relieve any owner, operator or occupant from complying
with any such other provisions, nor prohibit any Village official from
enforcing any such other provision.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.07 RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER, OPERATOR AND OCCUPANT INDEPENDENT OF EACH
OTHER.
   (a)   Owners and operators shall have the duties and responsibilities as
prescribed in this Exterior Property Maintenance Code and the regulations
promulgated pursuant hereto, and no owner or operator shall be relieved from
any such duty and responsibility nor be entitled to defend against any such
duty and responsibility nor not be entitled to defend against any charge of
violation thereof by reason of the fact that the occupant is also responsible
therefor and in violation thereof.
   (b)   Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Code, the respective
obligations and responsibilities of the owner and operator on one hand, and the
occupant on the other, shall not be altered or affected by an agreement or
contract by and between any of the aforesaid or between them and other parties.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.08 EXISTING OFFENSES AND VIOLATIONS NOT DISCHARGED.
   The repeal of any provisions of any other ordinances by this Exterior
Property Maintenance Code shall not affect any action for prosecution of
abatement under any such ordinance or any notice, complaint or order issued by
any officer or agency of the Village prior to the effective date hereof or
concerning a prosecution or other steps of enforcement which have been taken or
are being taken with any administrative agency or in the Municipal Court for
enforcement thereof.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1492.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates any provision of this Exterior Property Maintenance
Code shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be subject
to the penalty provided in Section
1428.99.
   (b)   Where the defendant is other than a natural person or persons,
subsection (a) hereof shall apply to any agent, superintendent, officer, member
or partner who, alone or with others, has charge, care or control of the
premises.
   (c)   The imposition of any penalty shall not preclude the Director of Law
from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a court of proper
jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful repair or maintenance; to restrain, correct
or abate a violation; to prevent the occupancy of a building, structure or
premises; or to require compliance with the provisions of this Code, other
applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations or the orders or
determinations of the Property Maintenance Officer.

1494.01 ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Building Inspector to be Property Maintenance Officer. The Building
Inspector (serving under direction of the Mayor) is hereby designated to serve
as the Property Maintenance Officer hereunder and all inspections, regulations,
enforcement and hearings on violations of the provisions of this Exterior
Property Maintenance Code, unless expressly stated to the contrary, shall be
under his or her direction and supervision. He or she may appoint or designate,
subject to the approval of the Mayor, such other public officials or employees
of the Village to perform duties as may be necessary for the enforcement of
this Code, including the making of inspections.
   (b)   When Inspections Are to be Made. All buildings and premises subject to
this Code are subject to inspections from time to time by the enforcing officer
of the Village. At the time of such inspections, all exterior parts of the
premises shall be available and accessible for such inspections, and the owner,
operator and occupant are required to provide the necessary arrangements to
facilitate such inspections. Such inspections shall be made during regular open
hours of the business occupying the premises unless there is reason to believe
a violation exists of a character which is an immediate threat to health or
safety requiring inspection and abatement without delay.
   (c)   Conduct of Inspector. Inspectors shall conduct themselves so as to
avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
   (d)   Where Access by Inspectors is Refused.
      (1)   Penalty. Where the Property Maintenance Officer or his or her agent
is refused access or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner, occupant
or operator from conducting an inspection of the premises, such person shall be
in violation of this Code and subject to the penalty in Section
1428.99.
      (2)   Search warrant or access warrant. In addition to the provisions of
paragraph (d)(1) hereof, the Property Maintenance Officer may, upon affidavit,
apply to the Municipal Court for a search warrant setting forth factually the
actual conditions and circumstances that provide a reasonable basis for
believing that a nuisance or violation of this Code exists on the premises and,
if the Court is satisfied as to the matter set forth in the affidavit, the
Court may authorize the issuance of a search warrant permitting access to the
inspection of that part of the premises on which the nuisance or violation
exists. Warrants for access may be issued by the Court upon affidavit of the
Property Maintenance Officer establishing grounds therefor.
   (e)   Procedure Where Violation Discovered. Where a violation of this Code
or the regulations hereunder is found to exist, a written notice from the
Property Maintenance Officer shall be served on the person or persons
responsible for the correction thereof.
      (1)   Service of notice. Notice may be served personally, by prepaid
telegram or by mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address
of the person to be served. Where it is ascertained that the owner does not
reside on the premises, the last known address shall be the address of the
owner as shown in the office of the County Auditor. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance
of the building. The Property Maintenance Officer shall file and provide notice
to any owner or operator of any violation at any address other than the last
known address provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the
Property Maintenance Officer personally or by certified mail addressed to the
Property Maintenance Officer. The date of service of the notice shall be
determined where service is by mail as of the day following the day of mailing
for notices to addresses within the Village, and as of the fourth day after the
day of service would fall upon a Sunday or other day when mail is not
ordinarily delivered, then the day of service shall be the next regular
delivery day. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, notice
served upon the agent designated shall constitute service upon the owner,
operator or lessor of the premises, jointly and severally. Where the owner,
operator or lessor or the agent thereof cannot be found at the address given,
the owner, operator or lessor affected thereby may be served by posting notice
upon the premises in a conspicuous place as near as possible to the front
entrance thereof.
      (2)   Notice to become an order unless hearing before the Planning
Commission. Within ten days of the date of service of a notice, the notice
shall constitute a final order unless any person affected by the notice
requests a hearing thereon before the Planning Commission and serves a written
request within the ten-day period in person or by mail to the Clerk of the
Planning Commission. Such request for a hearing before the Planning Commission
shall set forth briefly the grounds or reasons on which the request for a
hearing is based and the factual matters contained in the notice of violation
which are to be disputed at the hearing. The Clerk, upon receipt of the
request, shall, within thirty days therefrom and upon five days' notice to the
party aggrieved, set the matter down for hearing.
      (3)   Determination at hearing. At any hearing provided hereunder, the
Planning Commission shall be vested with all the powers provided by law to
compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in interest by issuance and
service of subpoenas, to require by subpoena the production of books, records,
or other documents at any such hearing which may be pertinent to matters to be
determined by him or her and to enforce any such subpoena or secure any order
for the enforcement of any such subpoena as provided by law. Determination
shall be made within ten days from the completion of the hearing. The Planning
Commission shall issue an order either incorporating the determinations and
directions contained in the notice or modifying the same, or withdrawing the
notice.
        (4)   Extension of time. The Property Maintenance Officer may extend
the time for correction or abatement of the violation for an additional period
of time not to exceed thirty days, except where major capital improvements or
renovations are involved, in which instance the time for completion may be
extended for a period not to exceed ninety days beyond the expiration date of
the original notice.
      (5)   Effect of noncompliance with notice. Whenever the owner, agent,
occupant or operator of a structure or premises fails, neglects or refuses to
comply with any notice of the Property Maintenance Officer that becomes a final
order as provided in paragraph (e)(2) hereof, the Property Maintenance Officer
may advise the Director of Law of the circumstances and request the Director to
institute an appropriate action at law to compel compliance.
      (6)   Referral of violations. Any violation of any ordinance other than
this Code discovered by the Property Maintenance Officer or his or her
representative shall be reported to the official or agency responsible for the
enforcement of such ordinance.
      (7)   Where notice and hearing not required prior to court proceedings.
Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) hereof,
violations of the following section may be prosecuted without notice by the
filing of a complaint by the Building Inspector.
      (8)   Effect of notice on owner. For the purposes of enforcement of this
Code, the service of a notice on an owner, whether or not the owner is also the
operator, shall constitute notice of the violation set forth therein until such
violation is abated in conformity with this Code and the other applicable
ordinances.
(Ord. 96-9-4. Passed 11-5-96.)
1494.02 POWERS AND DUTIES OF PROPERTY MAINTENANCE OFFICER.
   (a)   Adoption of Rules and Regulations. The Property Maintenance Officer is
hereby authorized and empowered to promulgate such written rules and
regulations as may be necessary for the proper interpretation and
administration of the provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code,
provided that such rules and regulations do not conflict with this Code and
conform to the general standards prescribed by this Code. The Property
Maintenance Officer shall file copies of such rules and regulations with the
Clerk of Council, the Administrative Engineer, the Fire Chief, and the Mayor,
and shall make available in the Property Maintenance Officer's office a copy
for inspection by members of the public during regular business hours. Such
rules and regulations shall have the approval of the Administrative Engineer
and the Fire Chief, respectively, where the provisions thereof relate to
matters which are also under the jurisdiction and supervision of each officer.
In case of conflict, the rule or regulation may be promulgated by direction of
the Council. Such rules and regulations shall have the same force and effect as
the provisions of this Code, and the violations thereof shall be enforced as
violations of the express provisions of this Code, as herein provided.
   (b)   Power to Vary or Modify Provisions of This Code. The Building
Commissioner shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement of the
requirements of this Code upon written application by an owner, operator or
occupant, after making a determination that:
        (1)   A.   Any variation or modification of a structure or use approved
by the Property Maintenance Officer shall not in any material way alter the
standards of this Code and cannot affect detrimentally the health or safety of
occupants or the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of
adjacent premises or of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.   Strict enforcement would constitute undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner or operator because it would compel expenditures on the
premises which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to
health, safety or welfare that might be derived therefrom; or
      (2)   The owner or operator is without any practical or feasible means to
comply with the strict provisions of the Code; or
      (3)   A.   The strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would
require the installation of repairs and improvements estimated to exceed five
hundred dollars ($500.00) in cost; and
         B.   The premises subject to this Code are contemplated for
acquisitions or are within an area where acquisition is contemplated by a
public agency having the power of eminent domain and there is a reasonable
likelihood that the premises shall be acquired and razed or moved within a
period of two years. However, any waiver of the provisions of this Code shall
be cancelled and the Property Maintenance Officer shall strictly enforce this
Code if it shall be ascertained subsequent to the granting of the waiver that
the premises are in fact not to be acquired for any public use or purpose.
      (4)   Right to hearing where application denied. Upon denial of any such
application, the owner, operator or applicant may request a hearing which shall
be held in accordance with provisions of Section
1494.01 (e)(2).
      (5)   Application not to constitute a defense or stay. Such application
shall not constitute a defense to any violation of this Code concerning any
proceedings which are pending in the Municipal Court when the application is
filed nor shall any variance or modification allowed hereunder constitute a
vested right against any ordinance enacted hereinafter by Council compelling
strict enforcement of any provisions of this Code.
      (6)   Record of variations or modifications granted. Where variations or
modifications are approved in any section of this Code by the Property
Maintenance Officer or by action of the Planning Commission, or any court, a
written record thereof stating the name of the applicant, the address of the
premises, the variation or modification approved, the date of approval and the
reasons therefor, satisfying the provisions contained herein, shall be prepared
by the Property Maintenance Officer and filed both under the section or
sections of this Code to which the variation or modification applies and under
the address of the premises, and such files shall be available for public
inspection in the office of the Property Maintenance Office during regular
