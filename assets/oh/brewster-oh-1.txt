         (i)   The eleventh day of November, known as Veteran’s Day;
         (j)   The fourth Thursday in November, known as Thanksgiving Day;
         (k)   The twenty-fifth day of December, known as Christmas Day; and
         (l)   Any day appointed and recommended by the Governor of this state
or the President of the United States as a holiday.
      (4)   If any day designated in this section as a legal holiday falls on a
Sunday, the next succeeding day is a legal holiday.
(R.C. § 1.14)
      (5)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a
day named, no part of that day shall be included. If priority of legal rights
depends upon the order of events on the same day, the priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred.
(R.C. § 1.15)
      (6)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
(R.C. § 1.45)
      (7)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or notice
shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance of the
duty or compliance with the notice.
   (D)   Numbers. If there is a conflict between figures and words in
expressing a number, the words govern.
(R.C. § 1.46)
   (E)   Authority. When the law requires an act to be done which may by law as
well be done by an agent as by the principal, the requirement shall be
construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (F)   Joint authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to three
or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving that
authority to a majority of the officers or other persons, unless it shall be
otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority, or it is
inconsistent with state law or municipal charter provisions.
   (G)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
contains any express provision excluding the construction, or when the subject
matter or context of the law is repugnant thereto.
§ 10.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (A)   The repeal of a repealing statute does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(R.C. § 1.57)
   (B)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal; or
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, the reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (B)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.
(R.C. § 1.23)
   (C)   A reference to any portion of a provision of this code applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(R.C. § 1.55)
   (D)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(R.C. § 1.56)
   (E)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified or renumbered, unless the subject matter has been
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the Village
Council are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Village Council, one amendment without reference to another,
the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given
to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date
of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language
deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an
earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of the error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this code and need not be inserted in
this code, but shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein.
   (B)   The following language may be used by the municipality to amend, add
or repeal a chapter, section or division:
      (1)   To amend a section: “Section            of the Municipal Code of
Ordinances is amended to read as follows: ....”

Ordinances, reads as follows: ....”

immediately following a division or section of this code, this indicates that
the text of the division or section is substantially equivalent to the
statutory provision.
Example: (R.C. § 2921.331)

   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred
or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The liabilities,
proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or forfeitures
shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted. In
particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-way,
contracts entered into or franchises granted, the acceptance, establishment or
vacation of any highway, and the election of corporate officers shall remain
valid in all respects, as if this code had not been enacted.

      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;

§ 30.04 EMPLOYEE WAGES AND BENEFITS.
   (A)   Annual review.
      (1)   Village employee wages, as well as listed employee benefits,
outlined in this section shall be reviewed by the Employee Compensation
Committee beginning in the first week of June of each calendar year.
      (2)   The Employee Compensation Committee shall consist of the Village
Clerk Treasurer, the Mayor, the Village Administrator, the Chair of the Council
Finance Committee, and any other individual assigned by Village Council.
      (3)   This review will be based on such factors including, but not
limited to: departmental evaluations, administrative evaluations, employee
performance evaluations, the fiscal health of the village, and other
circumstances that may affect the village at the time of the review.
      (4)   The review shall be completed by September 30 of that calendar year
and the recommendations shall be presented to Village Council for their
consideration.
      (5)   Village Council shall decide to adopt or modify the recommendations
as a part of the village budget for the next fiscal year. Village Council shall
do so prior to October 31 of the year that the recommendations were received by
them from the Employee Compensation Committee.
   (B)   Verification. This section outlines the wages for specific job titles,
available additives, and available stipends. Please note the final wage
accorded a specific employee is established by applying a specific job title’s
base wage and adding the appropriate additives and/or stipends for which that
specific employee has attained. These additives and stipends are based on years
of service, licenses obtained, and extended job duties. Each of these additives
or stipends is to be certified in writing and placed in the specific employee’s
employee file to provide verification. Such verification originates from the
State of Ohio for licenses and specific agencies for training certification,
and in such cases the appropriate department head and the Village Administrator
or the Mayor, as appropriate, shall provide verification in writing. In the
case of additives such as longevity, the Village Clerk-Treasurer will provide
verification in writing. For verification of extended job duties, the Village
Administrator shall provide such for the utility and street departments, and
the Mayor for the Police
and Fire Departments based on those department head’s recommendation. All
verifications shall be in writing and placed in the specific employee’s
employee file filed in Village Hall.
   (C)   Village employees’ wages will consist of the following factors:
 
Base wage
Applicable additives
Earned stipends
Final wage
   (D)   Pay Range Plans.
      (1)   For village employees within the Electric, Parks, Police, Street,
Wastewater, Water, Paramedic Services, and Administrative Departments a Pay
Range Plan shall be established. The Pay Range portion of the plan shall
consist of all Job Classifications assigned to specific pay grades as
determined by the Employee Compensation Committee and approved by Village
Council.
      (2)   The pay grades shall consist of a minimum, middle, and maximum rate
of pay determined by the Employee Compensation Committee. The Pay Range Plan
shall provide a flexible means of employee compensation based on the review
process outlined in division (A), Annual Review. Factors to be considered shall
include, but not limited to, ability, merit, longevity, applicable licenses and
training, appropriate educational accomplishments, and so forth.
   (E)   Implementation of Pay Range Plan.
      (1)   Within each village department there shall be different job
descriptions. The job descriptions shall be based on, but not limited to: the
knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the essential functions of
the job.
      (2)   In the initial implementation of a Pay Range Plan the compensation,
current employees will be progressed through the newly assigned pay grade based
on length of time employed with the village and length of time employed with
the village in the specific position. Employees will receive 75% credit for
years spent in the current position and 25% credit for additional years
employed by the village in a different capacity. For example, a Merchant
Lineman I who has been employed with the village for 15 continuous years, but
only five years as Merchant Lineman 1 would receive 6.25 years of service
credit and be placed 20% through the corresponding pay grade.
      (3)   Future employees shall be assigned to a pay grade that listed
herein. Department heads shall have the ability to hire within the pay grade
upon request and approval of the Village Council, but the starting rate of any
new employee shall never exceed the midpoint of the pay grade. The employee
will then move within the pay ranges of the pay grade based on annual reviews
as determined by the Employee Compensation Committee and Village Council.
      (4)   Job Classifications will be assigned to pay grades based on, but
not limited to, knowledge, experience, skills, and abilities needed to perform
the essential functions of the position.
      (5)   Beginning in June of each year, the Employee Compensation Committee
shall review the job performance of each village employee to determine if and
the amount of any additional compensation that should be accorded to each
employee during the following fiscal year. This determination shall be based on
job performance reviews and the recommendations of the applicable department
head, and the appropriate administrator or elected official. The department
heads and members of the administration shall provide such job performance
reviews or recommendations to the Employee Compensation Committee no later than
May 15th of each year.
      (6)   Any movement in compensation by an employee, except for additional
compensation for state licenses received, for additional compensation for
stipends for additional ranks or duties assigned, and for additional
compensation for additives earned, within the applicable pay range will require
the authorization of the majority of the Employee Compensation Committee and
the approval of the Village Council. This process shall be completed by
September 30 of that same calendar year.
      (7)   Recommendations for additional compensation or advancement requests
will be included in the annual budget preparation process and if approved will
not become effective until the following calendar year. Any increase in
compensation, bonuses, merit awards, or promotions will be subject to
sufficient available funding and the final budget approved by Village Council.
   (F)   Pay grades.

      (5)   The legislative authority of the village shall determine its own
rules and keep a journal of its proceedings.
(R.C. 731.45)

of the members present.
      (6)   The presiding officer shall preserve order and decorum and confine
members in debate to the question, subject to an appeal to the Council. In case

order, in which case the member called to order shall take his or her seat,

shall be limited to five minutes, or longer at the discretion of the Mayor or
presiding officer or Council by vote of a majority of those present.

available for public inspection and a copy placed in the mailbox of each member

specially named. At those meetings, no other business except that specifically
named in the call will be in order.

of the Council, chosen by Council, will preside. The designated chairperson
shall inform the Clerk-Treasurer who shall inform the public in advance of the
time and place of the meeting. Referral to this committee may take place when a
major situation or problem arises on which it is felt that every member of the

applicant or the possible investment or expenditure of public funds to be made
in connection with the economic development project.
      (2)   If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in this section, the motion and vote to hold that executive
session shall state which one or more of the approved matters listed in those
divisions are to be considered at the executive session.
      (3)   A resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid unless
adopted in an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule or formal

not open to the public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose
specifically authorized in an executive session held in compliance with this

residing in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and
shall be measured by municipal taxable income. The municipality shall tax

corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.
      (2)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 37-2015,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends §§

reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of
the net operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive
taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in
no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

(h)1. of this section.
               B.   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person

one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(h)3.A. of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

payment of interest under § 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former

         (b)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the municipality

   (A)   Collection at source; withholding from qualifying wages.
      (1)   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located
or doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an
amount equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in
the municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
division (B) of this section or division (A)(4) or (A)(6) of this section. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
         (b)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(A)(1)(a) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
may also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payment under division (A)(2)(b) of
this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this subchapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under §
36.083(A) of this chapter.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this subchapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator

municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this division (A), shall be personally liable for a
failure to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this division (A).
The dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be

         (g)   PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the location
in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days in a
calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee’s employer.
            1.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(a)1. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this division (B).
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2)(b) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (B)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services

such services in the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar
year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee’s principal place of work is located in the

               B.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than 20 days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages
as provided in division (A) of this section.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee’s principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(b)3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
subchapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division
(B)(2)(a) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (B)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         (c)   If an employer makes the election described in division (B)(4)
(b) of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during
those first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
36.077 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of §
36.079(A) of this chapter.
      (7)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a PETROLEUM REFINERY is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (B)(4) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds 12, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the
individual performed services at the refinery.
   (C)   Collection at source; casino and VLT.
      (1)   The municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in § 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. §
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
division (C).
      (2)   If a person’s winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by § 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct and
withhold municipal income tax from the person’s winnings at the rate of the tax
imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located.
      (3)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
         (a)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
municipality, providing the name, address, and Social Security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         (b)   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall file
an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the municipal
corporation in which the casino facility is located, indicating the total
amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The casino
operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any amount that was
deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If the name,
address, or Social Security number of a person or the amount deducted and
withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for that
reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual return.
         (c)   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall issue
an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount has been
deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The information
return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted from the
person’s winnings during the preceding year. The casino operator shall provide
to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information return issued under this
division. The Administrator may require that such copies be transmitted
electronically.
         (d)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         (e)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise
quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor
shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid; or
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
         (f)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by §
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent
shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize award at
the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video
lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.
         (a)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person’s name, address, and Social Security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this division (C).
         (b)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the municipality providing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         (c)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (C)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. §
5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant thereto.
         (4)   Annually, on or before January 31, each video lottery terminal
sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is located
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with the annual
return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously
remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a person or the
amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a
monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
         (e)   Annually, on or before January 31, a video lottery sales agent
shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount
has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The
information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted
and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video lottery sales agent
during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall provide to the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each information return
issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may require that such copies
be transmitted electronically.
         (f)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid; or
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this division (C), the
Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following
applicable penalty:
         (a)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted
and withheld under this division (C), a penalty equal to 50% of the tax
deducted and withheld;

prescribed in R.C. § 5703.47.
      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of §
36.081 of this chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this division (C).

§ 36.080 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   (A)   Determining municipal taxable income for taxpayers who are not
individuals. MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME for a taxpayer who is not an individual
for the municipality is calculated as follows: “Income” reduced by “exempt
income” to the extent otherwise included in income, multiplied by
apportionment, further reduced by any “pre-2017 net operating loss
carryforward” equals MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME.
      (1)   INCOME for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “net
profit” of the taxpayer.
         (a)   NET PROFIT for a person other than an individual is defined in §
36.077(C)(23).
         (b)   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME is defined in §
36.077(C)(1) of this chapter.
      (2)   EXEMPT INCOME is defined in §
36.077(C)(11) of this chapter.
      (3)   APPORTIONMENT means the apportionment as determined by §
36.080(B) of this chapter.
      (4)   PRE-2017 NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD is defined in §
36.077(C)(32) of this chapter.
   (B)   Net profit; income subject to net profit tax; alternative
apportionment. This division (B) applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business
or profession in the municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under R.C. Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, TANGIBLE PERSONAL OR REAL
PROPERTY shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight.
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual’s services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under §
36.079(B) of this chapter;
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (B)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality; or
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
36.093(A) of this chapter.
         (c)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
36.093(A) of this chapter.
         (d)   Nothing in division (B)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (B)(1)(b) of this section, WAGES, SALARIES, AND
OTHER COMPENSATION includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to
an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient; or
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (B)(3)(a)2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (B)(3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (B)(1)(c) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            2.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation
from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides. A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to
use separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(6)(b) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under §
36.082(A) of this chapter.
      (7)   (a)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable
income, the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted
to an employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the
employee’s income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted
from taxation under §
36.077(C)(11)(l) and (C)(34)(a)4. of this chapter, by a municipal corporation
to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer
be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         (b)   This division (B)(7) applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a
municipal corporation under this division (B).
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (B)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (C)   Consolidated federal income tax return.
      (1)   As used in this division (C):
         (a)   AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS means an affiliated group as
defined in § 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group
includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
         (b)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
         (c)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. CONSOLIDATED
FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section.
         (d)   INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
         (e)   LOCAL EXCHANGE TELEPHONE SERVICE has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
      (2)   (a)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
            2.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (C)(2)(b) of this section; or
            3.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this division (C) must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (C)(2)(a) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         (c)   An election made under division (C)(2)(a) or (b) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (C)(5)(b), (c), and
(d) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
36.077(C)(1) of this chapter, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable
income” for “federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears
in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for
“a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
36.077(C)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.080(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.080(B) of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
36.080(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this subchapter on the basis
of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under §
36.080(B) of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this subchapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the
corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more
members of such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (D)   Tax credit for businesses that foster new jobs in Ohio. The
municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
municipality. If a credit is granted under this division (D), it shall be
measured as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives
from new employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15
years. Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the
municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the
conditions of the credit.
   (E)   Tax credits to foster job retention. The municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in the municipality. If a
credit is granted under this division (E), it shall be measured as a percentage
of the income tax revenue the municipality derives from the retained employees
of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. Before the
municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

§ 36.081 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   ESTIMATED TAXES means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer’s tax liability for a municipal corporation’s
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   TAX LIABILITY means the total taxes due to a municipal corporation
for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is
entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or
credit from another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
DATE OF THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall
make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent
under R.C. § 718.031 are deemed to be paid to the municipal corporation for
which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes are withheld from the
taxpayer’s winnings.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
36.083(A)(7) of this chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in divisions (C)(1)
(a) through (d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with §
36.083(A) of this chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to R.C. § 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
36.084 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §
36.083(A) of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on January 1 of the calendar year that includes the
first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

Statutory reference:

§ 36.082 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (A)   Credit for tax paid to another municipality. Where a resident of this
municipality is subject to a municipal income tax in another municipality, he
shall not pay a total municipal income tax on the same income greater than the
tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   Refundable credit for qualifying loss.
      (1)   As used in this division (B):
         (a)   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN means a compensation
plan described in § 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section,
QUALIFYING LOSS means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the QUALIFYING LOSS is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (B)(1)(b)1. of this
section computed without regard to division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   QUALIFYING TAX RATE means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
QUALIFYING TAX RATE is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         (b)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this division
(B) from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income
tax with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more
taxable years.
         (c)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal
corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation
shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate
share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
division (B) exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   (a)   For purposes of this division (B), municipal corporation
income tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division (B) is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Credit for person working in joint economic development district or
zone. A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to §
36.082(A) of this chapter.
   (D)   Credit for tax beyond statute for obtaining refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
36.083(F) of this chapter.
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
36.083(F), the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carry forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment
is beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
36.083(F) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in this division (D) requires a municipality to allow
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has
reduced credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. §
36.082(A) of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

   (A)   Return and payment of tax.
      (1)   (a)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the

         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under §
36.079(A)(3) of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
municipality.
         (c)   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the municipality,

required by the municipality in accordance with this subchapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual’s duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary

support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
      (5)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
      (6)   (a)   Each return required to be filed under this division (A)
shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized
agent and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall
include the taxpayer’s Social Security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
         (b)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with
each annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
division (A), copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s
Internal Revenue Service form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all

qualified municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended
tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the
refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this division (A)
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
         (c)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include,
with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for
refund required under this division (A), copies of only the following
documents: the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form

available, submit
the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a portal
provided by municipality. The Department of Taxation shall publish a method of
electronically submitting the documents required under this division through
the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department shall
transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to the
appropriate Tax Administrator.
         (e)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (A)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (f)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   (a)   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this division (A) shall
be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under
R.C. §
5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each annual
net profit income tax return required to be filed under this division (A) by a
taxpayer that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by
the Tax Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
following the end of the taxpayer’s taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall
complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax
Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the
municipality or Tax Administrator.
            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with
this subchapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns
and make payments otherwise than as provided in this division (A), including
taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         (c)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
36.083(B) of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in §
36.083(B) of this chapter, the provision in §
36.083(B) of this chapter prevails.
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) and (d) of
this section.
      (9)   This division (A)(9) shall not apply to payments required to be
made under §
36.079(A)(2)(b) of this chapter.
         (a)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this subchapter is delivered after that
period or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which
the report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
THE DATE OF POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (b)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to
an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments,
except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
division (A), SUBMITTED THE PAYMENT means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in §
36.079(A) of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division (A) shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to
authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return. The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate
that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to
contact the preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the
examination or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other
person only to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing
from the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the
examination or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s
refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors,
offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax
Administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by
the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about
matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this subchapter, provided that the generic
form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this subchapter and of
the municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   (a)   As used in this division, WORKSITE LOCATION has the same
meaning as in §
36.079(B) of this chapter.
         (b)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
subchapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this subchapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (A)(14)
(b) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this subchapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (A)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax; individuals serving in combat zone.
      (1)   Each member of the National Guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this subchapter during the period of the member’s or civilian’s
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member’s or civilian’s duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this division (B), the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(2)(c) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract
terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this division (B), the applicant shall neither
be required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required
to pay any tax otherwise due to the municipality before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division
(B)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this subchapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division (B), QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the
National Guard or a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (B)(3)(b)1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (B)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2)(b) and (c) or
(B)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for
that year.
   (C)   Use of Ohio Business Gateway; types of filings authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this division (C) affects the due dates for filing
employer withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this division (C) shall be construed as limiting or
removing the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and
enforce the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (D)   Extension of time to file.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this subchapter is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   (a)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance with
this subchapter must be altered.
         (b)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
         (c)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
      (2)   (a)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (E)(2)(b) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
36.093 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
         (b)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   (a)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by §
36.19(A)(2) of this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no
refund need be paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (E)(3)(b) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in §
36.083(F) of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (E)(3)(b) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return.
         (b)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (F)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the municipality, in accordance with this division (F), shall refund to
employers, agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any
income or withholding tax levied by the municipality:
         (a)   Overpayments of more than $10; and
         (b)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
      (2)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, returns
setting forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator,
within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         (b)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (F)
(2)(c) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         (c)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
36.092 of this chapter.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (F)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
         (a)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;
         (b)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day; or
         (c)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
36.084(A)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this division (F), WITH-HOLDING TAX has the same meaning
as in §
36.084 of this chapter.

oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,

income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this subchapter;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

taxpayer’s assigns, or legal representative as provided in this subchapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

and orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator’s own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law; and
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §
36.079(A) of this chapter.
   (B)   Authority of Tax Administrator; compromise of claim and payment over
time.
      (1)   As used in this division (B), CLAIM means a claim for an amount
payable to the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this subchapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the municipality:
         (a)   Compromise a claim; or
         (b)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment- over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties
to the compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect
the liability of any other person.
      (5)   (a)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer’s failure
to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator
shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (C)   Authority of Tax Administrator; right to examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this subchapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this subchapter. Upon written request
by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this division (C) is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this subchapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person’s
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this division (C) shall
fail to comply.
   (D)   Authority of Tax Administrator; requiring identifying information.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person’s Social Security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this subchapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom

§ 36.090 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR means an opinion issued under this
section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not
include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer’s request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts;
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this subchapter; and
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an “opinion of the Tax Administrator.”
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality’s
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances; or
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
36.089 of this chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section; and
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has
requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event shall
the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) above may not be appealed.

§ 36.091 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. §
718.18 is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the
assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

§ 36.092 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   (a)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         (b)   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be
domiciled in the municipality, but the appointing authority may consider
membership from individuals who are not domiciled within the municipality.
         (c)   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an
employee of the municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the board’s final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board’s
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral

agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in §
36.092 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
36.083(F) of this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §
36.092 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’s
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by §
36.083(F) of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in §
36.077(C)(47) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the
election;
      (2)   The Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter
5703.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the village, on a form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   (a)   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the

until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the village of its
termination of the election.
         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

   (C)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer §§

      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the

§ 36.111 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in §§
36.110  to
36.125  of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in R.C. Title
LVII, unless the term is defined in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the
definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the
Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to
federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and §
36.077  of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in §§
36.110  to
36.125  of the Codified Ordinances. As used in §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)   MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME. Income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under §
36.077 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carry forward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. For a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation as
described in R.C. § 718.01(D)(5) and §
36.077 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of

36.110 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under §
36.079 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
36.120(A) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
36.120(A) of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court- martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee' s presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the village
as follows:

meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the village from
a stock of goods located within the village.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the village from a location
outside the village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
village to the extent that such services are performed in the village.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the village shall be sitused to the village.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and

tangible personal property is used in the village.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under §
36.077(C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of the Codified Ordinances by the village or
substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal
corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the village. In no case shall
a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the
village any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation. This division applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the
village under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer

basis for the referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by

discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the

§
36.080 (B)(1) or (2) of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the Tax

      (5)   When an election made under §
36.080  of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations

shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.

deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.116 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net

separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in §
36.116 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group'
s net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under §
36.116 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for taxpayer "wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.

   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   COMBINED TAX LIABILITY means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   ESTIMATED TAXES means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least $200.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on or
before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes subject to
tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 67.5% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the 15th day of the 12th month of the taxable year,
90% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in R.C. §
718.85(B).
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return for
that year.
(Ord. 06-2018, passed 2-20-2018)
§ 36.119 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties
shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax
Commissioner, the Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding $25 per month
or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between
the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed $150.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the Commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of the amount
required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
36.110 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
15% of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to $500 may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of $1,000 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
§ 36.110 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of $1,000 or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under §
36.121 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under §§
36.110 to
36.125 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under R.C. §
718.83.
(Ord. 06-2018, passed 2-20-2018)
§ 36.120 ASSESSMENT AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under §§
36.110  to
36.125  of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner's
possession. The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against
a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in §
36.114  of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by §§
36.088  to
36.093  and
36.120  of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in R.C. § 5703.37. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within 60
days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the Office of
the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
      (1)   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a
judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The
judgment may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special
judgments for municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other
judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
      (2)   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 60 days after
the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of
tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47
from the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is
paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under R.C.
§ 131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section
R.C. § 5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the Clerk of the
Court of Common Pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the Clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition. If
upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by §
36.121 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. 06-2018, passed 2-20-2018)
§ 36.121 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under §§
36.082 to
36.083 of the Codified Ordinances or pursuant to §§
36.110  to
36.125, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by §
36.120(A) of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the
form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than $10 and not less than that claimed,
the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget and
management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than $10 but less than
that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within 90 days after such determination shall bear interest
at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the 91st day after such
determination until the day the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or
erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that rate from the date of
payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the day the refund is paid
or credited.
(Ord. 06-2018, passed 2-20-2018)
§ 36.122 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
36.110 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under §§
36.110  to
36.125  of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than 60 days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under §
36.120 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the 60-day period prescribed for filing the amended
return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in §
36.121 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer' s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
36.114 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 06-2018, passed 2-20-2018)
§ 36.123 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to §§
36.110  to
36.125  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the Commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to §§
36.110  to
36.125  of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
Commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the village and taxpayer under §§
36.082(A) to (D) of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or
conditions of any such existing agreement.

(Ord. 58-2023, passed 11-20-2023)
VILLAGE SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY
§ 37.20 GENERAL.
   (A)   At this point and time the village prohibits the use of any village
computer or internet connection for personal use. Any use of a village computer
is to be confined to that of conducting village business. That said the village
realizes as the social media on the internet evolves, there will be instances
that official village business may involve the use of said social media sites.
The social media policy outlined on the following sections are intended to
address that use.
   (B)   As with all technologies, there are challenges inherent to their use.
In order to address these challenges the following guidelines have been created
to help our employees use social media tools both in and out of the village
work day. The village expects all employees who participate in social media on
behalf of the village to understand and follow these guidelines. This policy is
not intended to be all encompassing. As technologies change, the application of
this policy will be evaluated on a case- by-case basis.
(Ord. 20-2014, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 37.21 BASIC GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Be accurate. Before posting content or responding to comments, ensure
that the information or response is accurate. Accuracy is critical, because
content on social media platforms is extremely visible and can be replicated in
multiple locations within minutes.
   (B)   Correct mistakes. If a mistake or inaccuracy is found, correct the
mistake and communicate its subsequent correction clearly and quickly.
   (C)   Be considerate. Ensure that all communication is professional,
respectful and factual. Remember that all content represents the village.
   (D)   Misrepresentation. Only employees who are authorized to speak on
behalf of their respective departments and/or areas of expertise should do so.
Concealing or misrepresenting one’s name or affiliation to mask unauthorized,
fraudulent, irresponsible or offensive behavior in electronic communications is
strictly prohibited.
   (E)   Protect sensitive or personal information. The village is entrusted
with a variety of sensitive and personal information. When sharing content on
social media platforms, do not share confidential or personal information. If
there is a question as to whether the information is appropriate, consult with
the Village Administrator or Village Solicitor.
   (F)   Avoid advertisements, sponsorships and endorsements. When possible,
avoid advertisements, endorsements or sponsorships on social media platforms.
Context-sensitive ads may appear on some platforms that do not reflect the
views or positions of the village.
   (G)   Respect copyrights and trademarks. When posting content do not
infringe upon copyright or trademark protections.
   (H)   Use village email addresses and strong passwords. Village email
addresses should be used to confirm to users that the content provided is
official. Personal email accounts should not be used for official village
communications through social media platforms. Strong passwords (letters,
numbers and the like) will reduce possible security breaches.
   (I)   Remember the village restricts the use of village computers to
“business only” use, and reserves the right to monitor and review the use of
all village computers. All material and information created, sent, saved,
reviewed, accessed or stored are the property of the village.
(Ord. 20-2014, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 37.22 APPROPRIATE CONTENT.
   (A)   All content represents the village and its departments. Unacceptable
usage of social media platforms includes content which violates or supports/
encourages the violation of local, state and federal law. Content which
solicits money for or supports political causes is strictly prohibited. All
content must be factual, credible, professional and useful to the village’s
residents and functions.
   (B)   Use the guidelines below to manage the appropriateness of social media
content. Also, please include a disclosure link which explains that the village
reserves the right to delete or block the following types of content:
      (1)   Vulgar or offensive language;
      (2)   Content (or a user) that promotes, fosters or perpetuates
discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, age, religion, gender,
marital status, status with regard to public assistance, national origin,
physical or mental disability, genetic testing or sexual orientation;
      (3)   Spam;
      (4)   Content that advocates illegal activity;
      (5)   Promotion of particular goods and services;
      (6)   Content which supports or opposes political campaigns or ballot
measures;
      (7)   Infringement upon copyrights or trademarks; and
      (8)   Information that may compromise the safety or security of the
public or public systems.
   (C)   The following is a list of issues to consider regarding implementation
of social media communications.
      (1)   Use common sense. Do not post any content that would not be
appropriate in other forms of media. Apply the same rules to social media
platforms applied to traditional forms of communications, such as emails, press
releases and web sites.
      (2)   Correct misinformation. It is important that users correct
misinformation disseminated by employees or external users. Village employees
should identify themselves and correct the mistake with respect and factual
information. Most users won’t mind being corrected and will most likely
distribute the correction.
      (3)   Do not violate confidentiality rule. Know what information can be
shared with the public. Do not violate the village’s privacy, confidentiality
or legal guidelines. Never comment on anything related to legal matters,
litigation or any parties the village may be in litigation with, without
appropriate approval.
      (4)   Public records: employees should be aware that any content posted
on social media platforms could be considered a public record, and therefore
original content must be retained in accordance with the appropriate state and
village record retention schedules.
   (D)   Village Administrator/social media role: the Village Administrator
shall oversee any social media communication involving village departments and
employees. The Village Administrator will coordinate all social media activity
within all village departments. His or her role should include determining if
content is appropriate, relevant and disseminating corrections and ensuring
that all social media platforms remain current and up-to-date. He or she should
establish a management process to release and retire content, as well as
monitor user comments if enabled. If your department wishes to use social media
for your department’s business please contact the Village Administrator to
discuss such use. Only authorized participants should contribute and represent
the village.
(Ord. 20-2014, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 37.23 REPRESENTING THE VILLAGE.
   (A)   It is important to remember social media can blur the lines of “on
duty” and “off duty.” When an employee self-identifies as, or is otherwise
reasonably understood or represented to be a village employee on a social media
platform he or she should consider their behavior to be a reflection of the
village at all times. Employees are advised that all village related content
offered on social media platforms, either on work or personal time, may be
evaluated for a reasonable connection to the policies and function of the
village. Any content offered that is found to be contrary to the policies of
the village, harm or bring disrepute to the village may be grounds for
discipline.
   (B)   It is imperative that employees involved in social media activities
adhere to all guidelines presented here. Department heads will ultimately be
held accountable for all content disseminated by their department’s staff.
   (C)   The following are some additional guidelines for employees related to
the professional content sharing.
      (1)   Public servants are held to a higher standard. Always be honest and
respectful.
      (2)   Use the guidelines outlined in this policy to determine what
content is appropriate to disseminate. If you are unsure, it is always best to
seek approval from your supervisor, the Village Administrator or the Village
Solicitor.
      (3)   Unless you have prior approval, you are not authorized to speak on
behalf of the village or your department, nor represent that you do. Employees
will be held accountable for misrepresenting the village on the internet.
      (4)   Refrain from commenting on the work of colleagues in this or other
organizations that are outside of your field of expertise. When commenting on
your area of expertise, always disclose your professional credentials.
      (5)   When you post to outside networks, consider adding a disclaimer to
your post that your views do not necessarily represent the village’s views.
(Ord. 20-2014, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 37.24 PRIVACY AND SECURITY.
   (A)   As with any type of communication, there is a certain degree of risk
associated with participation on social media platforms. Just as privacy and
security are carefully accounted for and monitored on village web sites and
personally identifiable information is not shared through traditional
communication mediums, such as press releases, the same approach applies to
social media engagement.
   (B)   When sharing content on social media platforms, make sure it is public
content and not confidential, critical or personally identifiable information.
R.C. Chapter 1347 provides guidance on what is considered personally
identifiable information.
(Ord. 20-2014, passed 5-19-2014)
INVESTMENT POLICY
§ 37.35 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this document is to identify the policies that will
govern the investment activities of the village with regard to the management
of the funds available for investment. In addition, the policy is to provide
the prudent management of all funds available for investment in accordance with
the stated investment philosophy. As custodians of public funds, the village,
in particular the Clerk-Treasurer of the village and all village officials and
employees will adhere to this policy, and where this policy is silent, will
default to R.C. § 135.14.
   (B)   These policies are designed to ensure the prudent management of funds
available for investment, conformance to the Ohio Revised Code, federal law
where applicable, the availability of operating and capital funds when needed,
and an investment return comparable with similar funds and financial market
indices.
   (C)   All staff with the authority to participate in the investment process
shall act responsibly as custodians of the trust bestowed upon them by the
Council of the village. The overall program shall be designed and managed with
a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust.
(Ord. 01-2013, passed 1-7-2013)
§ 37.36 SCOPE OF INVESTMENT POLICY.
   This policy applies to the investment of all moneys of the village. This
policy applies to all funds for the village, unless otherwise dictated by law
or by contract on agreement, and in all cases shall comply with all applicable
indentures, trust instruments, financing agreements and the like to which the
village is bound. The guidance set forth herein shall be strictly followed by
all village officials or employees responsible for any aspect of the management
or administration of village funds.
(Ord. 01-2013, passed 1-7-2013)
§ 37.37 AUTHORIZATION.
   Investments shall be approved for day-to-day operations by the Clerk-
Treasurer, so long as those investments fall within the confines of investments
approved within this investment policy.
(Ord. 01-2013, passed 1-7-2013)
§ 37.38 INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY.
   (A)   The Clerk-Treasurer and all other persons who are responsible for
investing funds have fiduciary responsibilities to the Village Council. Such
persons shall seek to follow an investment strategy based on the “prudent
person” standard. The prudent person standard requires the Clerk-Treasurer to
exercise care and skill that a prudent person would use to manage his or her
personal financial affairs. The prudent person standard requires the Clerk-
Treasurer to seek investments, which will preserve principal while maximizing
income.
   (B)   The Clerk-Treasurer, acting in accordance with this policy or any
other written procedures approved by Council pertaining to the administration
and management of funds available for investment and who exercise the proper
due diligence, shall be considered to be acting within the scope of authority
of the office. Any deviation from the investment policy set forth herein shall
be reported immediately to the Mayor, the Finance Committee Chair and the
Village Administrator. The Clerk-Treasurer shall take appropriate action
immediately to mitigate to the extent possible any further adverse effects of a
particular investment and to ensure that such an investment is consistent with
the investment objectives set forth herein.
(Ord. 01-2013, passed 1-7-2013)
§ 37.39 INVESTMENT/INVESTMENTS OBJECTIVES.
   Investments shall be managed to accomplish the following hierarchy of
objectives.
   (A)   Preservation of principal.
      (1)   The single most important objective of each investment is the
preservation of principal of those funds within the investments.
      (2)   It is recognized that occasional losses are inevitable and such
possibility will be considered in evaluating diversification decisions and
investment strategy.
   (B)   Maintenance of liquidity.
      (1)   The investments shall be managed in such a manner that assures that
funds are available as needed to meet those immediate and/or future operating
requirements of the village. Once cash flow requirements have been satisfied,
maturity date selection will be determined by market conditions and interest
rate forecasts.
      (2)   No investment will be made unless at the time the investment is
made the Clerk-Treasurer reasonably believes that the investment can be held
until maturity. However, an investment may be sold prior to maturity if the
Clerk-Treasurer determines that such sale is prudent.
   (C)   Maximize return. Investments shall be managed in such a fashion as to
attain a market- average rate of return throughout budgetary and economic
cycles, within the context and parameters set forth by divisions (A) and (B)
above.
   (D)   Minimize cost of services. The fourth objective is to minimize
transaction costs. To meet this objective, relationships with securities
dealers, investment bankers and other entities providing investment services
will be carefully managed to secure high quality services at the lowest
reasonable costs.
(Ord. 01-2013, passed 1-7-2013)
§ 37.40 AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS.
   The Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to invest funds in accordance with R.C. §
135.14. This policy recognizes that as changes in the law are made to R.C. §
135.14, those investments allowed or disallowed will be adhered to as part of
this policy. As of this writing R.C. § 135.14 reads as follows:
§ 135.14 Investment of political subdivision interim moneys.
 
   (A)   As used in this section:
 
      (1)   “Treasurer” does not include the treasurer of state, and “governing board” does
not include the state board of deposit.
 
      (2)   “Other obligations” includes notes whether or not issued in anticipation of the
issuance of bonds.
 
   (B)   The treasurer or governing board may invest or deposit any part or all of the
interim moneys. The following classifications of obligations shall be eligible for such
investment or deposit:
 
      (1)   United States treasury bills, notes, bonds, or any other obligation or security
issued by the United States treasury or any other obligation guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the United States.
 
      Nothing in the classification of eligible obligations set forth in division (B)(1) of
this section or in the classifications of eligible obligations set forth in divisions (B)(2)
to (7) of this section shall be construed to authorize any investment in stripped principal
or interest obligations of such eligible obligations.

federal government agency or instrumentality, including but not limited to, the federal
national mortgage association, federal home loan bank, federal farm credit bank, federal home

in accordance with section 135.09 of the Revised Code and the treasurer or the governing
board shall determine the periods for which such interim deposits are to be made and shall
award such interim deposits for such periods, provided that any eligible institution
receiving an interim deposit award may, upon notification that the award has been made,
decline to accept the interim deposit in which event the award shall be made as though the
institution had not applied for such interim deposit.
 
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of this state , or the political subdivisions of this
state, provided that, with respect to bonds or other obligations of political subdivisions,
all of the following apply:
 
         (a)   The bonds or other obligations are payable from general revenues of the
political subdivision and backed by the full faith and credit of the political subdivision.
 
         (b)   The bonds or other obligations are rated at the time of purchase in the three
highest classifications established by at least one nationally recognized standard rating
service and purchased through a registered securities broker or dealer.
 
         (c)   The aggregate value of the bonds or other obligations does not exceed twenty
per cent of interim moneys available for investment at the time of purchase.
 
         (d)   The treasurer or governing board is not the sole purchaser of the bonds or
other obligations at original issuance.
 
      No investment shall be made under division (B)(4) of this section unless the treasurer
or governing board has completed additional training for making the investments authorized by
division (B)(4) of this section. The type and amount of additional training shall be approved
by the treasurer of state and may be conducted by or provided under the supervision of the
treasurer of state.
 
      (5)   No-load money market mutual funds consisting exclusively of obligations described
in division (B)(1) or (2) of this section and repurchase agreements secured by such
obligations, provided that investments in securities described in this division are made only
through eligible institutions mentioned in section 135.03 of the Revised Code;
 
      (6)   The Ohio subdivision’s fund as provided in section 135.45 of the Revised Code;

            (i)   The notes are rated at the time of purchase in the highest classification
established by at least two nationally recognized standard rating services.
 
            (ii)   The aggregate value of the notes does not exceed ten per cent of the

         (b)   Bankers acceptances of banks that are insured by the federal deposit insurance
corporation and that mature not later than one hundred eighty days after purchase.
 
      No investment shall be made pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section unless the
treasurer or governing board has completed additional training for making the investments
authorized by division (B)(7) of this section. The type and amount of additional training
shall be approved by the treasurer of state and may be conducted by or provided under the
supervision of the treasurer of state.
 
   (C)   Nothing in the classifications of eligible obligations set forth in divisions (B)(1)
to (7) of this section shall be construed to authorize any investment in a derivative, and no
treasurer or governing board shall invest in a derivative. For purposes of this division,
“derivative” means a financial instrument or contract or obligation whose value or return is
based upon or linked to another asset or index, or both, separate from the financial
instrument, contract, or obligation itself. Any security, obligation, trust account, or other
instrument that is created from an issue of the United States treasury or is created from an
obligation of a federal agency or instrumentality or is created from both is considered a
derivative instrument. An eligible investment described in this section with a variable
interest rate payment, based upon a single interest payment or single index comprised of
other eligible investments provided for in division (B)(1) or (2) of this section, is not a
derivative, provided that such variable rate investment has a maximum maturity of two years.
 
   (D)   Except as provided in division (E) of this section, any investment made pursuant to
this section must mature within five years from the date of settlement, unless the investment
is matched to a specific obligation or debt of the subdivision.
 
   (E)   The treasurer or governing board may also enter into a written repurchase agreement
with any eligible institution mentioned in section 135.03 of the Revised Code or any eligible
dealer pursuant to division (M) of this section, under the terms of which agreement the
treasurer or governing board purchases, and such institution or dealer agrees unconditionally
to repurchase any of the securities listed in divisions (B)(1) to (5), except letters of
credit described in division (B)(2), of section 135.18 of the Revised Code. The market value
of securities subject to an overnight written repurchase agreement must exceed the principal
value of the overnight written repurchase agreement by at least two per cent. A written
repurchase agreement shall not exceed thirty days and the market value of securities subject
to a written repurchase agreement must exceed the principal value of the written repurchase
agreement by at least two per cent and be marked to market daily. All securities purchased
pursuant to this division shall be delivered into the custody of the treasurer or governing
board or an agent designated by the treasurer or governing board. A written repurchase
agreement with an eligible securities dealer shall be transacted on a delivery versus payment
basis. The agreement shall contain the requirement that for each transaction pursuant to the
agreement the participating institution or dealer shall provide all of the following
information:
 
      (1)   The par value of the securities;
 
      (2)   The type, rate, and maturity date of the securities;
 
      (3)   A numerical identifier generally accepted in the securities industry that
designates the securities.
 
      No treasurer or governing board shall enter into a written repurchase agreement under
the terms of which the treasurer or governing board agrees to sell securities owned by the
subdivision to a purchaser and agrees with that purchaser to unconditionally repurchase those
securities.
 
   (F)   No treasurer or governing board shall make an investment under this section, unless
the treasurer or governing board, at the time of making the investment, reasonably expects
that the investment can be held until its maturity.
 
   (G)   No treasurer or governing board shall pay interim moneys into a fund established by
another subdivision, treasurer, governing board, or investing authority, if that fund was
established for the purpose of investing the public moneys of other subdivisions. This
division does not apply to the payment of public moneys into either of the following:
 
      (1)   The Ohio subdivision’s fund pursuant to division (B)(6) of this section;
 
      (2)   A fund created solely for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, owning,
leasing, or operating municipal utilities pursuant to the authority provided under section
715.02 of the Revised Code or Section 4 of Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution.
 
      For purposes of division (G) of this section, “subdivision” includes a county.
 
   (H)   The use of leverage, in which the treasurer or governing board uses its current
investment assets as collateral for the purpose of purchasing other assets, is prohibited.
The issuance of taxable notes for the purpose of arbitrage is prohibited. Contracting to sell
securities that have not yet been acquired by the treasurer or governing board, for the
purpose of purchasing such securities on the speculation that bond prices will decline, is
prohibited.
 
   (I)   Whenever, during a period of designation, the treasurer classifies public moneys as
interim moneys, the treasurer shall notify the governing board of such action. The
notification shall be given within thirty days after such classification and in the event the
governing board does not concur in such classification or in the investments or deposits made
under this section, the governing board may order the treasurer to sell or liquidate any of
such investments or deposits, and any such order shall specifically describe the investments
or deposits and fix the date upon which they are to be sold or liquidated. Investments or
deposits so ordered to be sold or liquidated shall be sold or liquidated for cash by the
treasurer on the date fixed in such order at the then current market price. Neither the
treasurer nor the members of the board shall be held accountable for any loss occasioned by
sales or liquidations of investments or deposits at prices lower than their cost. Any loss or
expense incurred in making such sales or liquidations is payable as other expenses of the
treasurer’s office.
 
   (J)   If any investments or deposits purchased under the authority of this section are
issuable to a designated payee or to the order of a designated payee, the name of the
treasurer and the title of the treasurer’s office shall be so designated. If any such
securities are registrable either as to principal or interest, or both, then such securities
shall be registered in the name of the treasurer as such.
 
   (K)   The treasurer is responsible for the safekeeping of all documents evidencing a
deposit or investment acquired by the treasurer under this section. Any securities may be
deposited for safekeeping with a qualified trustee as provided in section 135.18 of the
Revised Code, except the delivery of securities acquired under any repurchase agreement under
this section shall be made to a qualified trustee, provided, however, that the qualified
trustee shall be required to report to the treasurer, governing board, auditor of state, or
an authorized outside auditor at any time upon request as to the identity, market value, and
location of the document evidencing each security, and that if the participating institution
is a designated depository of the subdivision for the current period of designation, the
securities that are the subject of the repurchase agreement may be delivered to the treasurer
or held in trust by the participating institution on behalf of the subdivision. Interest
earned on any investments or deposits authorized by this section shall be collected by the
treasurer and credited by the treasurer to the proper fund of the subdivision.
 
      Upon the expiration of the term of office of a treasurer or in the event of a vacancy
in the office of treasurer by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, or
otherwise, the treasurer or the treasurer’s legal representative shall transfer and deliver
to the treasurer’s successor all documents evidencing a deposit or investment held by the
treasurer. For the investments and deposits so transferred and delivered, such treasurer
shall be credited with and the treasurer’s successor shall be charged with the amount of
money held in such investments and deposits.
 
   (L)   Whenever investments or deposits acquired under this section mature and become due
and payable, the treasurer shall present them for payment according to their tenor, and shall
collect the moneys payable thereon. The moneys so collected shall be treated as public moneys
subject to sections
135.01 to
135.21 of the Revised Code.
 
   (M)   (1)   All investments, except for investments in securities described in divisions
(B)(5) and (6) of this section and for investments by a municipal corporation in the issues
of such municipal corporation, shall be made only through a member of the financial industry
regulatory authority (FINRA), through a bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association
regulated by the superintendent of financial institutions, or through an institution
regulated by the comptroller of the currency, federal deposit insurance corporation, or board
of governors of the federal reserve system.
 
      (2)   Payment for investments shall be made only upon the delivery of securities
representing such investments to the treasurer, governing board, or qualified trustee. If the
securities transferred are not represented by a certificate, payment shall be made only upon
receipt of confirmation of transfer from the custodian by the treasurer, governing board, or
qualified trustee.
 
   (N)   In making investments authorized by this section, a treasurer or governing board may
retain the services of an investment advisor, provided the advisor is licensed by the
division of securities under section 1707.141 of the Revised Code or is registered with the
securities and exchange commission, and possesses experience in public funds investment
management, specifically in the area of state and local government investment portfolios, or
the advisor is an eligible institution mentioned in section 135.03 of the Revised Code.
 
   (O)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (O)(2) and (3) of this section, no
treasurer or governing board shall make an investment or deposit under this section, unless
there is on file with the auditor of state a written investment policy approved by the
treasurer or governing board. The policy shall require that all entities conducting
investment business with the treasurer or governing board shall sign the investment policy of
that subdivision. All brokers, dealers, and financial institutions, described in division (M)
(1) of this section, initiating transactions with the treasurer or governing board by giving
advice or making investment recommendations shall sign the treasurer’s or governing board’s
investment policy thereby acknowledging their agreement to abide by the policy’s contents.
All brokers, dealers, and financial institutions, described in division (M)(1) of this
section, executing transactions initiated by the treasurer or governing board, having read
the policy’s contents, shall sign the investment policy thereby acknowledging their
comprehension and receipt.
 
      (2)   If a written investment policy described in division (O)(1) of this section is
not filed on behalf of the subdivision with the auditor of state, the treasurer or governing
board of that subdivision shall invest the subdivision’s interim moneys only in interim
deposits pursuant to division (B)(3) of this section or interim deposits pursuant to section
135.145 of the Revised Code and approved by the treasurer of state, no-load money market
mutual funds pursuant to division (B)(5) of this section, or the Ohio subdivision’s fund
pursuant to division (B)(6) of this section.
 
      (3)   Divisions (O)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to a treasurer or governing
board of a subdivision whose average annual portfolio of investments held pursuant to this
section is one hundred thousand dollars or less, provided that the treasurer or governing
board certifies, on a form prescribed by the auditor of state, that the treasurer or
governing board will comply and is in compliance with the provisions of sections
135.01 to
135.21 of the Revised Code.
 
   (P)   A treasurer or governing board may enter into a written investment or deposit
agreement that includes a provision under which the parties agree to submit to nonbinding
arbitration to settle any controversy that may arise out of the agreement, including any
controversy pertaining to losses of public moneys resulting from investment or deposit. The
arbitration provision shall be set forth entirely in the agreement, and the agreement shall
include a conspicuous notice to the parties that any party to the arbitration may apply to
the court of common pleas of the county in which the arbitration was held for an order to
vacate, modify, or correct the award. Any such party may also apply to the court for an order
to change venue to a court of common pleas located more than one hundred miles from the
county in which the treasurer or governing board is located.
 
   For purposes of this division, “investment or deposit agreement” means any agreement
between a treasurer or governing board and a person, under which agreement the person agrees
to invest, deposit, or otherwise manage a subdivision’s interim moneys on behalf of the
treasurer or governing board, or agrees to provide investment advice to the treasurer or
governing board.

IDENTITY THEFT POLICY
§ 37.60 BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the municipality, its employees and customers from data loss and
identity theft is of significant concern to the municipality and can be reduced
only through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor.
(Res. 26-2008, passed 10-20-2008)
§ 37.61 PURPOSE.

distributed; and
      (4)   Place the municipality in compliance with state and federal law
regarding identity theft protection.

reducing risk from identity fraud and minimize potential damage to the
municipality from fraudulent new accounts.
   (D)   The program will help the municipality:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
(Res. 26-2008, passed 10-20-2008)
§ 37.62 SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers and other workers at the municipality, including
all personnel affiliated with third parties.

      (7)   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in
securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public Records Act and the
municipality’s open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the
sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he or she should contact his
or her supervisor. In the event that the municipality cannot resolve a conflict
between this policy and the Ohio Public Records Act, being R.C. Ch. 149, the
municipality will consult with legal counsel.
   (B)   Hard copy distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the municipality will comply with the following.
      (1)   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use.
      (2)   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
      (3)   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.

      (5)   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded they
will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical cross cut or Department of Defense (DOD)-approved shredding device.
Locked shred bins are labeled “Confidential paper shredding and recycling.”
Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in accordance with the city’s
records retention policy.
   (C)   Electronic distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the municipality will comply with the following policies.
      (1)   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved
municipal email. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an
electronic format.
      (2)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the email:
“This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and is
intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use by
others is strictly prohibited.”
(Res. 26-2008, passed 10-20-2008)
§ 37.64 ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   If the municipality maintains certain covered accounts pursuant to federal
legislation, the municipality may include the additional program details.
   (A)   Covered accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the municipality from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation or
litigation risks.
   (B)   Red flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification:
         (a)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         (b)   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         (c)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         (d)   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act, being 15 U.S.C. § 1681.
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the
history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:
         (a)   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         (b)   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         (c)   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         (d)   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (C)   Suspicious documents.
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged;
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification;
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check; and
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (D)   Suspicious personal identifying information.
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the municipality. For
example:
         (a)   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
         (b)   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is
listed on the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File; or
         (c)   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
municipality. For example, the address on an application is the same as the
address provided on a fraudulent application;
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the municipality. For example:
         (a)   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop or a
prison; or
         (b)   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
      (4)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers;
      (5)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar
to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of
other customers or other persons opening accounts;
      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete;
      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the municipality; and
      (8)   When using security questions (mother’s maiden name, pet’s name and
the like), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot
provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be
available from a wallet or consumer report.
   (E)   Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered
account.
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the municipality receives a request for new, additional or replacement
goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account;
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments;
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
         (a)   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
and
         (b)   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors);
      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer’s covered account;
      (6)   The municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements;
      (7)   The municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or
transactions in connection with a customer’s covered account;
      (8)   The municipality receives notice from customers, victims of
identity theft, law enforcement authorities or other persons regarding possible
identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the municipality;
and
      (9)   The municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Res. 26-2008, passed 10-20-2008)
§ 37.65 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (A)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
municipality from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (B)   (1)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate
actions must be taken immediately.
      (2)   Actions may include:
         (a)   Canceling the transaction;
         (b)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
         (c)   Determining the extent of liability of the municipality; and
         (d)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
(Res. 26-2008, passed 10-20-2008)
§ 37.66 PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (A)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be re-evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program
are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
   (B)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (C)   As part of the review, red flags maybe revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
   (D)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the municipality and its
customers.
(Res. 26-2008, passed 10-20-2008)
§ 37.67 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Involvement of management.
      (1)   The identity theft prevention program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   The identity theft prevention program is the responsibility of the
governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented
and maintained.
      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the
Village Administrator.
   (B)   Staff training.
      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the municipality or its customers.
      (2)   The Village Administrator is responsible for ensuring identity
theft training for all requisite employees and contractors.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
   (C)   Oversight of service provider arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the municipality to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.

VILLAGE ETHICS POLICY
§ 38.15 POLICY STATEMENT.
   It is policy of the Village Council to carry out its mission in accordance
with the strictest ethical guidelines and to ensure that village officials and
village employees conduct themselves in a manner that fosters public confidence
in the integrity of the officials and the employees of village, its processes,
and its accomplishments. (Note: where provided in this policy, “officials”
shall include both those elected and appointed.)
(Ord. 38-2014, passed 9-15-2014)
§ 38.16 GENERAL STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   Village officials and employees must, at all times, abide by
protections to the public embodied in Ohio’s ethics laws, as found in R.C.
Chapters 102 and 2921, and as interpreted by the Ohio Ethics Commission and
state courts. (A copy of these laws is provided by the Village Council, and
receipt acknowledged, as required in R.C. § 102.09(D).) Officials and employees
must conduct themselves, at all times, in a manner that avoids favoritism, bias
and the appearance of impropriety.
   (B)   (1)   A general summary of the restraints upon the conduct of all
officials and employees includes, but is not limited to, those listed below.
      (2)   No member or employee shall:
         (a)   Solicit or accept anything of value from anyone doing business
with the village;
         (b)   Solicit or accept employment from anyone doing business with the
village, unless the official or employee completely withdraws from the village
activity regarding the party offering employment, and the Council of the
village approves the withdrawal;
         (c)   Use his or her public position to obtain benefits for the
official or employee, a family member or anyone with whom the official or

services to, any state agency other than the village, unless the member or
employee first discloses the services or sales and withdraws from matters
before the Council of the village that directly affect officials and employees
of the other state agency, as directed in R.C. § 102.04;
         (f)   Hold or benefit from a contract with, authorized by, or approved
by, the village, (the Ethics Law does except some limited stockholdings, and
some contracts objectively shown as the lowest cost services, where all
criteria under R.C. § 2921.42 are met);
         (g)   Vote, authorize, recommend or in any other way use his or her
position to secure approval of a village contract (including employment or
personal services) in which the official or employee, a family member, or
anyone with whom the official or employee has a business or employment
relationship, has an interest;
         (h)   Solicit or accept honoraria (see R.C. §§ 102.01(H) and 102.03
(H));
         (I)   During public service, and for one year after leaving public
service, represent any person, in any fashion, before any public agency, with
respect to a matter in which the official or employee personally participated
while serving with the village;
         (j)   Use or disclose confidential information protected by law,
unless appropriately authorized; or use, or authorize the use of, his or her
title, the name “Village of Brewster,” in a manner that suggests impropriety,
favoritism or bias by the village or the official or employee;
   (C)   For purposes of this policy:
      ANYTHING OF VALUE. Includes anything of monetary value, including, but
not limited to, money, gifts, food or beverages, social event tickets and
expenses, travel expenses, golf outings, consulting fees, compensation or
employment.
      ANYONE DOING BUSINESS WITH THE VILLAGE. Includes, but is not limited to,
any person, corporation or other party that is doing or seeking to do business
with, regulated by, or has interests before the Council of the village.
      VALUE. Worth greater than de minimis or nominal.
(Ord. 38-2014, passed 9-15-2014)
§ 38.17 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
   Every village official member or village employee required to file a
financial disclosure statement must file a complete and accurate statement with
the Ethics Commission by April 15 of each year. Any official or employee
appointed, or employed to a filing position after February 15 and required to
file a financial disclosure statement must file a statement within 90 days of
appointment or employment.
(Ord. 38-2014, passed 9-15-2014)

penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99.
   (B)   Failure of any village official or employee to abide by this ethics
policy, or to comply with the ethics law and related statutes, will result in
discipline, which may include dismissal, as well as any potential civil or
criminal sanctions under the law.

   (A)   The Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Enter the Electric Fund Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses
for the prior month into the Operating Revenue and Operating Expense columns of
the PCA spreadsheet;
      (2)   Enter the Target Operating Revenue Margin in percent for the prior
month;
      (3)   Enter the total KWH sales for the prior month into the PCA
spreadsheet; and
      (4)   The PCA for the current billing month shall be calculated as
follows:
         (a)   Net Operating Gain or (Loss) = Operating Revenues less Operating
Expenses;
         (b)   Target Operating Revenue = Operating Expenses multiplied by [one
plus the percent Target Operating Revenue Margin];
         (c)   Target Operating Revenue Excess or (Shortfall) = Target
Operating Revenue less Actual Operating Revenue; and
         (d)   PCA = - [Four Month Rolling Average of Target Operating Revenue
Excess or (Shortfall) divided by the Four Month Rolling Average of Total KWH
Sales].
   (B)   The estimated PCA shall equal $0.0256/ KWH for the first, $0.02200/KWH
for the second, and $0.0200/KWH for the third billing month after passage of
this section. Thereafter, the PCA shall be calculated based on the methodology
in division (A) above.
   (C)   (1)   The initial Target Operating Revenue Margin shall be 15%.
      (2)   The Target Operating Revenue Margin shall be adjusted from time to
time to:

§ 54.20 PRETREATMENT.
   (A)   The village shall make and enforce rules and regulations establishing
the types and characteristics of sewage, and other matters which shall be
discharged into the sanitary sewage system; the types and characteristics of
sewage admissible to the system only after pretreatment requisites for
pretreatment; and otherwise govern the discharge of sewage and other matters
into the system in the interest of safety and efficient operation of the
wastewater treatment plant. The objectives of this section are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutant into the village
wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operations of the
system, or contaminate the resulting village sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the village
wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment at the POTW, and
which will pass through the system into receiving waters of the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the system; and
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   (B)   In cases where the character of sewage or industrial wastes from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it will
damage the sewage system, or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the wastewater
plant, the village shall compel such users to dispose of such waste so as to
prevent it from entering the sewage system of the village.
   (C)   In cases where the character of sewage or industrial wastes from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises shows excessive flow
rates or a concentration of pollutants such that it imposes an unreasonable
burden upon the sewage collection, pumping or treatment work greater than
imposed by the average sewage entering the sewage system, the village may
compel such manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises to pretreat
such sewage in such manner as specified by the Administrator before discharging
it into the sewage system, require flow control or equalizations of such wastes
so as to avoid any “slug” loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the
treatment works to cover any additional costs of having the capacity for
receiving and treating such wastes.
   (D)   In addition to the minimum charge and any volume charges, any user
discharging wastewater containing BOD in excess of 200 mg/l and/or SS in excess
of 200 mg/l shall pay the village’s cost for the treatment and removal of these
wastes at the POTW. Grease and fat of excess over 0.17 mg/l will be charged the
village’s costs for the treatment and removal of this waste at the POTW. By-
pass of pretreatment equipment or pretreatment process will not be permitted.
   (E)   Other wastewater, containing acceptable waste only, delivered to the
treatment system, shall pay a fee of $2 per 1000 gallons, and shall be subject
to the high strength surcharges. To determine slug loads the 40% volume costs
calculations shall be used. All volume over the 40% flow rate for a normal
working day shall be subject to a high volume charge:
   GPD - Work Hour x 40% = GPH allowed
   (F)   In addition to the other charges, such users shall be charged costs
for each sampling and metering required for high strength surcharges,
industrial cost recovery or ascertaining pretreatment compliance. A fee shall
be charged for each sampling period in which samples are collected and
analyzed. Sampling periods shall not exceed a 24-hour day. Sampling shall be
done when it appears that violations are occurring.
   (G)   Each industrial or commercial discharger, as deemed necessary by the
Village Administrator, shall provide and operate, at their own expense, a
monitoring facility to allow inspections, sampling and flow measurement of each
sewer discharge to the POTW. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the
discharger’s premises, except where such a location would be impractical or
cause undue hardship on the discharger, the Village Administrator may concur
with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk strip,
providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such
sampling facility to allow accurate sampling or preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
discharger. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with any and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.
   (H)   The Wastewater Superintendent or appointed representative may inspect
the monitoring facilities of any industrial or commercial discharger to
determine compliance with the terms of this subchapter. The discharger shall
allow representatives of the village to enter upon the premises of the
discharger at all reasonable hours for the purpose of inspection, sampling or
examination of records. The Wastewater Superintendent or appointed
representative shall have the right to set up, on the discharger’s property,
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance,
monitoring and/or metering if operations.
   (I)   The village may, for good cause shown, suspend the wastewater
treatment service to an industrial or commercial discharger when it appears to
the village that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens an
imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of the persons or
property substantial danger to the environment, interferes with the operation
of the POTW, or violates any pretreatment limits imposed by this subchapter.
Any treatment service shall, within a reasonable period of time as determined
by the village, cease all discharge. In the event of a failure of the
discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the time
specified, the village may commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter
to compel compliance with such order. The village may reinstate wastewater

§ 70.10 THROUGH HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more state routes that are through highways intersect, and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Whenever the
Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop traffic on a
through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this section shall
be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances warrant, the
Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through highways
under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes a
stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30 days before
installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a U-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal indication
or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles
turning right or left or making a U- turn movement, shall yield the right-of-
way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; and
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a U- turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; and
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2) and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one- way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a U-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a U-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; and
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a U- turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the

flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (A)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the
intersection or junction of roadways; and
      (3)   Exercise ordinary care while proceeding through the intersection.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,

(R.C. § 4511.132)
§ 70.34 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (E)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.
(R.C. § 4511.14)

or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with R.C. §§ 4511.211 and
4511.432.
      (2)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking or device is a public

or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (B)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted

   (B)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of division (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), (A)(4)
or (A)(5) of this section has occurred, it shall be prima facie evidence that
the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the

ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.

(C)(3)(c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither
the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 4510.07 or in any other
provision of the Ohio Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or
pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of this code that is
substantially equivalent to a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, and a court
is permitted or required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or non resident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this code shall not
exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for
the violation of the provision of the Ohio Revised Code to which the provision
of this code is substantially equivalent.
(R.C. § 4510.05)
   (B)   Whenever a person is found guilty under the laws of this state or any
ordinance of any political subdivision of this state, of operating a motor
vehicle in violation of any such law or ordinance relating to reckless
operation, the trial court of any court of record, in addition to or
independent of all other penalties provided by law, may impose a class five

or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02
(A)(5).
   (C)   Suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section shall

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on
or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

limited driving privileges.
      (2)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any
public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel
or parking in this municipality in violation of any restriction of the person’s

(D) or 4507.14.
      (3)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (A)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (A)(2) of this section. The

within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111
or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in
addition to or independent of any other sentence that it imposes upon the
offender, may order the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense
for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30 days in
accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
Registrar of the termination. The Registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is guilty of

130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially

of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (D)    It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)

   (A)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic; and
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right- hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         (b)   When preparing for a left turn; or
         (c)   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in division (B)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (C)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the

         (b)   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, R.C. §
4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court shall
impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $250.
         (c)   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $500. The court
also may impose a suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial
driver's license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege for 90 days.
         (d)   Notwithstanding divisions (D)(1)(a) to (D)(1)(c) of this
section, if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation in a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with
R.C. § 4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law,
shall impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under division (D)(1)(a), (D)(1)(b), or (D)(1)(c) of this section, as
applicable.

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a

   (D)   (1)   (a)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding
for a violation of division (A)(1)(a) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist
shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this
division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would
be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under
this division (D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved
by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN- PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.02, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §
105.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered
a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in the violation
and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer
administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing standards for
any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in
effect at the time the tests were administered, including but not limited to
any testing standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (D)(4)(b)1. or (D)(4)(b)2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
   (E)   (1)   Subject to division (E)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (A)(1)(b),
(A)(1)(c), (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), (A)(1)(g), (A)(1)(h), (A)(1)(i), or
(A)(1)(j) or (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3), or (B)(4) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions,
a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         (a)   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         (b)   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties; and
         (d)   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (F)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,

driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §

imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (G)

suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident operating
privilege form the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited

130.99(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender's operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (B) of this section.
   (I)   (1)   No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment

      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.
   (J)   If a person whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or R.C. §
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (K)   Division (A)(1)(j) of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.

metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (A)(1)(j) of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the
same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (M)   All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of the
same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined in R.C.

required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or refusing
to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person the form
described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take a chemical
test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to ensure
that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood or blood

blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to

municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form to
the person:
      You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath
or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement officer
asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section to
submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath
or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer shall do all
of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change; and
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised

state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use

trees, branches and shrubs so trimmed and cut so to provide clear site distance

      (1)   The village shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and
remove trees, plants and shrubs within the lines of all streets, alleys,

any tree or part thereof which is in an unsafe condition or which by reason of

§ 97.02 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of the
use or occupation of all rights-of-way in the village, the issuance of right-
of-way permits to persons for such use or occupancy, and to set forth the
policies of the village related thereto.
   (B)   A right-of-way occupancy permit issued pursuant to this chapter does
not take the place of any franchise, license, or permit which may be
additionally required by law, including any required by village ordinance. A
right-of-way occupancy permit issued pursuant to this chapter also does not
grant pole attachment rights or preclude the need to enter into a public and/or
private pole attachment agreements. Each permittee shall obtain any and all
such additional state, federal or village franchises, licenses or permits
necessary to the operation and conduct of its business or the occupation or use
of any right-of-way; provided, however, that no permittee holding a valid
right-of-way permit shall be required to obtain a franchise for any type of
services rendered by said permittee for which the village did not require a
franchise at the time said permittee's permit was last issued or renewed.
Should there be a direct conflict between the provisions of this chapter and a
valid franchise, the provisions of the franchise shall prevail; provided,
however, that additional obligations shall not be construed as a conflict.
   (C)   The Village Administrator, or designee, is hereby directed and
empowered to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   The village's policy regarding rights-of-way is:
      (1)   To promote the utilization of rights-of-way for the public health,
safety and welfare and to promote economic development in the village;
      (2)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
telecommunication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technologies and innovative services to the village's residents and taxpayers
at reasonable costs;
      (3)   To promote cooperation among the permittees and the village in the
occupation of rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during right-of-way work, and eliminate wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (4)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (5)   To ensure adequate public reimbursement of costs the village has
incurred for private use of the rights-of-way, including the regulation
thereof;
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
rights-of-way, and when all requests for right-of-way use cannot be
accomplished, to give priority for use of rights-of-way, in the order
indicated, from highest to lowest, to the following users:
         (a)   The village for governmental purposes;
         (b)   Another governmental entity for governmental purposes with the
village's concurrence, or other governmental use required by law;
         (c)   General right-of-way occupancy permittees and proprietary uses
by the village;
      (7)   To assure that applicants have the financial, technical and
managerial resources to comply with this chapter and the provisions of any
right-of-way occupancy permit issued hereunder; for purposes of this chapter,
an applicant possessing valid certification from the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, including certification pursuant to R.C. §§ 4933.81 et
seq., and is recognized on the rolls of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
as a regulated utility or of a cable operator possessing a valid franchise
awarded pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, for the
services to be provided by the facilities subject to this chapter shall be
presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial
resources.
      (8)   To ensure that access to and occupancy or use of the public right-
of-way advances the state of Ohio policies specified in R.C. §§
4927.02, 4928.02, and 4929.02.
      (9)   To expedite the installation and operation of micro and smaller
wireless facilities in order to facilitate the deployment of advanced wireless
service throughout the state of Ohio.
   (E)   All right-of-way occupancy permits granted hereunder shall be non-
exclusive and no property right of any nature shall be created by the granting
of a permit under this chapter.
   (F)   This chapter does not apply, and nothing herein should be construed to
apply the provisions of this chapter, to structures or facilities owned or
operated by the village or any village operations that occupy or use the
rights-of-way. It is specifically contemplated, however, that all village
departments or divisions that utilize the rights-of-way shall carry out their
operations in a manner consistent with the policy set forth in this chapter,
including participation and cooperation in all joint planning hereunder and
identification of structures and facilities located in the rights-of-way.

Codified Ordinances, each person who occupies, uses or seeks to occupy or use
the right-of-way to use, occupy, construct, own or operate structures or
facilities located in, under or over the right-of-way or any public property
with the village, shall apply for and obtain a right-of-way occupancy permit
pursuant to
Chapter 97. Any person owning, operating or maintaining structures or
facilities in the right-of-way without a right-of-way occupancy permit,
including persons operating under a permit, license or franchise issued by the
village prior to the effective date of
Chapter 97 shall apply for and obtain a right-of-way occupancy permit from the
village, unless exempted by
Chapter 97. Application will consist of providing the information set forth in
Chapter 97 and as reasonably required by the Village Administrator.
   (B)   Permits shall not be required for the following uses:
      (1)   Carts;
      (2)   Landscaping (may require a right-of-way work permit per
Chapter 97);
      (3)   Right angle signs and sidewalk signs;
      (4)   Awnings; and

         (b)   Is not inconsistent with policy of the village;
         (c)   Does not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare;
and
         (d)   Does not materially interfere with the other lawful use of the
right-of-way. The Village Administrator shall adopt regulations controlling and
further defining residential purposes and to otherwise implement the
determinations to be made under this section. Such regulations shall, among
other matters, specify that the owner of facilities that hold title to such
facilities solely as a result of a leaseback, defined as the sale or transfer
of property by a permittee to another person contemporaneously followed by the
leasing of the property to the permittee on a long-term basis, that are not
operated or controlled by said lessor, and are operated or controlled by the
permittee, are not considered to be using, occupying, owning or operating such
facilities, for purposes of this chapter, solely as a result of such leaseback.
   (C)   The following types of right-of-way occupancy permits are available:
      (1)   General right-of-way occupancy permit: a right-of-way occupancy
permit granted to persons who desire and are granted authority to utilize
rights-of-way generally for business purposes, including the provision of
utility, cable television, telecommunications or other services to the village,
its residents and taxpayers;
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to preclude the village
from requiring any person offering any natural gas, electric, cable television,
telecommunications or other utility services for which the village may lawfully
require a franchise, to acquire a franchise upon the expiration of any right-
of-way occupancy permit issued hereunder.
   (D)   Any such right-of-way occupancy permit may also allow the use of
specified public property for the uses set forth in the right-of-way occupancy
permit and in this chapter.
   (E)   Each right-of-way occupancy permit shall specify the use or uses for
which it is granted and contain such other non-discriminatory terms and
conditions as are appropriate and as are set forth in the regulations.
   (F)   Unless otherwise set forth herein, right-of-way occupancy permits or
the rights of a permittee thereunder are not transferable without the prior
express written approval of the Village Administrator, upon written request.
Such request shall contain evidence that the proposed transferee has the
financial, technical and managerial resources to comply with the obligations of
this chapter and its right-of-way occupancy permit and shall be granted if such
transferee has such resources. In making said determination, a proposed
transferee shall be presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and
managerial resources if said transferee possesses a valid certification from
the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, including certification pursuant to
R.C. §§ 4933.81, et seq., and is recognized on the rolls of the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio as a regulated utility or of a cable operator
possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the Cable Communications
Policy Act of 1984, for the services to be provided by the facilities subject
to this chapter. The Village Administrator shall adopt regulations providing
procedures for transfer of right-of-way occupancy permits that shall include
provisions providing that:
      (1)   All requests for transfer shall be deemed approved if the Village
Administrator does not disapprove the same within 30 days of receipt of the
completed written transfer request; and
      (2)   Transfer to affiliates under common ownership and control with the
permittee shall not require approval, so long as the Village Administrator is
provided 30 days written notice of such transfer.
   (G)   Any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which
a right-of-way occupancy permit has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a
nuisance and an unauthorized use of the right-of-way. The village may exercise
any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited
to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or non-
complying portion of such facility; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (H)   The Village Administrator shall adopt regulations controlling and
further defining residential purposes and to otherwise implement the
determinations to be made under this section. Such regulations shall, among
other matters, specify:
      (1)   That the owner of facilities that hold title to such facilities
solely as a result of a leaseback, defined as the sale or transfer of property
by a permittee to another person contemporaneously followed by the leasing of
the property to the permittee on a long-term basis; and
      (2)   Are operated or controlled by the permittee, are not considered to
be using, occupying, owing or operating such facilities, for purposes of this
chapter, solely as a result of such leaseback.

(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.05 CRITERIA FOR GRANTING PERMITS.
   (A)   A general right-of-way occupancy permit shall be granted to an
applicant upon a determination that:
      (1)   The granting of the right-of-way occupancy permit will contribute
to the public health, safety or welfare in the village;
      (2)   The granting of the right-of-way occupancy permit will be
consistent with the policy of the village as set forth in §
97.02(D);
      (3)   The applicant is not delinquent on any right-of-way permit fees, or
costs owed the village for right-of-way related activity and, except in the
case of entities subject to the jurisdiction and recognized on the rolls of the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio as a regulated utility or of a Cable
Operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, has the
requisite financial, managerial and technical ability to fulfill all its
obligations hereunder;
   (B)   A right-of-way occupancy permit shall not convey equitable or legal
title in the right-of-way. A right-of-way occupancy permit is only the
nonexclusive, limited right to occupy right-of-way in the village, for the
limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the right-of-way
occupancy permit and in accordance with
Chapter 97 of the Code. The rights to occupy the right-of-way may not be
subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more permittees may
collocate facilities in the same area of the right-of-way so long as each such
person complies with the provisions of
Chapter 97. Collocating permittees may file a joint application for a
construction permit. A right-of-way occupancy permit does not excuse a
permittee from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements
before collocating its facilities on facilities of others, including the
village's facilities. A right-of-way occupancy permit does not excuse a
permittee from complying with any provisions of the Code or other applicable
law.
   (C)   The Village Administrator may impose such lawful conditions on the
granting of a permit as reasonably required to be consistent with the criteria
set forth in this section and to promote the policy of the village set forth in
§
97.02(D).
(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.06 OBLIGATIONS OF PERMITTEES; CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (A)   In addition to the other requirements set forth herein and in the
regulations each permittee, except for residential purposes, shall:
      (1)   Use its best efforts to cooperate with other permittees and the
village for the best, most efficient, and least obtrusive use of rights-of-way,
consistent with safety, and to minimize traffic and other disruptions,
including street cuts;
      (2)   Have a copy of the permit and associated plans on the job site at
all times;
      (3)   Participate in such joint planning, construction and advance
notification of right-of-way work, excepting such work performed in an
emergency, provided the permittee uses its best efforts to contact the village
at the earliest possible time after beginning any such emergency work requiring
excavation or other interference with the flow of traffic, as may be required
by
Chapter 97 and this chapter and as may be more specifically set forth in
regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter, and provided further, that
mandatory joint planning shall not require the exchange or provision of trade
secrets or competitively sensitive materials or information;
      (4)   Reasonably cooperate with other permittees in the utilization of,
construction in and occupancy of private rights-of-way within the village, but
only to the extent the same is consistent with the grant thereof, is not
additionally burdensome to any property owner or unreasonably burdensome to the
permittee;
      (5)   Upon reasonable written notice of not less than 60 days, except in
an emergency threatening the public health, safety or welfare, and at the
direction of the Village Administrator, and at the permittee's sole cost, to
the extent permitted by Ohio law, promptly remove or rearrange facilities as
necessary, as further specified in the regulations:
         (a)   During any construction, repair or modification of any street,
sidewalk, village utility or other public improvement;
         (b)   As part of the Village Administrator's determination, to the
extent permitted by Ohio law, that designated portions of its rights-of-way
should accommodate only underground facilities or that facilities should occupy
only one side of a street or other public way, provided that such determination
is reasonable and a part of an overall improvement plan or project;
         (c)   If an additional or subsequent village or other public use of
rights-of-way is inconsistent with the then-current uses of such permittee; or
         (d)   For any other reasonable cause as determined by the Village
Administrator pursuant to §
97.14(B) to the extent permitted by Ohio law; however, nothing in this division
shall be interpreted as foreclosing any rights that any permittee has pursuant
to R.C. Title 49 to file an application with the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio under any applicable provision of R.C. Title 49, in order to recover the
costs associated with the relocation of any facilities pursuant to this
division;
      (6)   Provide information relating to a permittee's facilities and
operations within the rights-of-way in such form as to allow for the accurate
assessment of the quantity of a utility's infrastructure in the public rights-
of-way; for a right-of-way work permit, permittee shall provide a detailed
plan, as delineated in
Chapter 97, of the proposed work. Upon a proper request by a permittee
demonstrating that any portion of the information required constitutes a “trade
secret” pursuant to Ohio law, or that the material should remain confidential
pursuant to any other provision of local, state, or federal law, the material
shall be treated as confidential and not subject to public disclosure. In no
event will the village allow any person involved with the village's
telecommunications service access to information a permittee has designated
“confidential” or “proprietary”;
      (7)   Perform all work, construction, maintenance or removal of

appropriate safety codes and in accordance with the regulations and use its
best efforts to repair and replace any street, curb or other portion of the
rights-of-way within the disturbed area of the work area, or facilities or
structure located therein, to a condition to be determined by the Village
Administrator to be adequate under current standards, on file with the Village
Engineer, and not less than materially equivalent to its condition prior to
such work and to do so in a manner which minimizes any inconvenience to the
public, the village and other permittees, all in accordance with the
regulations adopted hereunder or under
Chapter 97. Each occupant of the right-of-way that may make a street cut shall
file with the village standards for repair of street cuts that shall be
approved or denied by the Village Engineer within 60 days after filing. If the
street cut standards are denied the right-of-way, the occupant must amend its
proposed standards to meet the village's requirements prior to making any
street cuts. Each right-of-way applicant shall amend its street cut standards
from time to time as required by good engineering practice. If a street cut
repair fails, the right-of-way occupant responsible for the street cut shall
repair the street cut until such time as the village repaves the streets. No
right-of-way occupant shall be responsible to repair a street cut damaged by a
cause other than the repair made by the right-of-way occupant;

§ 97.07 PERMIT FEES AND AUDITING.
   (A)   Any cable television provider that has a valid franchise to operate a
cable television system within the village shall not be liable for any
additional right-of-way occupancy permit fees over and above any cable
television franchise fees specified in its cable television franchise for uses
of rights-of-way directly related to the uses for which such cable television
provider holds a cable franchise, so long as the amount of such fees due in
each quarter is equal to or greater than the amounts otherwise due the village
pursuant to division (B) of this section. If the amount due under division (B)
of this section is more than said cable franchise fees, then the cable
television provider shall receive a credit in each quarter against such amount
for all such fees paid in such quarter, and shall pay the balance to the
village as set forth in division (B) of this section.
      (1)   In addition to any fees charged pursuant to
Chapter 97, all general right-of-way occupancy permittees shall pay an annual
fee, for each calendar year, as compensation for the village's cost to manage,
administer and control the right-of-way and maintain each general right-of-way
occupancy permit. Every permittee shall pay to the village general occupancy
right-of-way fees beginning January 1, 2017. Fees shall be determined and
assessed to permittees and other persons using and occupying the rights-of-way
in accordance with the following process and formula:
         (a)   The village by January 31 of each year shall calculate all
actual and incurred costs associated with rights-of-way management,
administration and control for the previous calendar year that the village
incurred and was not able to reasonably recover through permit fees or other
recovery mechanisms for each permittee.
         (b)   The village shall invoice each permittee based on the actual
costs incurred by the village for right-of-way management for that permittee
per division (A)(1)(a) of this section. This shall be the permittee's then-
current general right-of-way occupancy permit fee.
         (c)   Registration fees shall be invoiced to permittees on or about
February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due 30 days following receipt.
         (d)   To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing
authorities on the use of village property as a result of a permittee's use or
occupation of the rights-of-way, the permittee shall be responsible for payment
of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable
pursuant to this chapter and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu
of the right-of-way permit fees.
      (2)   All right-of-way related fees collected through this chapter and
Chapter 97 shall be deposited in a separate fund to be utilized for the offset
of municipal costs associated with the management and control of the public
right-of-way.
   (B)   All fees pursuant to this chapter shall be paid by check, money order
or wire transfer to the Village of Brewster, Ohio.
   (C)   Each general right-of-way occupancy permittee shall maintain books,
records, maps, documents and other evidence directly pertinent to its
calculation of payments to the village. The Village Administrator, the Village
Auditor or either's designated agents shall have reasonable access to any
books, records, maps, documents and other evidence for inspection, copying and
audit relative to the quantity of infrastructure in the public right-of-way to
the extent necessary to assure that the payments hereunder are accurate and
that all right-of-way occupancy permittees fully comply with the provisions of
this chapter and their respective right-of-way permits. Upon a proper request
by a permittee demonstrating that any portion of the information required
constitutes a trade secret pursuant to R.C. §§ 133.61 through 133.69, or shall
remain confidential pursuant to any local, state, or federal law or regulation,
the material shall be treated as confidential and not subject to public
disclosure.

criteria and schedule set forth in R.C. Chapter 4939.
   (C)   Additionally, the village will also review any request to attach any
micro wireless facilities to a municipal electric utility pole and shall grant
such requests only if the attachment to a municipal electric utility pole
serves the public health, welfare and safety. The village shall deny all
requests to attach micro wireless facilities to municipal electric utility
poles if such attachment would not serve to further the public health and
welfare, would create a safety problem, or would interfere with the conduct of
any municipal operation.
   (D)   Where not in direct conflict with R.C. Chapter 4939, the application
procedure, permit fees, and auditing procedures outlined in this
Chapter 97 shall be applicable to applications to establish micro wireless
facilities. Each individual micro wireless facility will require a separate
right-of-way occupancy permit.
   (E)   Any request for a ROW occupancy permit for a micro wireless facility
will comply with the village’s design guidelines as set forth in
Chapter 97 and meet the requirements for design or concealment measures in an
Historic District on Wabash Avenue between the Rail Underpass and Fourth
Street.
   (F)   No micro wireless facility may be placed above ground in the right-of-
way in the village’s designated undergrounding area which is Wabash Street from
7th Street South to the underpass and all parks, where above ground facilities
do not exist.

§ 97.09 JOINT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION.
   In order to promote the purposes of this chapter and the policy set forth
herein, the Village Administrator shall adopt regulations requiring and
governing joint planning and construction for all right-of-way occupancy
permittees. Such regulations shall not, however, require a permittee to divulge
trade secrets or other competitively sensitive confidential information,
release of which would cause material injury to the permittee. Such regulations
shall also require any confidential information of a permittee in the
possession of the village be treated as such, to the extent such information
does not legally constitute a public record.
(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.10 CONSTRUCTION PERMITS.

of-way, the applicant shall provide:
            1.   Credible evidence, if specifically requested by the Village
Administrator, satisfactory to the village that there is no excess capacity of
the village on existing poles or in existing underground systems;
            2.   Credible evidence to the village that it is not financially
and/or technically practicable for the applicant to make an underground
installation or locate its facilities on existing poles;
            3.   The location, size, height, color, and material of the
proposed poles; and
            4.   Credible evidence satisfactory to the village that the
applicant will adhere to all the applicable laws concerning the installation of
new poles.
         (g)   If applicant is proposing an underground installation in
existing ducts or conduits within the right-of-way, the applicant shall provide
credible information satisfactory to the village to sufficiently detail and
identify:
            1.   Based on the existing facilities, the excess capacity village
has for like or similar facilities currently available in such ducts or
conduits before installation of applicant's facilities; and
            2.   Based on existing facilities, the excess capacity village for
like or similar facilities that will exist in such ducts or conduits after
installation of applicant's facilities.
         (h)   If applicant is proposing an underground installation within new
ducts or conduits to be constructed within the right-of-way, the applicant must
provide credible information satisfactory to the village to sufficiently detail
and identify:

         (j)   Payment of all money due to the village for:
            1.   Permit fees;
            2.   Any loss, damage, or expense suffered by the village as a
result of applicant's prior construction in the right-of-way or any emergency
actions taken by the village;
            3.   Any right-of-way occupancy permit issued to the applicant/
person whose facilities are being constructed; and
            4.   Any other money due to the village from the applicant/person
whose facilities are being constructed.
         (k)   In addition to the above requirements, applicant must comply
with all applicable construction guidelines.
         (l)   When a construction permit is requested for purposes of
installing additional facilities or any part of a facility, the posting of a
Construction Bond and Removal Bond, acceptable to the village and subject to
Chapter 97, for the additional facilities or any part of a facility is
required.
         (m)   Upon request, the Village Administrator may modify or waive the
information requirements if they are not necessary in evaluating the
construction permit application. The Village Administrator may request
applicable and pertinent additional information if it is necessary in
evaluating the construction permit application.
   (C)   Issuance of permit; conditions. If the Village determines that the
applicant has satisfied the requirements of
Chapter 97 and the construction permit process, the Director of Public Works
shall issue a construction permit subject to the provisions of this §
97.10(C)(2). The village may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of
the construction permit and the performance of the permittee thereunder in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the
structural integrity of the right-of-way, to protect the property and safety of
other users of the right-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (D)   Construction permit fees.
      (1)   The village shall annually calculate construction permit fees and
appropriately revise any prior year's construction permit fees based upon the
formula and calculations described in this §
97.15(D). Construction permit fees shall remain in effect until the village's
next annual modification of the construction permit fees.
      (2)   The village, on or about January 1st of each year, shall calculate
all the actual and incurred construction permit issuance, inspection,
oversight, enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year
including the value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
right-of-way that will result from construction that takes place therein.
"degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
section means the accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way caused by
construction in or disturbance of the right-of-way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such right-of-way earlier than would be required if the
construction did not occur.
      (3)   The village, on or about January 1st of each year; shall total all
the construction permit fee receipts received in accordance with the scheduled
fees required by the prior year's construction permit fees for the previous
calendar year.
      (4)   The village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in §
97.10(D)(2) herein, by the total construction permit fees received as
referenced in §
97.10(D)(3) herein, to arrive at a numerical factor representing the previous
year’s cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)   The village shall multiply the then currently codified construction
permit fees by the numerical factor as referenced in §
97.15(D)(4) herein, to calculate revised permit fees for the new calendar year.
      (6)   The village shall act, on or about January 31st of each year, in
accordance with the results of §
97.15(D)(5), to codify new annual permit fees by separate legislation enacted
by Council by appropriately increasing or decreasing the previous year’s permit
fees. Revised permit fees shall be effective upon passage. Any permit requests
pending on the date of any annual permit fee modification shall be subject to
all new permit fees as modified.
      (7)   Except as provided in subsection §
97.15(D)(8) herein, no construction permit shall be issued without payment of
construction permit fees except to the village (exclusive of its enterprise
fund agencies which shall be required to obtain construction permits) which
shall be exempt. Construction permit fees that were paid for a permit that the
village has revoked due to breach and in accordance with the terms of §§
97.10 or
97.13(E) are not refundable.
      (8)   The Finance Director may permit a permittee to make quarterly
payments of construction permit fees based upon the permittee’s financial
condition and past payment history. The quarterly payment shall be due and
payable within 30 days after the end of the quarter. The Finance Director may
revoke this permission due to a change in financial condition, late payment, or
other just cause.
   (E)   Joint applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
applications for construction permits to work in the right-of-way at the same
place and time. Joint applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
construction permit fees.
(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.11 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Utility engineering study required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial construction, extension, or
relocation of facilities in the right-of-way, except for repair, maintenance or
replacement with like facilities or relocations requested or caused by a third
party (excluding the village) or another permittee, a permittee shall conduct a
utility engineering study on the proposed route of construction expansion or
relocation unless the Village Administrator issues a written exception. Where
such construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party,
every permittee located within the right-of-way at issue or involved with the
work shall use all best efforts to cooperate and assist any other permittee or
person who is directed by the village to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         (a)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
         (b)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         (c)   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the applicant or person on whose behalf the permit was
applied for owns or controls in the right-of-way along the proposed route. Upon
request of the Village Administrator, a permittee shall also record and
identify the general location of all other facilities in the right-of-way along
the proposed route. For the purposes of this section, general location shall
mean the alignment of other facilities in the right-of-way, but shall not
necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the right-of-way.
         (d)   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in §
97.11(A)(l)(a-c) herein, on the construction permittee's proposed route maps
and construction plans.
         (e)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with §
97.11(A)(1)(d), permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Village Administrator, a permittee
shall not excavate more than a three feet by three feet square hole in the
right-of-way to complete this task.
         (f)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed design to avoid the need to
relocate other underground facilities.
      (2)   The Village Administrator may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed construction plans.
   (B)   Copy to village. Upon completion of the tasks described in §
97.11(A) above, the construction permittee shall submit, if necessary labeled
in accordance with the requirements of R.C. § 1020.06(B), the proposed route
maps and construction plans, with the results of the utility engineering study,
in the most advanced format (including, but not limited to electronic and/or
digital format) then currently being used by the permittee that the village is
capable of reading (or readily converting to a readable form). The mapping data
is only required to be at the "Atlas" level of detail necessary for the village
to reasonably determine the location of the permittee’s facilities in the
right-of-way. The permittee shall supply the mapping data on paper if the
Village Administrator determines that the format currently being used by the
permittee is not capable of being read by the village.
   (C)   Qualified firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the permittee if in the discretion of the
Village Administrator the construction permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself. Alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering that is approved by the village.
   (D)   Cost of study. The permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with §
97.11(A)-(C).
   (E)   Construction schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in
Chapter 97 or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Village Administrator
waives any of the requirements of this section due to unique or unusual
circumstances, a permittee shall be required to submit a written construction
schedule to the village five working days before commencing any work in or
about the right-of-way, and shall further notify the village not less than one
working day in advance of any excavation in the right-of-way. This section
shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under §
97.13(D)(1) (emergency situations) and §
97.12 (minor maintenance) herein.
   (F)   Location of facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the village's Rules and Regulations.
      (2)   The village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, future
village and county plans for public improvements, development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among permittees.
   (G)   Least disruptive technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the right-of-way. Specifically, every permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize trenchless
technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, and microtunneling. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable
installed in the subsurface right-of-way pursuant to
Chapter 97 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no
cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to
Chapter 97 using "direct bury" techniques.
   (H)   Special exceptions. The village may grant a special exception to the
requirements of §§
97.11(F) and
97.11(G) if a permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the permittee to provide services in the village.
      (3)   The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the village herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the village.
   (I)   Relocation of facilities.
      (1)   A permittee shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way
whenever the village finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation.
In instances where the village requests removal and/or relocation, the village
shall waive all applicable construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or
relocation, the permittee shall restore the right-of-way to the same or better
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are
required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be
replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In accordance with law, the
Village Administrator may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent
unreasonable interference by the permittee’s facilities with:
         (a)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the village;
         (b)   The public health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to
prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over
the right-of-way; or
         (c)   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a right-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a permittee who has facilities in
the right-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for
the purposes of the village, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with R.C. § 723.041.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the village, a permittee fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities as designated by the
village, within 30 days after the village's removal order, or if a permittee
fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair
of the right-of-way of the village, within 12 months thereafter, then, to the
extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the village shall have the right
to:
         (a)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
         (b)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the permittee
in, on, over or under the right-of-way of the village at permittee’s cost and
expense, by another person; however, the village shall have no liability for
any damage caused by such action and the permittee shall be liable to the
village for all reasonable costs incurred by the village in such action; and
         (c)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
permittee’s facilities in, on, over or under the right-of-way of the village
designated by the village for removal and not timely removed by the permittee
shall belong to and become the property of the village without payment to the
permittee, and the permittee shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
village shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the village, to
evidence such ownership by the village.
   (J)   Pre-excavation facilities location. Before the start date of any
right-of-way excavation, each permittee who has facilities located in the area
to be excavated shall, to the best of its ability, mark the horizontal and
approximate vertical placement of all its facilities. All permittees shall also
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to
establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.
   (K)   Right-of-way restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
right-of-way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
Rules and Regulations. If a permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of right-of-way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the permittee shall complete the restoration of the right-of-way as soon as
weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify
the village.
      (2)   In approving an application for a construction permit, the village
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or
alternatively to restore the right-of-way itself if the permittee has in the
past not abided by requirements of
Chapter 97.
      (3)   If the village allows a permittee to restore the right-of-way, the
permittee may at the time of application for a construction permit be required
to post a construction bond in an amount determined by the village to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the right-of-way to its approximate
pre-excavation condition. If, 12 months after completion of the restoration of
the right-of-way, the village determines that the right-of-way have been
properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the village. The village shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
village in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the right-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the
right-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
the pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining life-expectancy
of the right-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the relative cost of
the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the
prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would
otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-
way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise
take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited to,
patching the affected area, replacement of the right-of-way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the right-of-way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the right-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its completion. During this
12 month period, it shall, upon notification from the Village Administrator,
correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required
by the Village Administrator. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed
within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Village
Administrator, unless otherwise extended by the Village Administrator.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the village or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the village, the village, at its
option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the
village, within 30 days of billing, the restoration cost of restoring the
right-of-way and any other costs incurred by the village. Upon failure to pay,
the village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/
or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the village and/ or another
permittee(s), then the Village Administrator may reasonably apportion the
restoration responsibility among the village, permittees and/or other persons.
   (L)   Damage to other facilities.
      (1)   Each permittee shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
village-owned facilities in the right-of-way which the permittee or its
facilities damage.
      (2)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the permittee seeking a timely response, when the village
performs work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary, as may be allowed by
law, to maintain, support, or move a permittee’s facilities to protect those
facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that permittee and
shall be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the
village may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a permittee
does not pay or the village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted
by the permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies. Each
permittee shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another permittee caused during the village's response to an
emergency occasioned by that permittee’s facilities.
   (M)   Right-of-way vacation. If the village sells or otherwise transfers a
right-of-way which contains the facilities of a permittee, such sale or
transfer shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements
required pursuant to R.C. § 723.041.
   (N)   Installation requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Village Administrator.
   (O)   Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall notify the Village Administrator.
      (1)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the terms and
conditions of the permit and/or
Chapter 97.
      (3)   The Inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee at
pursuant to §
97.28(D). An order may be appealed to the Village Administrator. The decision
of the Village Administrator may be appealed to the Village Administrator whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the
order, the permittee shall present proof to the Village Administrator that the
violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the
required time, the Village Administrator may revoke the permit pursuant to §
97.13(E).
   (P)   Other obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in §
97.13(D)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a right-of-way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Village Administrator may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (Q)   Undergrounding required. Where not otherwise required to be placed
underground by
Chapter 97, a permittee shall locate facilities underground at the request of
an adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of facilities
underground is consistent with the permittee’s normal construction and
operating standards, and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over
the normal aerial or above ground placement costs of identical facilities are
home directly by the property owner making the request. A permittee, under any
circumstance shall, upon the reasonable request of the village, always use best
efforts to place facilities underground. Where technically possible and not
economically unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and
facilities installed), all facilities to be installed by a permittee under the
right-of-way shall be installed in conduit.
(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.12 MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMIT.
   (A)   Right-of-way minor maintenance permit requirement. No person shall
perform minor maintenance of facilities in the right-of-way without first
having obtained a right-of-way minor maintenance permit as set forth in this
chapter. Minor maintenance means: (i) the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction and not requiring
traffic control for more than two hours at any one location; (ii) the routine
repair or replacement of facilities with like facilities not involving
construction and taking place on thoroughfares and arteries between the hours
of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.; (iii) the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction on all right-of-
ways, other than thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic and
is for a period of less than eight contiguous hours; (iv) construction other
than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes less than eight contiguous hours
to complete, does not impede traffic and does not involve a pavement cut; (v)
minor and/or non-material vegetation management/tree pruning. The Village
Administrator may adopt Rules and Regulations pursuant to §
97.18 that clarify the definition of minor maintenance and/or provide a process
for a permittee to determine whether particular activity constitutes minor
maintenance.
      (1)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit allows the right-of-way
minor maintenance permittee to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the
right-of-way as required.
      (2)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit is valid from the date of
issuance until revoked by the Village Administrator.
      (3)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit must be displayed or upon
request produced within 12 business hours.
      (4)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Village Administrator.
   (B)   Right-of-way minor maintenance permit applications. Application for a
right-of-way minor maintenance permit shall be made to the Village
Administrator. In addition to any information required by the Village
Administrator, all right-of-way minor maintenance permit applications shall
contain, and will only be considered complete upon compliance with the
following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the applicant has obtained a right-of-way
occupancy permit or proof that the applicant has written authority to apply for
a right-of-way minor maintenance permit on behalf of a party that has been
issued a right-of-way occupancy permit.
      (2)   Submission of a completed right-of-way minor maintenance permit
application in the form required by the Village Administrator.
      (3)   A statement that the applicant will employ protective measures and
devices that, consistent with the OMUTCD, will prevent injury or damage to
persons or property and to minimize disruptions to the efficient movement of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (C)   Issuance of right-of-way minor maintenance permits; conditions.
      (1)   If the Village Administrator determines that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this chapter and the right-of-way minor
maintenance permit process, the Village Administrator shall issue a right-of-
way minor maintenance permit subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The village may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to the
Rules and Regulations enacted by the Village Administrator, upon the issuance
of the right-of-way minor maintenance permit and the performance of the right-
of-way minor maintenance permittee thereunder in order to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the right-
of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the right-of-way,
and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (D)   Right-of-way minor maintenance permit fees. The Village Administrator
shall not charge a fee for the issuance of the right-of-way minor maintenance
permit but may revoke the right-of-way minor maintenance permit as any other
permit may be revoked under this chapter.
(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.13 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (A)   Mandatory denial of permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application;
      (2)   To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the village unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the Village
Finance Director and the Law Director;
      (3)   To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Village Administrator, the issuance of
a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Village Administrator, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the right-of-way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Permissive denial of permit. The Village Administrator may deny a
permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-
of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its users.
      (1)   The Village Administrator, in his/her discretion, may consider one
or more of the following factors:
         (a)   The extent to which right-of-way space where the permit is
sought is available;
         (b)   The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-
way;
         (c)   The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in
another right-of-way for the proposed facilities;
         (d)   The applicability of
Chapter 97 or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect location of
facilities in the right-of-way;
         (e)   The degree of compliance of the permittee with the terms and
conditions of its right-of-way occupancy permit,
Chapter 97, and other applicable ordinances and regulations;
         (f)   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way;
         (g)   The condition and age of the right-of-way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction;
         (h)   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and
damage to the right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public
served by the expansion into additional parts of the right-of-way; or
         (i)   Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of
Chapter 97 or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within 24 months after construction completion or a newly
reconstructed street within 24 months of reconstruction completion, except
where:
         (a)   An emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
         (b)   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; or
         (c)   The Village Administrator determines it is in the best interests
of the village that such an open cut take place.
   (C)   Discretionary issuance of permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of §§
97.13(A)(1) and
97.13(A)(2), the Village Administrator may issue a permit in any case where the
permit is necessary;
         (a)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the
village;
         (b)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
         (c)   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (D)   Work done without a permit in emergency situations.
      (1)   Each permittee shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Village Administrator of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The permittee may proceed to take whatever
actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within five
business days, unless otherwise extended by the Village Administrator, after
the occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the
permittee shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with
Chapter 97 for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the
event that the village becomes aware of an emergency regarding a permittee’s
facilities, the village shall use best efforts to contact the permittee or the
representative of each permittee affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the village may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the permittee whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an emergency, any permittee who constructs
in, on, above, within, over, below or through a right-of-way without a. valid
permit must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said
permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with the
village the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply
with all of the requirements of
Chapter 97.
   (E)   Revocation of permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the code as a privilege
and not as a right. The village reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any law, or any provision or condition of
the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, any of the following:
         (a)   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit;
         (b)   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the village or its citizens;
         (c)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit;
         (d)   The failure to maintain the required Construction or Removal
Bonds and /or insurance;
         (e)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a right-
of-way occupancy permit;
         (f)   The failure to complete the construction in a timely manner; or
         (g)   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant
to §
97.11(03).
      (2)   If the Village Administrator determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
condition of the permit, the Village Administrator shall serve a written demand
upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon a
substantial breach, as stated above, the Village Administrator may place
additional or revised conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Village Administrator
with a plan, acceptable to the Village Administrator, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Village Administrator, or the permittee's
failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the
permit.
      (4)   If a permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will
not be allowed further permits for up to and including one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the
village for the village's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the
costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with
such revocation.
(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.14 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (A)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the county, shall deposit with the Village
Administrator an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond
in an amount determined by the Village Administrator to be appropriate based
upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction default, problem or
deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public,
the Village Administrator shall serve written notice to the construction
permittee detailing the construction default, problem or deficiency. If the
Village Administrator determines that correction or repair of the construction
default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not been substantially
initiated within ten calendar days after the date following service and
notification and detailing the construction default, problem or deficiency,
then the village may attach the letter of credit or surety bond. Upon
attachment, written notice shall be served on the construction permittee by the
Village Administrator.
   (B)   Removal bond. Upon issuance of a right-of-way occupancy permit and
continuously thereafter, and until 120 days after a permittee’s facilities have
been removed from the right-of-way, (unless the Village Administrator notifies
the permittee that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a permittee shall
deposit with the Village Administrator and maintain an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal to or greater
than $100,000, the Village Administrator shall make all reasonable efforts to
allow permittee a period of five calendar days after serving notification in
writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to the
Village Administrator attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond
regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall be
provided to the permittee by the Village Administrator.
   (C)   Blanket Bond. In lieu of the Construction Bond required by §
97.14(A) and the Removal Bond required by §
97.14(B), Permittee may deposit with the Village Administrator an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of $5,000,000.
Unless a construction default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or
endangers the safety of the general public, the Village Administrator shall
make all reasonable effort to allow permittee a period of five calendar days
after sending notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem
or deficiency prior to Village Administrator’s attachment of the letter of
credit or surety bond.
   (D)   Self bonding. In lieu of the Construction Bond required by §
97.14(A), the Removal Bond required by §
97.14(B) and the Blanket Bond required by §
97.19(C), those permittees maintaining a book value in excess of $50,000,000
may submit a statement to the Village Administrator requesting to self-bond. If
approval to self-bond is granted, a permittee shall assure the village that
such self-bonding shall provide the village with no less protection and
security than would have been afforded to the village by a third party surety
providing permittee with the types and amounts of bonds detailed in the above
named sections. This statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year;
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program; and
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Village Administrator.
   (E)   Purposes. The bonds required by this section, and any self-bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all terms, conditions
and obligations of
Chapter 97;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee or permittee’s violation of
Chapter 97 or its failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to
Chapter 97; and
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the village, including
permit fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance
required pursuant to
Chapter 97;
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the right-of-way pursuant to
Chapter 97;
      (6)   The payment to the village of any amounts for which the permittee
is liable that are not paid by its insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the village
pursuant to
Chapter 97 or the law.
   (F)   Form. The bond documents required by this section and any replacement
bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until 90 days after completion of construction of the facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least 90 days' written notice to village of surety's
intention to cancel or not renew this bond.
(Ord. 32-2018, passed 7-2-2018)
§ 97.15 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each Permittee shall, at the
time of initial application and by January 1 of each following year, file a
Construction and Major Maintenance Plan with the Director of Public Service.
Such Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall be provided for all
geographical areas requested by the Director of Public Service, up to and
including the entire geographical area of the village. It shall be submitted
using a format(s) mutually agreeable to the permittee and the village and shall
contain the information determined by the Director of Public Service to be
necessary to facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency of
construction in the right-of-way. The Construction and Major Maintenance Plan
shall include, but not be limited to all currently scheduled and/or anticipated
construction projects for the next calendar year, and if none are scheduled or
anticipated then the Plan shall so state. The permittee shall use its best
efforts in supplying this information and shall update the Construction and
Major Maintenance Plan on file with the Director of Public Service whenever
there is a material change in scheduled and/or anticipated construction
projects. In an effort to assist permittees with the completion of their annual
Construction and Major Maintenance Plan, the Director of Public Service, on or
before October 1st of each year, will send each permittee’s representative a
descriptive narrative (and any mapping information reasonably available) for
all the planned right-of-way improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the
village then currently intends to undertake during the next calendar year. The
village may, in its sole discretion, update and/or modify the descriptive
narrative and mapping information provided.
   (B)   Mapping data. With the filing of its application for a right-of-way
occupancy permit, a permittee shall be required to accurately inform the
village of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way
the permittee then currently occupies and begin submitting to the village all
information that currently exists and which can be provided regarding the
location of its facilities in the right-of-way in hard copy or in the most
advanced format (including, but not limited to, electronic and/or digital
format) then currently being used by the permittee that the village is capable
of reading or readily converting to a readable form. Unless otherwise required
by §
97.10(B), a permittee shall have up to one year from the date of the
permittee’s initial filing of an application for a right-of-way occupancy
permit to completely submit all the mapping data in the entire geographical
area of the village which it owns or over which it has control that are located
in any right-of-way of the village. The mapping data is only required to be at
the "Atlas" level of detail necessary for the village to reasonably determine
the location of the permittee’s facilities in the right-of-way. Any time after
the issuance of a right-of-way occupancy permit, and upon the reasonable
request of the Director of Public Service, a permittee shall be required to
provide to the village any additional location information for any facilities
which it owns or over which it has control that are located in any right-of-way
of the village required by the village. Any and all actual direct, incidental
and indirect costs incurred by the village during the process of reviewing,
inputting and/or converting a permittee’s mapping information to comport with
the village's then current standard format (whether electronic or otherwise)
shall be directly billed to, and must be timely remitted by, the permittee.
Failure to pay such mapping costs within 60 days of receipt of an invoice shall
subject an applicant or permittee to revocation of its right-of-way occupancy
permit and the penalties of §
97.99. Further, each permittee that has been issued a right-of-way occupancy
permit shall accurately inform the village on or before each subsequent January
1st of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the
permittee’s then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1st. The
Director of Public Service may, in the future, adopt additional specifications
and further define or modify the mapping data requirements under this section
for reasons including, but not limited to, changes in technology or the law
regarding public disclosure of a permittee’s mapping information. When the
village modifies and/or amends the mapping data requirements, the village shall
use best efforts to avoid unreasonably increasing the burden to the permittees
that may be associated with satisfying the amended mapping requirements. When
the mapping requirements of §
97.15(B) are amended, each permittee shall be served with a copy of the new
specifications or modifications by regular U.S. Mail to the representative
identified in each right-of-way occupancy permit; provided, however, that any
failure of any permittee to actually receive such notice shall not in any way
affect the validity or enforceability of said specifications or modifications.

request from a third party for the disclosure of information a provider has
clearly marked as confidential/proprietary information, the village shall
respond in accordance with R.C. Chapter 149. However, the village will endeavor
to notify the permittee of any such request prior to making the subject
document(s) available for inspection or copying, at which point it will be the

§ 97.16 COMPENSATION.
   (A)   As compensation for the village's costs to administer
Chapter 97, manage, administer and control the right-of-way and maintain each
right-of-way occupancy permit issued, every permittee shall pay to the village
a registration maintenance fee. The registration maintenance fee shall be
determined and assessed to permittees and other persons operating or otherwise
using and occupying the right-of-way in accordance with the following process
and formula:
      (1)   The village by February 28th of each year, shall calculate all
actual and incurred costs associated with right-of-way management,
administration and control for the previous calendar year that the village was
not able to reasonably recover through construction permit fees or other
recovery mechanisms provided for in
Chapter 97.
      (2)   Permittees and Applicants, as required in §
97.15(B), shall accurately inform the village upon application for a right-of-
way occupancy permit and on or before each subsequent January 1st of the number
of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the permittee’s
facilities occupied as of the immediately previous December.
      (3)   The village shall total the entire number of miles of right-of-way
reported as being used or occupied by all permittees.
      (4)   The village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in §
97.16(A)(l) by the total number of miles of right-of-way reported as being used
or occupied by all permittees as referenced in §
97.16(A)(3) to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)   The village shall then multiply each permittee’s mileage
calculation as referenced in §
97.16(A)(2) by the per-mile cost calculation referenced in §
97.16(A)(4). The product shall be a permittee’s annual registration maintenance
fee.
      (6)   The village shall perform its annual calculation of registration
maintenance fees following receipt of the permittees required December mileage
report. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to permittees on or
about March 1 of each calendar year and shall be due 30 days following receipt.
      (7)   Cable companies operating under non-exclusive cable franchises for
the purposes of providing cable service, video services permittee operating
under a VSA for the purpose of providing video services, and permittees of open
video system services, which compensate the village under other mechanisms in
an amount equal to or greater than the annual registration maintenance fee that
would normally be required for their right of way use in the village, shall
have the mileage of the right-of-way they use and/or occupy included in the
calculations described in §
97.16, but shall not be required to contribute to the recovery of right-of-way
costs as defined by
Chapter 97 with the exception of permit costs.
      (8)   The village may by separate legislation enacted by Village Council
on or about February 28th of each year, in accordance with the results of §
97.16(A)(4), enact an initial and thereafter a new annual registration
maintenance fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or decreasing the
previous year(s) registration maintenance fee (per mile). Revised registration
maintenance fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (B)   Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid each calendar year
in accordance with §
97.16(A)(6). Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in full for the first
year of the registration as a condition of the right-of-way occupancy permit
becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date of the right-
of-way occupancy permit to the end of the calendar year if less than one full
year.
   (C)   Taxes and assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by any taxing authority or community authority on the use of village
property as a result of a permittee’s use or occupation of the right-of-way,
the permittee shall be responsible for payment of such taxes or assessments.
Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to
Chapter 97 and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees
and charges listed in
Chapter 97. The registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or
other assessment except as specifically provided in
Chapter 97, or as required by applicable law.
   (D)   Interest on late payments. In the event that any registration
maintenance fee is not paid to the village by April 1, the permittee shall pay
a monthly late charge of 1% of the unpaid balance for each month or any portion
thereof for which payment is not made.
   (E)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the village of any
registration maintenance fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
village may have for additional sums payable.

§ 97.17 VILLAGE USE OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Except for traffic control facilities and facilities in place as of

agreements between the village and a permittee, or as otherwise provided by
law, the village shall not install or maintain upon any poles and within any
underground pipes or conduits or other facilities of any general right-of-way
occupancy permittee, any facilities desired by the village for the village's
use without the consent of such permittee unless:

be appealed by the right-of-way occupancy permittee to the Village
Administrator. The decision of the Village Administrator shall be final;
      (3)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.

reimburse the village for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
   (B)   Facilities of a right-of-way occupancy permittee who fail to comply
with this section and which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be

excavations of the right-of-way. If the village abates the nuisance it may take
all action necessary to recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including
but not limited to, those methods set forth in R.C. § 715.261. The village

public right-of-way, including damages to the right-of-way, whether caused by a
violation of any of the provisions of
Chapter 97 or other provisions of the Code.

administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court
of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any permit, right or any portions of this section are illegal or
unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or deemed to exist
hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right of
either party to terminate without cause upon giving 60 days written notice to
the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be
the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right or
registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the

revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must acknowledge the
authority of the village to issue such revocable permit and the power to revoke
it.

lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as
now are or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the
village, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof
by the village at any time. A permittee or permittee is deemed to acknowledge

the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws
and ordinances enacted by the village pursuant to such powers.

Village Administrator shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof
is:

considered occurred after the effective date of the Act unless the village has

negotiate with these companies.
      (2)   Exceptions may be permitted by the Service Director under such

raising or lowering of the wires shall be paid by the person requesting the
same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in
advance. The grantee shall be given not less than 72 hours’ advance notice to
arrange for such temporary wire changes.

the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title XIII or Title
XXIX of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing; and
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Means reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. Means a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. The term does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C. §
2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility; or
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for which
the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first degree,
to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a drug abuse
offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit
doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an
offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that
drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of
unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of
controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
Statutory reference:
   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01; or
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)    Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused's residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self- defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of "reasonable doubt" and "proof beyond a reasonable
doubt", contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   "Reasonable doubt" is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt" is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person’s use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality; and
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay

1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is

court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;

or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability or other factor made

general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses; and
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)    Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 through 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term
or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this
state, another state or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving
the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.20 APPREHENSION, DETENTION OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person meets
all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written; and
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained or arrested.
For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as in R.C. §
3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
§ 130.21 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Generally. Except where otherwise specifically classified within the
body of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more
than $500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender or
religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
    (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in § 130.18 or 133.99 of this code or R.C. §
2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this section and unless another term
is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a
jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days; or
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56 or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days; or
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§ 130.18 and 133.99 of this code or
R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F) or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F) or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F) or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions; or
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F) or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F) or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction; and/or
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
   (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for a
significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F) or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders; and
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family; and/or
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring

or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;

         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction; and
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the Clerk of the Court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the Clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
(G)(1)(b)2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by

sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the

               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F)
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F) or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F)
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F) or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F) or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as

described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the Court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance; or
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the
financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude, enforcement of the criminal
sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering

installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000; or
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried

of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03 or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a

services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48
or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment,

services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48 or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another as described in division (B)(1)
or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that involve
a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of
conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is not
necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in order to
prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or (B)(3) of this
section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to prove
the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the requisite
statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
FAIR MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.

definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including

render the highway, street, sidewalk, or passage impassable

highway or street, prevents an emergency service responder from responding to
an emergency, or prevents an emergency vehicle or an emergency service
responder from having access to an exit from an emergency.
      (2)   Upon receipt of a request or order from an emergency service
responder to remove or cease the obstruction, the person refuses to remove or
cease the obstruction.

of R.C. § 2921.31 or any other section of the Ohio Revised Code. Any conduct
that is a violation of division (A) of this section and that also is a
violation of R.C. § 2921.31 or any other section of the Ohio Revised Code may

or both sections.

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

shall be sold from any such plat until such plat has been approved as herein
required. The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform with the
requirement of these regulations. The subdivider shall make improvements and

interest.
      (3)   Construction plan stage. The construction plan stage requires the
subdivider to present all information needed to enable the Village
Administrator and Utility Departments to check the drainage areas and to
determine that the storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines and material for
street construction meet the requirements of all applicable standards and
regulations.
      (4)   Final plat stage. After having constructed the applicable
improvements as provided for in the construction plan, the final plat stage

necessary easements, deed covenants for maintenance and the like) to enable the
Commission to determine that the subdivision fully complies with these
regulations and conforms to the approved preliminary plan and the construction
plan.

for the proper projection and continuance of streets into adjacent,
unsubdivided acreage where it is deemed appropriate and desirable by the
Commission. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited.
      (3)   Tentative future street system. Where the plat to be submitted
includes only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may
require a sketch of a tentative future street system for the unsubdivided
portion.
   (D)   Alignment; horizontal.
      (1)   Junction offsets. No street layouts with centerline offsets of less
than 125 feet shall be permitted.
      (2)   Angle of intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect
any other street at less than 60 degrees.
   (E)   Dead-end streets.
      (1)   Permanent.
         (a)   It is suggested that permanent dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs) be
not longer than 800 feet.
         (b)   Cul-de-sacs shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-
around having a right-of-way diameter of at least 120 feet. The street right-
of-way line and turn-around right-of-way should be joined by tangent arcs of 50
feet minimum radius.
         (c)   Maintenance of cul-de-sac: property owners abutting the cul-de-
sac are responsible for the maintenance, cutting the grass, landscaping and the
like of the open area in the cul-de-sac.
      (2)   Temporary.
         (a)   Where streets are extended to the boundary of a subdivision to
provide for their continuance at such time as the adjacent land is subdivided,
they may be terminated in the same manner as required for permanent dead-end
streets.
         (b)   If a street extends only one lot depth past a street
intersection, no turn-around is required.
   (F)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except under one of the
following conditions.
      (1)   There exists a half street which should logically be continued to a
reasonable intersection.
      (2)   There exists a dedicated or platted half street adjacent to the
tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by
the Commission.

§ 152.078 LOTS.
   (a)   General. Lots shall meet all lawful requirements as adopted by the
various governmental subdivisions or public agencies having jurisdiction. The
Commission may limit to a maximum ratio of three and one-half to one the depth
to width of lots for the most efficient use of land, the width being measured
at the building setback line of such lots. The village discourages any
subdivision development without access to a sanitary sewer. However, a
subdivision with no reasonable access to a sanitary sewer shall have a lot size
of one acre unless the County Health Department requires a larger area. In non-
sewered subdivisions the plats must be approved for size by the County Health
Department. These requirements with reference to the size of lots not to be
served by a public sanitary sewer system may be varied upward or downward in
individual cases by the Commission when, in the opinion of the Commission, such
action is justified by a written report of the City or County Health
Commissioner having jurisdiction over the proposed subdivision.
   (B)   Corner lots. All corner lots shall be designed to permit the minimum
40-foot front yard setback on each street, or other setback as required by the
Zoning Code. Available building space not to be less than the other lots in the

provide each lot with frontage on a public street unless otherwise allowed by
the Commission and to provide driveway and parking space on each lot.
   (D)   Double or reverse frontage. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots
may be allowed where they are essential to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least 20 feet,
across which there would be no right of access, should be provided along the
line of lots abutting such traffic artery.
   (E)   Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be a minimum of ten feet on each
side and substantially at right angles or radial to street lines.
   (F)   Building setback lines. Building setback lines shall be 35 feet, or as
required by the Zoning Code.
   (G)   Public places. Playgrounds, parks or other public open spaces may be
required by Council to the extent of 3% of the platted area of the subdivision.

(Ord. 09-2001, § 116.85, passed 3-5-2001)
§ 152.093 MISCELLANEOUS ENGINEERING DETAILS.
   (A)   Drainage.
      (1)   Purpose. These design standards and specifications shall serve as
minimum requirements for the handling of surface water and drainage. These
procedures and regulations shall govern the development of all new and/or
modified drainage systems. The development of such drainage systems shall
include the conveyance of surface water to an adequate outlet which is capable
of carrying the flow.
      (2)   Preliminary drainage plan. A preliminary drainage plan for all
major subdivisions shall be submitted for review and preliminary approval by
the Village Administrator. The plan shall show the general runoff pattern of
the area which is to be improved as well as showing the runoff patterns of
adjacent areas which affect or may be affected by the proposed improved area. A
copy of the preliminary plan required by the Planning Commission may serve as
the preliminary drainage plan. Sufficient data shall be supplied for the
Village Administrator to check the feasibility of the drainage system and
stormwater runoff control as proposed by the developer. The preliminary
drainage plan shall be approved prior to the preliminary approval of the
subdivision plan by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Adequate drainage outlet. Surface water runoff of a development
shall be drained off site in accordance with this code. The location of the
adequate outlet shall be approved by the Village Administrator. The adequate
outlet may consist of a ditch, stream, storm sewer or approved retention
basins, having sufficient capacity to accommodate the surface water runoff in a
reasonable manner.
      (4)   Drainage easement. An adequate drainage easement shall be required
along any drainage way, ditch, watercourse, stream or storm sewer which is not
already within the public right-of-way. The easement shall be of sufficient
width to allow cleaning, widening, deepening, replacement or other general
maintenance of such drainage course. When it is required of the developer to
convey surface water outside the limits of the proposed improved area in order
to discharge into an approved adequate outlet, it shall be the responsibility
of the developer to obtain easements or rights-of-way for construction and/or
maintenance of such drainage course. All drainage easements shall be shown on
the plat and construction plans. The drainage easements shall be recorded for
public use and the maintenance of such drainage courses shall be the
responsibility of the property owners receiving direct benefit therefrom.
      (5)   Right-of-way for drainage structures. When a drainage structure
within the public right-of-way extends beyond the limits of the normal public
right-of-way, additional right-of-way shall be provided around the structure to
allow for adequate maintenance.
      (6)   Final drainage plan.
         (a)   A final drainage plan showing the entire drainage system shall
be submitted with utility improvements to the Village Administrator for
construction approval. The final drainage plan shall conform to these
regulations and to any special conditions that were required by the Planning
Commission in approving the preliminary plat. The final plan shall include
engineering calculations used in determining the design of the drainage
courses, the drainage structures and stormwater runoff control structures.
         (b)   The following shall serve as a minimum requirement for plans and
engineering calculations for the on-site drainage:
            1.   The total tributary drainage areas entering the improved area;
            2.   Times of concentration, intensity and runoff coefficients used
for determining runoff;
            3.   Discharge volume in cubic feet per second, velocity and
additional data needed to establish that the drainage system will convey the
flow to the approved adequate outlet;
            4.   The plan and profile of all drainage courses to where the
system discharges into the adequate outlet;
            5.   Size and type of all drainage improvements including all
drainage structures; and
            6.   Sufficient contours and grading details to show that the
proposed improvements will function adequately. All drainage construction plans
shall be sealed with the stamp of a professional engineer registered in the
state as required by R.C. Chapter 4733. The drainage plan shall be approved by
the Village Administrator prior to construction of any portion of the drainage
system.
      (7)   Storm sewers. The Village Administrator may require a storm sewer
system wherever an open ditch may present future problems, such as flooding,
erosion or endangers the health and safety of the residents of the subdivision
or wherever the pavement classification dictates a storm sewer system should be
used. The storm sewer system shall be designed to accommodate the tributary
drainage areas of the subdivision. The minimum drainage easement for storm
sewers outside of the right-of-way shall be 20 feet in width. This easement
shall be shown on both the final plat and the construction plans and it shall
be labeled “Public Drainage Easement.”
      (8)   Culverts.
         (a)   Culverts shall be used to convey water through a roadway
embankment and shall be designed so as not to impose a hazard to the roadway or
the surrounding area. Attention shall be given to alignment, grade and sizing
so hazards shall not exist.
         (b)   The design system shall be reviewed and approved by the Village
Administrator.
            1.   All culverts shall be installed, bedded and backfilled in
accordance with the State of Ohio Department of Transportation (O.D.O.T.),
Construction and Materials Specifications.
            2.   All conduit shall be reinforced concrete or approved equal.
            3.   The type of conduit used will be determined by the amount of
fill in the embankment in accordance with O.D.O.T. Construction and Materials
Specifications.
            4.   Headwalls and endwalls shall be installed when required by
O.D.O.T. design standards.
            5.   Any special treatment, including catch basins, improved
inlets, headwalls, stilling basins, energy dissipators, downstream channel
improvements and erosion control shall be taken into consideration by the
design engineer.
            6.   All culverts draining areas larger than 200 acres shall be
designated major culverts and shall be designed to convey a 25-year frequency
storm.
            7.   All culverts draining areas 200 acres or less shall be
designated minnow culverts and shall be designed to convey a ten-year frequency
storm.
      (9)   Subsurface drainage.
         (a)   Subsurface drainage shall be used as required to control the
flow of ground water. Subsurface drainage is to be used as measure to maintain
firm, stable subgrades and foundations; eliminating wet cuts and preventing
frost heave; and preventing sloughing and saturation of cut and fill slopes.
         (b)   Where a roadway consists of a total aggregate buildup with chip
and seal surface, it may be determined that an aggregate underdrain will
provide adequate subdrainage so long as the roadside ditch remains open and
provides an adequate outlet for the aggregate underdrain.
         (c)   Where a higher classification pavement is being used over any
aggregate base or where the ditches are closed in, pipe underdrains shall be
used. For roadway structures and slope stabilization, pipe underdrains are to
be used as required.
         (d)   In the design of the pipe underdrain system, consideration shall
be given to the type of pipe used, the filter material and the surrounding
soils that are to be drained in order to avoid clogging and achieve adequate
hydraulic capacity.
         (e)   The design and construction of all subsurface drainage systems
shall be reviewed and approved by the Village Administrator.
      (10)   Downspout drain lines.
         (a)   Downspout drain lines may be installed into the storm sewer
drainage system. The downspout drain lines should empty into the nearest catch
basin or manhole to prevent excessive pipe sizes for the downspout drain lines.
         (b)   A six inch pipe shall be the minimum size for the collector
line.
         (c)   The design and construction of the downspout drain lines shall
be reviewed and approved by the Village Administrator.
         (d)   Roof drains and sump pumps shall be tied into drains back of the
curb connected to the storm sewer system, or if impractical where the lot
slopes to the rear and a drainage swale, storm sewer or other outlet method is
available, it may be used if approved. All connection into the existing storm
sewer shall be inspected and approved by the Village Administrator.
         (e)   Under no circumstances shall any storm drainage system,
downspout drain line or footer drain be allowed to empty into a sanitary sewer.
      (11)   Hydrologic design.
         (a)   All calculations for the design rate of runoff (Q) shall be
submitted for review and approval of the Village Administrator.
         (b)   The rational method: Q = CIA
      Where: Q = Runoff (cubic feet per second)
      C = Runoff coefficient
      I = Intensity of rainfall (inches per hour)
      A = Tributary area (acres)
      Shall normally be an acceptable method for computing the design rate of
runoff for tributary areas of less than 200 acres.
         (c)   The ASCE Manual 1137: Design and Construction of Sanitary and
Storm Sewers shall serve as a guideline for formula.
         (d)   Table 4, Rainfall Intensity and Time of Concentration shall be
used in determining the intensity of rainfall.
         (e)   For tributary areas over 200 acres the Floods in Ohio -
Magnitude and Intensity Bulletin by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources or
the soil conservation service method may be used in computing the design rate
of runoff.
      (12)   Design frequency structures.
         (a)   The minimum design frequencies to be considered for drainage
structures shall be as follows:
 
Structures            Frequency (years)
Bridges               50
Culvert (minor)       10
Flood plain structure 100
Open ditch            10
Storm sewers          5
 
         (b)   The design frequency to be considered for an individual
structure may be altered by the Village Administrator where there is a flood
hazard or where the health and safety of the residents of the subdivision would
be endangered by inundation of stormwater.
      (13)   Open ditches.
         (a)   The minimum slope of open ditches shall be 1%. All ditches,
slopes and areas disturbed by construction shall be seeded and mulched.
         (b)   Ditch linings shall be installed as follows:
 
Type of Cover                                  Allowable Velocity (ft/second)
Seeded lining                                  0—3
Sodded lining                                  0—5
Lining to be approved by Village Administrator Above 5
 
         (c)   The minimum dimensional requirements for open ditches shall be a
two foot bottom width, one and one-half foot depth, with back slopes graded to
a four to one slope unless otherwise approved by the Village Administrator.
         (d)   All open ditches outside of the normal right-of-way shall be
protected with a minimum 20 foot drainage easement.
         (e)   The easement shall be shown on the final plat and the
construction plans and it shall be labeled “Public Drainage Easement.”
      (14)   Seeding and mulching.
         (a)   All ditches, right-of-way areas and areas disturbed during
construction are to be seeded and mulched. The specifications in Table 5,
developed in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service, outline the
minimum requirements that shall be followed for both rate of application and
time table for seeding.

FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT
§ 153.030 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. Article XVIII, § 3 of the Ohio Constitution
grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control
measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens.
Therefore, the Council of the village does ordain as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact. The village has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility
for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the flood
plain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the flood plain;
      (11)   Prevent flood plain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against the time of initial construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (E)   Lands to which these regulations apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the village as
identified in division (F) below, including any additional areas of special
flood hazards the village.
   (F)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Flood Boundary Maps and/or Flood
Insurance Rate Map # 390510-0001C, dated July 31,1981, and for any areas
annexed by the Village of Brewster;
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the state which has been approved by the
village as required by §
153.036(F), Subdivisions and Large Developments; and
      (3)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies thereto are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter. Copies of
such maps and studies are available for review at the office of the Village
Clerk-Treasurer at 302 S. Wabash Avenue, Brewster, Ohio.
   (G)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances or resolutions including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance or resolution, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not intend to impair any deed restriction
covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
   (H)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (I)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made
or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (J)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter
in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted
in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas,
unless there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions.
      (1)   ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   ZONE B and ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   ZONE C and ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year flood plain.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Flood
Plain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the state’s inventory of historic places
maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with standard
engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program flood plain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps or flood insurance studies.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, flood plain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. For the purposes of
these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in O.A.C. 3701-27-01, a MANUFACTURED
HOME PARK means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes,
used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes,
and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). A federal program enabling property
owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against
losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance
alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing
damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the
NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal
government that states if a community will adopt and enforce flood plain
management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in
special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make flood insurance
available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the “start of construction” commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Brewster, Ohio Flood
Insurance Rate Map # 390151D-0001C, effective on July 31,1981 and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district or state community college. AGENCY does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the flood plain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance
studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local
sources of data including, but not limited to, historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground. Anything constructed or erected,
the use of which requires permanent location on the ground, or attached to
something having a permanent location on the ground, including advertising
sign, billboards, roadside stands, but not including fences, or walls used as
fences.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damaged occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means flood related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed.
      (2)   The term does not, however, include:
         (a)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction;”
         (b)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
         (c)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these flood plain
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 153.034 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the village’s flood
maps, studies and other data identified in §
153.030(F) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate flood plain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified.
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         (b)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         (c)   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
153.037(F).
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with this division (A), prepared in a format required
for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and
submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
be the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Village Flood Plain Administrator shall require a conditional
letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a flood plain development
permit for proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Flood plain development permits issued by the Flood Plain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (A)(1)
above.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Flood Plain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact flood plain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the village and may be
submitted at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Village Flood Plain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce flood plain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the village’s flood
insurance rate map accurately represent the village’s boundaries, include
within such notification a copy of a map of the village suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the village has assumed or relinquished flood plain management regulatory
authority.
   (D)   Data use and flood map interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard.
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Flood Plain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Flood Plain Administrator.
      (3)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
         (a)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the
FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all
previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations; and
         (b)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no
base flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary
base flood elevations or floodway the base flood elevations and/or floodway
widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such preliminary data
may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Flood Plain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
153.038, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks and the like) shall prevail.

§ 153.035 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire and the like.
   (B)   After such a damage event, the Flood Plain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a flood plain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.

§ 153.037 ADDITIONAL STANDARDS TO ASSURE FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized.
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a flood plain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
153.034(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor of the village and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no flood
ways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a flood plain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible; and
         (b)   Division (A)(2)(a) and (A)(2)(c) through (A)(2)(e).
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse
the following standards apply.
      (1)   The bankfull the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse
shah not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a flood plain development
permit, the applicant must submit a description of the extent to which any
watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed
development, and certification by a registered professional engineer that the
bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Village Flood Plain
Administrator, may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the flood plain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
153.034(A) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 153.038 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   Appeals Board established.
      (1)   The Village Zoning Board of Appeals shall be designated as the
Appeals Board. As outlined in §
153.411 of the Village Zoning Code this Board shall consist of seven members
appointed by the Village Council. The members shall be residents of the
incorporated area of the village, and shall be composed of the five members of
the Village Planning Commission plus two others appointed for a term of three
years. Vacancies shall be filled by appointment of the Village Council and
shall be for the unexpired term.
      (2)   The Chairperson of the Village Zoning Board of Appeals shall chair
this Appeals Board. Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and
shall be held at the call of the Chairperson, or in his or her absence, the
Acting Chairperson. All meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the
public except that the Board may deliberate in executive sessions as part of
quasi-judicial hearings in accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question
and shall keep records of all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board
shall be kept and filed in the Village Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
   (B)   Powers and duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Flood Plain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations; and
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with division (D) below of these
regulations.
   (C)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Flood Plain Administrator, may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Flood Plain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Flood Plain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Flood Plain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Flood Plain Administrator’s decision was
made to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals
Board shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to
parties in interest and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (D)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
   (E)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the Flood
Plain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the flood plain; description of
the variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in §
153.439.
   (F)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Flood Plain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing. Notice will
also so be made by mail to any affected property owners at least ten days prior
to the hearing.
   (G)   Public hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing, the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations do not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (H)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (G)(1)(a) to (G)(1)(k)
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (I)   Procedure at hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses;
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance;
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance;
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel;
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal;
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance; and
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within
five days after the hearing.
   (J)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the County Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in R.C. Chapter 2506.

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in §
153.033(F).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a flood plain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
division (C) below.
      (3)   Flood plain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Flood Plain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with division (C) below.
   (B)   Notice of violation. Whenever the Flood Plain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he or
she shall give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and
order compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice
and order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

R-5 MOBILE HOME PARK
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
§ 153.120 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The village desires to promote a diverse range of housing
opportunities, including but not limited to affordable housing, within the
village. Promoting housing diversity includes providing for particular areas at
higher residential density typically associated with more urban areas. Mobile
and manufactured home developments are uses typically associated with such
areas. These higher density areas have unique development characteristics that
require special treatment in regard to standards, placement and land use
compatibility.
   (B)   The Mobile Home Park Residential District is established to provide
for such areas of higher residential density while encouraging a desirable
residential environment, protected from adverse influences, with adequate
access for vehicular traffic and circulation. These residential communities
shall be developed and located so as to not promote excessive vehicular traffic
on streets in adjoining residential areas, and shall provide overall
desirability equivalent to that for other forms of residential development.

MODULAR HOMES, MANUFACTURED HOMES,
MOBILE HOMES AND TRAILERS
§ 153.250 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Modular homes.
      (1)   MODULAR HOME is a prefabricated building or house that consists of
multiple sections called modules, which differ from mobile homes and
manufactured homes in that they do not have axles or a frame and do not have a
title. A modular home is factory-built to state code. Modular homes will not
have the red Certification Label but will have a label attached to the home
stating the code to which it was built. A modular home is constructed of pre-
made parts and unit modules that are assembled together on site. Wall panels,
trusses, and other pre-fabricated house parts are typically transported to
their site by means of flat-bed trucks and must permanently be anchored to the
outer perimeter of a frost free minimum eight-inch width permanent concrete
foundation set on a concrete footer at a minimum depth of 36 inches.
      (2)   Modular homes are permitted in R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 Residential
Districts and must conform to the height, lot area and floor area minimum and
all other requirements of those residential districts. Modular homes are also
permitted in I-2 Districts for use in temporary construction yards and
facilities.
   (B)   Mobile and manufactured homes.
      (1)   MOBILE HOME, also known as a TRAILER, means a single-family
dwelling, having been fabricated and designed for transportation on streets and
highways on its own wheels or on flatbeds or other trailers from its point of
origin, which arrives at the site where it is to be occupied as a dwelling
complete and ready for occupancy, except for minor and incidental unpacking for
assembly operations, location on jacks or permanent foundations, connection to
utilities and the like. A mobile home is a structure that has a title. A mobile
home is defined, but is not limited to, any structure that is defined as a
"manufactured home" under the provisions of the Manufactured Housing
Construction and Safety Standards of 1974, and any amendments or supplements
thereof.
         (a)   From R.C. § 4501.01, MOBILE HOME means a building unit or
assembly of closed construction that is fabricated in an off-site facility, is
more than 35 body feet in length or, when erected on site, is 320 or more
square feet, is built on a permanent chassis, is transportable in one or more
sections, and does not qualify as a manufactured home as defined in division
(C)(4) of R.C. § 3781.06 or as an industrialized unit as defined in division
(C)(3) of R.C. § 3781.06.
         (b)   Except as provided in divisions (C) and (D) of this section, no
mobile home, trailer or similar portable residential structure shall be
permitted to be located in the municipality except as in a mobile home
community as described in §
153.120 R-5 District - Mobile Home Park Residential District.
      (2)   Manufactured home.
         (a)   Manufactured homes are built to the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development HUD Title 6 construction standards (commonly known as
'the HUD-code'). The HUD-code took effect June 15, 1976. A HUD-coded home will
display documentation called the Certification Label and the Data Plate. The
red Certification Label (sometimes called the HUD Label) can be located on the
tail end of each transportable section of the home. The Data Plate will be
located inside of the home. Regulation states that the Data Plate be affixed
inside the home on or near the main electrical breaker box, or other readily
visible/accessible location. These documents are extremely important; as per
the HUD Title 6 regulation removal is illegal. Removal could hinder the buying,
selling, financing, or insuring of a manufactured home; they are not
replaceable. A manufactured home is a structure that has a title.
         (b)   Manufactured homes must be permanently attached to a black steel
frame, which acts as a support for the floor system. Once the home arrives to
the property, the wheels and axles are removed. Other names for these homes are
mobile homes, singlewides, double-wides, triple-wides, trailers and HUD homes.
A manufactured home is built on a permanent chassis to ensure transportability.
However, typically a manufactured home is not moved from its initial installed
site.
         (c)   From R.C. § 3781.06: MANUFACTURED HOME means a building unit or
assembly of closed construction that is fabricated in an off-site facility and
constructed in conformance with the federal construction and safety standards
established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to the
"Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974," 88 Stat.
700, 42 U.S.C.A. 5401, 5403, and that has a permanent label or tag affixed to
it, as specified in 42 U.S.C.A. 5415, certifying compliance with all applicable
federal construction and safety standards.
         (d)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, no
manufactured home shall be permitted to be located in the municipality except
as in a mobile home community as described in §
153.120 R-5 District - Mobile Home Park Residential District.
      (3)   Installation of mobile or manufactured homes. A mobile or
manufactured home shall be permitted in the village if and only if the
following conditions are met:
         (a)   Is located in an R-5 Mobile Home Park Residential District that
is compliant with the applicable chapters of the Ohio Administrative Code, the
Ohio Revised Code or any other state guideline or agency regulation and
requirements;
         (b)   All axles, wheels, towing hitches and removable towing apparatus
incidental to its conveyance are removed;
         (c)   A mobile or manufactured home shall be installed at the site in
accordance with the standards set in the applicable chapters of the Ohio
Administrative Code, the Ohio Revised Code or any other state guideline or
agency regulation and requirements;
         (d)   Detailed development plans and drawings illustrating the
building construction, the foundation construction, and the placement and
location of the proposed construction shall be submitted to and approved by the
Village Zoning Inspector prior to the placement of any mobile or manufactured
home, accessory structure, garage or other related building. The Village Zoning
Inspector shall work with any applicable state agency in the creation of a
mobile home park and for the installation of any mobile or manufactured home in
an established or new mobile home park;
         (e)   A mobile or manufactured home is located and installed in
accordance to the code standards of the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and to the extent not preempted by that code, the
manufactured home must be installed according to the local standards for
foundations, permanent utility connections and setback and minimum square
footage requirements;
         (f)   All mobile and manufactured homes shall meet the following
standards.
            1.   The home shall have no less than 900 square feet of floor
area.
            2.   The home shall have no less than 20 feet of exterior width.
            3.   The roof shall be pitched with a minimum vertical rise of two
and one-half inches for each 12 inches of horizontal run.
            4.   The exterior material shall be of a color, material and scale
comparable with those existing in residential site-built, single-family
construction.
            5.   The home shall have a non-reflective roof material which is or
simulates asphalt or wood shingles or tile.
         (g)   No connection of village utilities will be made unless the
electric, power and heating installations are in strict conformity with the
provisions of the village regulations, state statutes, the rules and
regulations issued by the Industrial Commission of Ohio under the authority of
the state statutes, and in conformity with the approved methods of construction
for safety to life and property;
         (h)   Such utility connections will conform with approved methods
prescribed by village regulations and the review and approval of the
appropriate utility superintendent;
         (i)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to supersede any valid
restrictive covenant of record.
   (C)   TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION YARDS AND FACILITIES means a yard or facility
the purpose of which is to provide the facilities, buildings, warehouses,
training facilities and other necessary adjuncts to the provision of
construction work necessary for a temporary construction project that is  not
located on the parcel, or the immediate vicinity, of the parcel where the
temporary construction yards or facilities are located. In all village zoning
districts, a mobile home or trailer may be used as a temporary office or
building incidental to construction or development of the premises on which the
mobile home or trailer is located, but only during the time of construction or
the development is actively underway.
   (D)   In an I-2 zoned district, mobile homes, modular homes and manufactured
homes shall be allowed and to be permitted to be used for any lawful
construction related purpose including, but not limited to, offices,
warehouses, employee use facilities (other than lodging), training, or safety
related uses for a period of up to 24 months, with the right to extend the use
for additional six-month periods upon notice to the Village Administrator while
the construction project(s) continue.

OIL AND GAS WELLS
§ 153.265 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   All provisions of §§
153.265 through
153.298 shall apply to all applicants for conditional zoning certificates for
oil and gas well permits. Brine disposal will not be permitted within the
corporation as specified in §
153.295. The heirs, executors or assigns of any individual permittee, and the
successors and assigns of any firm, partnership, association or corporate
permittee, as fully bound by these provisions as the original permittee. All
references to oil and/or gas shall be understood to include any other
hydrocarbon products of such well drilling operations.

§ 153.266 INTENT, AUTHORITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   It is the intent of this section, in addition to prescribing minimum
standards, to make drilling as safe as possible within the village, and also to
cause drilling activity to be carried on in those zoning districts where they
are specifically listed as a conditionally permitted use.
   (B)   The village is aware of the difficulty in setting rigid rules as to
the areas to be included in any one unit. It is the intent of this chapter to
have property drilled, when reasonable and expedient in the village’s judgment,
on one permit encompassing all appropriate and compatible properties and to
prevent the withholding of permission by a landowner for the sole purpose of
later requesting individual permission to drill on the same lot or area.
   (C)   The Planning Commission is herewith given full authority to impose
such requirements as it shall deem necessary to give full force and effect to
the intent as expressed in division (A) above. Each application for a permit
shall rest solely upon its merits and the prudent use of discretion by the
Planning Commission.
   (D)   The Planning Commission shall evaluate each application for a permit
according to procedures as prescribed in §§
153.365 through
153.367 and
153.380 through
153.383.

Commission. This conditional zoning certificate will expire one year after date
of issue if actual on-site drilling has not begun. The Planning Commission may,
for good cause, grant an extension up to one year, approved at a scheduled
public hearing. No well, or wells, shall begin production until compliance with
all provisions are certified by both the Fire Chief and the Village Zoning
Inspector.
   (B)   No person shall be permitted to drill more than two oil/gas wells at
any one time. Application for the third permit or any subsequent permits, may
be made upon completion of the drilling of the first, second and each
numerically subsequent well.

such hearing, in writing, all by regular mail and notice shall be given of such
hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the village.
The notice to the property owners and residents must carry a map showing the
specific location of the well. The public hearing must occur not less than
three weeks prior to the commencement of drilling. It shall be sufficient
notice to all of the residents of any one residential unit to address notice to
“Resident or Residents” at the mailing address of the residential unit.
   (B)   In addition thereto, the developer shall notify the Village
Administrator 48 hours prior to actual drilling.
   (C)   Compliance with the hearing provisions of this chapter shall be

has assented or which is to be drilled under the community lease or agreement
is to be located nearer to his or her property than the well or proposed well
site first above mentioned in this division (B), then the owner shall not be
permitted to object, but shall be deemed to have given his or her written
assent, under the provisions of this section, to drilling as well for oil and/
or gas on the proposed well site first mentioned above, then the owner shall
not be permitted to object, but shall be deemed to have given his or her
written assent, under the provisions of this section, to drilling a well for
oil and/or gas on the proposed well site first mentioned above.
   (C)   However, any owner who has united his or her property by entering into
a community lease or agreement as set forth in division (B)(4) above, shall not
share in any adjacent well production because of conflicting lease interests of
the real estate caused by the real estate being in more than one unitized area.
It is the expressed intention of this provision to prohibit an owner of
property from unitizing identical property under more than one community lease
or agreement.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS
§ 153.310 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to regulate, through
zoning, sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the
health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the village, and
to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious
location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the village.
The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing
a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor
effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Village Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,
501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986);
California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479
U.S. 92 (1986); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v.
City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County,
793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248
(5th Cir. 1995); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734
F.2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984), as well as studies conducted in other municipalities
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove,
California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas;
Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont,
Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General’s
Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General’s Working
Group On the Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6,1989, State of
Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Village Council
finds that:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of
these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises;
      (2)   Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-
related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually
oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the cities of Phoenix,
Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also Final Report
of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377;
      (4)   Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the
Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77;
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud
Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney
General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77;
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida;
      (7)   For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported
cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
was 523,056. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
      (8)   The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in
the United States reported during the ten-year period 1985 through 1995 was
367,796. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
      (9)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases reported
during the period 1993 through 1995. See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention;
      (10)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22,1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected
blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn;
      (11)   According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
      (12)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the
Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377;
      (13)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids,
including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented
businesses where persons view “adult” oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report
of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377;
      (14)   Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution,
increases sexual assaults and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g.,
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991);
      (15)   Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of
drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d
1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986);
      (16)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(17) raise
substantial governmental concerns;
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
      (18)   Zoning is an appropriate mechanism to see that the sexually
oriented business is located in an area consistent with the health, safety and
welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the village;
and
      (19)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
this village will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

more in conflict with the character and use of the district than the existing
nonconforming use as determined by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Restoration. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the reconstruction,
repairing, rebuilding and continued use of any nonconforming building or
structure, damaged by fire, collapse, explosion or acts of God, subsequent to
the date of this chapter wherein expense of such work does not exceed 60% of
the replacement cost of the building or structure at the time such damage
occurred.
   (D)   Construction approved prior to this chapter. Nothing in this chapter
shall prohibit the completion of construction and use of a nonconforming
building for which a zoning certificate has been issued prior to the effective
date of this chapter or any amendment thereto provided that construction is
commenced within 90 days after the issuance of such certificate; that
construction is carried on diligently and without interruption for a continuous
period in excess of 30 days; and that the entire building shall have been

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 153.395 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to recognize and accommodate in a unified
development, creative and imaginative residential development and to permit
those innovations in the technology of land development that are in the best
interests of the village.
   (A)   Intent. In order to accomplish this purpose, it is the intent in
establishing this subchapter to achieve:
      (1)   A variety of dwelling types including single-family and multiple-
family dwellings compatible with the purposes of planned unit developments
(PUDs);
      (2)   Flexible spacing of lots and buildings in order to encourage:
         (a)   Separation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation;
         (b)   Conservation of natural amenities of the landscape;
         (c)   Provision of readily accessible recreation areas and green
spaces;
         (d)   Creation of functional and interesting residential areas; and
         (e)   Provision of a necessary complement of community facilities,
such as central sanitary sewers and central water supply systems.
      (3)   In large-scale PUDs, suitable associated commercial and other
nonresidential uses consistent with the demand created by the PUD and
compatible with existing and proposed land uses adjacent to the PUD; and
      (4)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development, resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utility lines and streets.
   (B)   Special provisions governing PUDs. Because of the special
characteristics of planned unit developments, special provisions governing the
development of land for this purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict
or difference between the provisions of this section and those of the other
subchapters of the Zoning Code, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
Subjects not covered by this subchapter shall be governed by the respective
provisions found elsewhere in this Code. Except as specifically noted, nothing
in this section shall be interpreted to exempt PUDs from all provisions of the
subdivision regulations of the village. All PUDs are subject to site plan
review by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Uses. With an approved PUD, compatible residential, commercial,
institutional and open space uses may be combined as will enhance the living
environment of the planned development. All such uses shall be arranged to be
compatible with each other and not to adversely affect adjacent property and/or
the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (1)   The full range of dwelling types shall be permitted, including all
types of dwelling ownership and physical arrangements as judged by the Planning
Commission to be compatible with the purpose of the project.
      (2)   Commercial uses may be limited to those types judged by the
Planning Commission to be compatible with the purpose and the predominantly
residential nature of planned unit developments. Commercial uses shall only be
permitted in those PUDs of 25 acres or more, provided that such commercial
development shall not exceed the maximums specified in division (E) below.
      (3)   Institutional uses may be permitted within a planned unit
development as will be compatible with the predominantly residential nature of
a PUD. Such uses should be limited to 5% of the total PUD area and shall be
limited to uses, such as schools, churches and cultural facilities, judged
appropriate by the Planning Commission and compatible with the predominantly
residential nature of a PUD. Institutional uses shall be further controlled by
the standards in division (K)(1) and (K)(2) below.
   (D)   Minimum project area.
      (1)   The gross area of a tract of land to be developed in a PUD shall be
a minimum of ten acres. Smaller parcels may be considered for approval as a PUD
on the basis of their potential to meet the objectives of this division (D) as
stated in division (A) above.
      (2)   All land within the PUD shall be contiguous in that it shall not be
divided into segments by:
         (a)   Any limited access highway; or
         (b)   Any tract of land (other than streets or rights-of-way for
pipelines or electric transmission lines) not owned by the developer of the
planned development.
   (E)   Density. Total dwelling units (DU) per net acre and total commercial
area in a PUD shall not exceed the following maximums:
 
   DU/Net Acres Commercial Acres Per 100 DU
R-1 4.5          1.5
R-2 6.0          1.0
R-3 8.0          1.0
R-4 10.0         0.5
 
   (F)   Commercial activities. Commercial activities will be limited to the
following kinds of uses:
      (1)   Personal services such as barber and beauty shop, dry cleaning and
laundry agency, tailor and dressmaker, and shoe repair shop;
      (2)   Food sales of the grocery store and/or dairy store type, but not
exceeding 5,000 square feet of floor area in any single space of building;
      (3)   Drugstore;
      (4)   Florist and gift shop;
      (5)   Preparation and processing of food and drink to be retailed on
premises including bakery, delicatessen, meat market, confectionery,
restaurant, ice cream parlor and soda fountain, but not exceeding 5,000 square
feet of floor area for any single or combination of the above activities in a
single space or building;
      (6)   Accessory uses clearly incidental to the uses permitted on the same
premises; and
      (7)   Dwellings within the PUD may be arranged in any manner and at any
density, provided that overall density does not exceed the density maximums
specified in division (E) above.
   (G)   Commercial and institutional uses.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may approve an amount of commercial acreage
up to the maximums specified in division (E) above, and shall be guided by such
considerations as whether the location is appropriate for such uses, the
relationship of such uses to the adjoining circulation pattern and the
relationship of such uses to land use and development patterns adjoining the
PUD.
      (2)   When planned unit development districts include commercial or
institutional uses, such buildings and establishments shall be planned as
groups having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in
order to reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections
with thoroughfares. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on the
perimeter of the commercial or institutional areas abutting residential areas.
The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious design
of buildings and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, landscaping and such other features and
facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient
from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial areas. All
areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate improvement
or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a neat and
orderly manner.
   (H)   Yard, height and floor area regulations. Lot widths, setbacks and side
yards and building heights are flexible in order to allow for a variety of
structural and design arrangements. In reviewing building spacing proposals in
PUD plans, the Planning Commission shall be guided by factors such as spacing
necessary for adequate visual and acoustical privacy, adequate light and air,
fire and emergency access, glassed wall areas, building configurations, energy
efficient siting principles and relationship of building sites to circulation
patterns.
   (I)   Open space.
      (1)   A minimum of 30% of the net area of the PUD shall be reserved in
perpetuity for common open space and recreational facilities. Such open space
shall be available to and accessible to all residents of the PUD and shall be
designed primarily for their use. Open space shall be exclusive of all streets,
non-recreational buildings and individually-owned land.
      (2)   Design of common open space areas shall be governed by the
following standards.
         (a)   The Planning Commission may require a bond in lieu of provision
or dedication of the required open space in cases where final subdivision plats
are approved in stages, the amount of which shall be determined by the Planning
Commission.
         (b)   Permanent water bodies should comprise no more than 30% of the
required open space, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, depending on
the water body’s utility as a recreation or open space asset to the PUD.
         (c)   Open space areas and recreation areas shall be distributed
throughout the PUD and located so as to be readily accessible, available to and
usable by all residents of the PUD. Each parcel within the PUD should be
designed to abut upon common open space areas.
         (d)   Common open space may be improved with appropriate recreation
facilities and structures as long as total paved or roofed areas do not exceed
5% of the total open space area.
         (e)   Significant natural amenities such as outcroppings, tree stands,
ponds, ravines and stream channels should be left in their natural state and
considered part of the required open space, subject to the above standards.
   (J)   Disposition of common open space.
      (1)   Planned unit developments shall receive approval subject to
submission, prior to final subdivision approval, of legal instruments setting
forth a plan or manner of permanent care and maintenance of common open spaces
and recreation facilities. Approval by the Planning Commission of such
instruments shall be based on the following standards.
      (2)   The instruments shall guarantee that open space as shown on the
final development plan will remain as such. The Planning Commission may require
that all development rights to the open space be deeded to the village if the
Village Council will accept said deed, or deeded to another appropriate public
body, or that permanent restrictive covenants be attached to the open space.
         (a)   Common open space and recreation facilities shall be deeded to a
homeowners association, funded community trust or similar entity. If a private
entity is to hold title to common open space and recreation facilities, such
entity shall not be dissolved not shall it dispose of any common open space or
recreation facility without first offering to dedicate the same to the village.
         (b)   Such instruments shall convey to the village and other
appropriate governmental bodies the right of entrance to the common open space
and recreation facilities for emergency purposes or in the event of
nonperformance of maintenance or improvements affecting the public interest.
Such governments shall have the right, after proper notice, to make
improvements and perform maintenance functions with the costs levied as a lien
against the property if such a lien may lawfully be levied. Advance notice is
not necessary for emergency entrance onto such common areas and facilities.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may require a bond in lieu of provision of
dedication of the required open space in cases where final subdivision plats
are approved in stages, the amount of which shall be determined by the Planning
Commission.
   (K)   Indoor recreational and meeting facilities. All planned unit
development projects permitted in any district under these regulations shall
provide indoor recreational and meeting facilities as part of and integral to
the project. Such facilities shall be available for the use of all occupants of
the total project as defined on the general plan, and shall be completed at
such time as 60% of the total dwelling units indicated on the general plan are
completed and ready for occupancy and shall have adequate provisions recorded
as part of the dedication plans for the permanent maintenance and operation of
the facilities. Such facilities shall be constructed, as a minimum, in
proportion to the percentage of the total project being developed as part of
any phase up to the completion of 60% of the total dwelling units. Financial
guarantees acceptable to the Planning Commission may be utilized in place of
the actual construction of such facilities up to completion for occupancy of
50% of the total dwelling units as approved in the general plan.
      (1)   The first 50 acres:
 
Residential District Square Feet Per Dwelling Unit
R-1                  20
R-2                  20
R-3                  15

   (L)   Private streets. Private streets shall conform to the village
subdivision regulations for minor residential streets except that standards for
private streets on which 20 or fewer dwelling units have immediate access may
be modified upon approval of the Planning Commission after the Commission
obtains a recommendation from the Village Engineer.
   (M)   Collector streets and major thoroughfares. Collector streets and major
thoroughfares shall be designated as such by the developer upon submission of
general plans as provided in §
153.396. Such designations shall be subject to modification by the Planning
Commission so that an efficient traffic circulation system is established.
There shall be no direct access from single-family detached residential lots to
a major thoroughfare, and direct access from single-family detached residential
lots to collector thoroughfares shall be minimized. When there are more than 30
dwelling units in a grouping they shall have primary access to such dwelling
units from a public or dedicated street.
   (N)   Off-street parking. There shall be provided outside the public or
private right-of-way parking as required in §§
153.330 through

an area designated for guest parking as deemed appropriate by the Planning
Commission. All parking spaces and service drives shall be improved with
bituminous, concrete or equivalent surfacing and so graded and drained as to
dispose of all surface water accumulation with the area.
   (O)   Walkways. The pedestrian and bicycle circulation system and their
related walkways shall be insulated as much as possible from the vehicular
system in order to provide separation or pedestrian and bicycle movement from
vehicular movement. This may include pedestrian and bicycle overpasses or
underpasses in the vicinity of schools, commercial areas and such other areas
likely to generate a considerable amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
   (P)   Height regulations for single-family detached dwelling, single-family
attached and two-family dwellings. No structure shall exceed 35 feet in height
above the average finished grade line.
   (Q)   Height regulations for multi-family dwellings. No structure shall

APPENDIX A: RECOMMENDATIONS, MATERIALS AND FORMS
   The following recommendations, materials and forms are prepared as models
for use by village officials in the day-to-day administration of zoning. These
materials provide basic guidelines for handling almost all areas of zoning,
including the application for and issuance of zoning certificates, procedures
and forms for conditional zoning certificates, amendments to either zoning text
or maps, and zoning appeals and variances. Since zoning is one of the major
legal tools to guide and control development, it is important that it be
effectively and appropriately utilized. These model materials are also a basis
for establishing a greater degree of standardization and continuity in zoning
procedures and administration among neighboring political subdivisions.

10. PROCEDURE FOR A ZONING AMENDMENT.
   A zoning amendment or a zoning map change may be initiated by:
      a.   A village property owner.
      b.   A tenant.
      c.   A village resident.
      d.   An ordinance of Village Council.
      e.   Adoption of a motion by the Village Planning Commission.
1.   A village zoning amendment application is submitted by a property owner,
tenant or resident to Village Council, or a written request is provided by the
Planning Commission to Village Council. Village Council then reviews the
request and forwards it to the Village Planning Commission.
2.   As required by the O.R.C., within 30 days after receiving the proposed
amendment, the Village Planning Commission must provide a recommendation to
Village Council. This recommendation must be either the Planning Commission’s
approval, disapproval or modification of the proposed amendment.
3.   Upon receipt of the Planning Commission’s recommendation Village Council
is required to do the following:
      a.   Set a time for a public hearing. Council shall give a minimum of 30
days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the municipal corporation.
      b.   Have an ordinance prepared which reflects the recommendation of the
Planning Commission.
      c.   If the ordinance intends to rezone or redistrict ten or less parcels
of land, as listed on the county tax duplicate, a written notice of the hearing
shall be mailed by the Clerk of Council, by first class mail at least 20 days
prior to the date of the of the public hearing, to the owners of property
within and contiguous and directly across from the affected parcels. The
addresses used will those appearing on the County Auditor’s property tax list
or the Treasurer’s mailing list, and to such other list or lists that may be
specified by Village Council. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate any such ordinance or resolution.
      d.   During the above 30 days the text or copy of the text of such
ordinance or resolution, together with the maps or plans or copies thereof
forming part of or referred to in such ordinance or resolution and the maps,
plans, and reports submitted by the Planning Commission, Board, or officer
shall be on file for public examination in the office of the Village Clerk-
Treasurer or in such office designated by the Village Council.
4.   No such ordinance or resolution which violates, differs from, or departs
from the plan or report submitted by the Village Planning Commission shall take
effect unless passed by or approved by not less than three-fourths of the
membership of Village Council. An ordinance or resolution which is in agreement
with the plan or report submitted by the Village Planning Commission shall
require a simple majority vote for approval.
5.   Once the amendment is adopted by Village Council by ordinance or
resolution, it becomes law in 30 days from the date of adoption, unless it was
approved as emergency legislation.
6.   Once a request for a zoning amendment is denied, the applicant may
resubmit another request. Such a second request should be accompanied by new
evidence, facts, or figures not presented in relation to the original request.
In the event there is no new evidence or substantial change in the condition
originally considered by the Village Planning Commission or Village Council,
the applicant may still resubmit his or her request, but it is highly unlikely
that there would be any change in the final decision. The mere submission of
the request, or change in the ownership of the property in question, is not
considered sufficient reason for a zoning change.

         (a)   Tower design. The design of the tower, if any, shall be a single
enclosed pole, which is freestanding, without guy wires, or an open lattice
tower. When either type of tower is employed, it shall have anti-climbing
protection. A single enclosed pole shall have no climbing rungs for the first
15 feet from the foundation. A lattice tower shall have fencing or other
material of sufficient height to prevent climbing of the tower.
         (b)   Minimum blade height. The minimum height of the lowest extent of
the turbine blade shall be 30 feet above the foundation of the tower or 30 feet
above any structure or obstacle within 30 feet horizontally from any part of
the arc of the turbine blades.
         (c)   Noise. No wind energy system shall generate sounds exceeding 45
Dba as measured 100 feet from the tower or mounting base. Noise generated from
these systems shall also comply with existing village noise ordinances.

power interconnect agreement with the village. Both interconnect application
and interconnect agreements forms are available from the Village Administrator.
Under no circumstance shall wind energy systems provide power to off-site
buildings, structures, uses or other electric power energy distribution systems
(power grids) other than the village municipal power system.
         (g)   Signal interference. No wind energy system shall cause material
interference with television or other communication signals received from
abutting property owners. Once determined that the system is causing
interference, the owner shall take steps to filter, reflect or block any source
causing such interference. Failure to correct the cause for interference may
cause the village to terminate wind energy system use service until such time
the interference is corrected.
         (h)   Controls and brakes. All wind energy systems with external
blades shall be equipped with a redundant braking system. This includes both
aerodynamic over-speed controls (including pitch, tip and other similar
systems) and mechanical brakes. Mechanical brakes shall be operated in a fail-
safe mode. Stall regulations shall not be considered a sufficient braking
system for over-speed protections.
         (i)   Other requirements. Wind energy systems proposed to be connected

professional engineer from the State of Ohio.
      (4)   Specific information. Specific information on the type, size, rotor
material, rated power output, performance, safety and noise characteristics of
all parts of the system, including the name and address of the component
manufacturers model and serial numbers of all system components and statement
from the manufacturer that the system meets all applicable electrical codes.
All wind energy systems shall be designed to conform to all the requirements of
the Ohio Building Code, Ohio Residential Code, the National Electrical Code and
all other applicable regulations. All alternative energy systems proposed to be
connected to the village’s municipal power system shall be net metered, and
shall have grid failure disconnect systems and shall adhere to R.C. §
4928.67 and UL 1741, Standard for Utility-Interactive Applications.
      (5)   Insurance. Property owners of a wind energy system shall maintain a
current liability insurance policy which will cover installation and operation
of the wind energy system at all times. The liability insurance policy shall,
as a minimum, include covering bodily injury and property damage with limits of
at least $1,000,000 per occurrence and $1,000,000 in the aggregate. Property
owner shall provide a copy of a current policy and make part of the application
for a wind energy system. Annually property owner and/or wind energy system
owner shall be required to re-apply for a wind energy system permit which
requires proof of liability insurance coverage.
   (F)   Non-use. Any wind energy system which complies with the terms of this
chapter, but is not operable, excluding pending repair parts, shall be removed
within six months. The property owner shall remove the wind energy system at
their expense. Removal of the system shall include the removal of the entire
structure, including foundations, transmission/inter-connect equipment, and
fencing from the property. Failure to remove the system shall be deemed a
violation of this subchapter and shall be handled in the same manner as other
nuisances, Chapter 151, Property Maintenance Code, within the village, which
requires that the failure of an owner to remove an inoperable wind energy
system the village may petition the Stark County Municipal Court to, among
other remedies, abate the nuisance, require the owner to post a cash bond
totaling the estimated abatement cost, and/or file a written statement of all
costs and expenses incurred by the village related to the abatement of the
public nuisance with the court and submit a copy to the property owner. The
property owner shall pay to the village such amount of the costs and expenses
of the written statement as approved by the court within 30 days after court
approval. If the property owner fails or refuses to pay the village such amount
as approved by the court, then such amount shall be entered by the village upon
