EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances of Summit County
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation
of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio
Revised Code, and in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a
codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section
number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter
number is 305 (or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is
.06. The code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code
number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter
number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number appears right
of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the
chapter number is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section
number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance or resolution number originally assigned to it
at that time. Sections without histories indicate that the section contains new
matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance which enacts the individual
Code.
   Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER
OF
SUMMIT COUNTY, OHIO
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Summit County Charter was originally adopted by the
voters at an election on November 6, 1979. Dates in parentheses following a
section heading indicate that such section was amended or adopted on the date
given.
   The voters on November 5, 1991 approved the elimination of the elected
County Recorder on December 31, 1996, and the transfer of the duties of the
County Recorder to the County Auditor. The ordinance amending the Charter
directed the Charter wording not contain any reference to the Recorder. The
Recorder is a functioning official until December 31, 1996.
   On November 6, 2001, voters approved a charter amendment that consolidated
the elective office of County Auditor with that of County Treasurer. The
consolidation was effective June 17, 2002. Effective upon the consolidation of
the Office of County Auditor with the Office of County Treasurer, the County
Auditor's powers and duties, including the powers and duties of the previously
consolidated Office of County Records, were transferred to the County
Treasurer, which was renamed County Fiscal Officer.

   The citizens of Summit County, Ohio, believing that they can better govern
themselves on the county level, avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by
the Constitution of the State of Ohio to adopt this Charter.
ARTICLE I
CORPORATE POWERS, RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES
SECTION 1.01 NAMES, BOUNDARIES AND POWERS.
   The County of Summit, as its limits now are, or hereafter may be, shall be a
body politic and corporate by the name of County of Summit with all the rights
granted by this Charter and by general law.
   The County is responsible for the exercise within its boundaries of all
powers vested in and the performance of all duties imposed upon counties and
county officers by law. In addition, the County may exercise all powers
specifically conferred by this Charter or incidental to powers specifically
conferred by this Charter and all other powers which the Constitution and laws
of Ohio now or hereafter grant to counties to exercise or do not prohibit
counties from exercising, including the concurrent exercise by the County of
all or any powers vested in municipalities by the Ohio Constitution or by
general law.
   All powers shall be exercised and enforced in the manner prescribed by this
Charter, or, when not prescribed herein, in such manner as may be provided by
ordinance or resolution of the County Council, and, when not prescribed by the
Charter or amendments thereto or by ordinance or resolution, then such powers
shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by general law.
SECTION 1.02 POWERS LIMITED.
   The Charter does not empower the County to exercise exclusively any
municipal powers nor to provide for the succession by the County to any
property or obligation of any municipality or township without the consent of
the legislative authority of such municipality or township. In case of conflict
between the exercise of powers granted by this Charter and the exercise of
powers by municipalities or townships granted by the Constitution or general
law, the exercise of powers by the municipality or township shall prevail. The
County shall have power to levy only those taxes that counties are by general
law authorized to levy.
ARTICLE II

   The County Executive shall be the chief executive officer of the County. The

or her jurisdiction and control. Such powers and duties include, but are not

   (2)   To appoint officers and members of boards, agencies, commissions and

good faith efforts to reflect the diversity of the people of the County in

effect such removal shall be as follows:
   (1)   A petition signed by qualified electors demanding the election of a
successor to the person sought to be removed, shall contain a general
statement, in not more than two hundred words, of the grounds upon which
removal is sought. In seeking removal of the County Executive, a County elected
office holder or an at-large member of County Council, such petition must be

County Executive at the last preceding County election in that district.
   (2)   Petition papers shall be procured only from the Clerk of Council, who
shall keep a sufficient number on file for the use as provided by this section.

of papers issued, and shall certify upon each paper the name of the elector to
whom issued and the date of issuance. No petition paper so issued shall be

signature shall be stated the place of residence of the signer, giving the
street and number and ward and precinct. The signatures need not all be on one
paper. A person shall be designated in such petition to receive it in case of
return by the Clerk for insufficiency, as provided in this section. One of the
signers of every such paper shall sign an affidavit stating that each signature
on the paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to
be. All such papers for the removal of any one official shall be fastened
together and be filed as one instrument within thirty (30) days after the
filing with the Clerk of the affidavit stating the name and office of the
official sought to be removed. The Clerk, within ten (10) days after the filing
of such petitions, shall determine the sufficiency of such petition and attach
a certificate showing the result of his examination. If the Clerk shall certify
that the petition is insufficient, he shall set forth in the certificate the
particulars in which the petition is defective, and shall return a copy of the
certificate to the person designated in such petition to receive it.
   (4)   Such recall petition may be amended at any time within twenty (20)
days after the making of certificate of insufficiency by the Clerk, by filing a
supplementary petition upon additional petition papers, issued, signed and
filed as provided in this section for the original petition. The Clerk shall,
within ten (10) days after such amended petition is filed, make an examination
of the amended petition, and if his certificate shall show the same to be still
insufficient, he shall return it to the person designated in such petition to
receive it, without prejudice, however, to the filing of a new petition.
   (5)   If the Clerk shall determine that the petition or amended petition is
sufficient, he shall at once submit the same with his certificate to the
Council and forthwith notify the official sought to be recalled of such action.
If the official whose removal is sought shall not resign within five (5) days
after such notice, the County Council shall thereupon by order fix a day for
holding a recall election. Such election shall be held not less than forty (40)
nor more than sixty (60) days after the petition has been submitted to the
County Council. If possible, the recall election shall take place at the time
any general or special election is held within such period, but if no such
election is held, within the time previously stated.
   (6)   The Clerk shall transmit a duly certified copy of such order to the
Director of the Summit County Board of Elections or the successor to this
position. The election authorities shall publish notice and make all
arrangements necessary for holding an election, and the same shall be conducted
and the result returned and declared in all respects, as are the results of
general county elections.
   (7)   Each ballot at such election shall have printed upon it the following
question: “Shall (name of person) be removed from the office of (name of
office) by recall?” Immediately following such question, there shall be printed
on the ballot the following two propositions in the following order:
SECTION “For the recall of (name of person).”
SECTION “Against the recall of (name of person).”
      Immediately to the left on each of said propositions shall be a space in
which the elector may vote for either of such propositions.
   (8)   If a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling any
elected official shall be against the recall, the elected official shall
continue in office for the remainder of his unexpired term, but subject to
recall as before. If a majority of such votes be for the recall, then the
elected official shall be deemed removed from office upon the announcement of
the official result of such an election.
   (9)   When a person is removed from office by recall, the vacancy will be
filled in accordance with the provisions of this Charter and general law.

   (a)   The repeal of repealing legislation does not revive the legislation
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   Any legislation which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior legislation and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior legislation.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of any legislation does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If legislation enacted at different meetings of County Council
are irreconcilable, the legislation latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same legislation are enacted at different
meetings of County Council, one amendment without reference to another, the
amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to
each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of
enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted
by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   Any legislation is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If legislation is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of County Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the legislation was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the legislation.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.

111.04 MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM.
   (a) Policy Statement. The Minority Business Enterprise Program (MBE)
contained herein has been developed pursuant to Executive Order 11625 of
October 13, 1971.
   The Summit County Department of Community and Economic Development, in
response to legislative and regulatory mandates, affirms its responsibility and
commitment to assist in the full development of construction related business
resources.
   In accordance with that intention, the MBE Program presented here represents
this Department's commitment to a policy of equal opportunity for all in the
employment of business enterprises. This Department or its subgrantees shall
not discriminate against any business organization in the award of any contract
because of the race, color, sex, national origin, sexual orientation or gender
identity of its managers, employees or owners; and furthermore, affirmative
action shall be taken, consistent with sound procurement policies and all
applicable laws to ensure that minority-owned businesses are afforded a fair
and equal opportunity to be awarded contracts.
   The program shall be developed and implemented by the staff of the Summit
County Department of Community and Economic Development. However, the Community
and Economic Development Department as well as all subgrantees of the community
development block grant program shall share in the responsibility of making the
County's MBE program a success.
(Ord. 2001-254. Adopted 5-21-01; Ord. 2009-475. Adopted 11-30-09.)
   Goals.
   An effective MBE program requires that Summit County establish goals which
will serve to eliminate the causes which have, in the past, limited minority
business participation. The goals which Summit County establishes for the MBE
program are:
      (1)   To ensure that minority business enterprises have the maximum
opportunity to participate in all HUD funded contracts and subcontracts; and
      (2)   To require that all subgrantees make every reasonable effort,
consistent with the law, to utilize minority business enterprise in their
contracting process.
   In order to achieve these goals within a reasonable period of time, the
following set of specific MBE program objectives shall be pursued by both
Summit County and all program subgrantees who participate in the procurement
process.
      (1)   Develop the necessary inter-departmental commitments within Summit
County which shall result in coordinated efforts toward meeting the established
goals.
      (2)   Operate an outreach program to make minority business enterprises
aware of the projects to be completed during a program year. This will be
accomplished through advertising for contractors, mailouts listing projects,
the dates of bid advertising, and various speaking engagements.
      (3)   Provide opportunities for minority business enterprises to compete
in Summit County's Community Development Program.
      (4)   Require subgrantees to inform potential minority business
enterprises of bid notices.
      (5)   Periodically review the progress of Summit County's minority
business enterprise program to assess its effectiveness and make any necessary
changes in the program activities to achieve goals.
   It is the policy of Summit County that minority business enterprises shall
have maximum opportunities to participate in the performance of contracts
financed in whole or in part with Federal funds under this agreement. The
County and its subgrantees agree to provide full and fair utilization of
minority business enterprises and shall use its best efforts to insure that
minority business enterprises shall have maximum opportunities to participate
in the performance of contracts and subcontracts financed in whole or in part
with Federal funds. In this regard all subgrantees and prime contractors shall
take necessary and reasonable steps to insure that minority business
enterprises have an equal opportunity to compete in all contracting activities.
   Accordingly, Summit County shall attempt to award approximately ten percent
(10%) of all contracts to bonafide minority business enterprises. Nothing in
this clause shall be construed to require the utilization of any minority
business enterprise which is either not qualified or unavailable.
   The minority interest in a business must include significant control over
business operation. "Controlling" a business means having most of the actual
responsibility for the management decisions and day to day operations. A
company that cannot prove actual control, either direct or indirect, by
minority business owners, (for example of profits, cash investments, equipment,
planning, estimating, hiring, recordkeeping, correspondence, etc.) will not be
considered to be a bonafide MBE. A company where the principal person, owners
or stockholders are minorities and contributing substantial personal time to
such management operations shall be presumed to be a bonafide MBE.
   MBE's must not only be minority owned and controlled, but also perform a
true business function on the project. "A true business function" means that
the MBE must itself effectively perform the work or services or provide the
supplies specified under the MBE's contract and not act as a mere conduit. In
short, the contractual relationship shall be bonafide as well as the minority
ownership and control.
(Res. 81-192. Approved 5-5-81.)
   (b)    Requirements Concerning Affirmative Action. The minority business
enterprise policy is Summit County’s formal commitment to undertake actions
specifically planned to ensure equal employment opportunity practices by firms
contracting with Summit County or its subgrantees through the Community
Development Program. Also, such firms shall take affirmative action to assure
that minority business enterprises shall have maximum opportunity to
participate in the performance of contracts or subcontracts awarded by Summit
County or its subgrantees.
   As a result of this commitment each contractor providing services to Summit
County or its subgrantees shall meet requirements regarding the submission of
an acceptable affirmative action plan for the hiring of minorities, and for the
involvement of minority business enterprise.
   In the request for proposals and the invitation to bid, the following
information shall be submitted with the contractor’s bid response or proposal:
(Ord. 2001-254. Adopted 5-21-01.)
      (1)   Current workforce analysis; and,
      (2)   Statement that the bidder does not and will not discriminate in its
employment practices because of race, sex, religion, color or national origin;
and,
      (3)   All contractors who bid on projects over ten thousand dollars
($10,000) shall provide Summit County with an acceptable affirmative action
plan; and,
      (4)   If the project mandates MBE subcontracting arrangements, the prime
contractor shall designate a minority business enterprise and submit a detailed
work breakdown with the contractors bid or proposal.
         Information must include:
         A.   A written agreement between the prime contractor and the minority
contractor stating:
            1.   Name and address of minority contractor and prime contractor.
            2.   Scope of work to be performed by the minority firm.
            3.   Signatures of both parties; and,
      (5)   In cases where a written agreement between the prime contractor and
the minority contractor have not been reached prior to the submission of the
bid, a letter of intent shall accompany the bid/proposal. However, the written
agreement shall be submitted to Summit County before the execution of the
contract; and,
      (6)   Where an offer has been tendered to a minority firm by the prime
contractor to participate in a project and the minority firm is unavailable, a
letter shall be included in the bid proposal detailing that the firm is
unavailable; and,
         (Res. 81-192. Approved 5-5-81.)
      (7)   If a change occurs in the scope of work assigned to the minority
firm by the nonminority contractor, or if another minority firm is used as a
replacement or additional firm, notification shall be given to the Summit
County Department of Community and Economic Development prior to any such
changes and/or additions; and
      (8)   The Summit County Department of Community and Economic Development
shall supply, upon request, a list of names of appropriate minority owned firms
which may be used or a copy of the MBE Directory can be obtained from the
Community and Economic Development Department.
         (Ord. 2001-254. Adopted 5-21-01.)
      (9)   The Summit County Department of Planning and Economic Development
shall supply, upon request, a list of names of appropriate minority owned firms
which may be used or a copy of the MBE Directory can be obtained from the
Planning Department.

settle moral claims up to the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) without
Council approval. The County Executive shall make quarterly reports of all

definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   "Claim" means a written demand for monetary redress from the County
other than through the courts, and does not include lawsuits. Any claim on
which suit is filed shall thereupon cease to be a claim and shall be settled
according to law, as are lawsuits generally.
      (2)   "Moral claim" means a claim for which the County would have a legal
liability but for the fact that it has immunity and in which the factual
situation is such that good conscience and pure legal logic indicate that the
claim should be paid. Approval shall be based on a finding that legal liability
would exist but for the County's immunity and that additional facts exist
which, in good conscience, compel payment.
   (b)   Moral Claims Procedure.
      (1)   All moral claims against the County arising from injury or damage
to a claimant's real or personal property from alleged acts or omissions of the
County shall be referred to the Department of Sanitary Sewer Services ("DSSS")
Customer Service Research Analyst.
      (2)   The Research Analyst shall perform an investigation of the claim
affording a thorough examination of the facts and disclosure of evidence. The
investigation shall afford an opportunity to all interested parties to present
written evidence to DSSS concerning the incident in which such alleged moral
claim arose, together with documentation evidencing the amount of damages
sustained.
      (3)   After the Research Analyst investigates each moral claim, he shall
make a recommendation that the claim be denied, approved or approved in a
modified amount.
      (4)   The Research Analyst shall then submit the moral claim in which the
amount claimed is one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) or less, together
with supporting documentation and his recommendation thereon, to the DSSS
Director and legal counsel who may accept, reject or modify the recommendation.
The Director shall make a final internal decision disposing of such claims and
then forward his recommendation to the Prosecutor's Office for the final
decision prior to submission of the moral claim to the County Executive's
Office for authorization of payment.
      (5)   The Prosecutor's Office may, in its discretion, perform further
investigation of the moral claim.
      (6)   The Prosecutor's Office may accept, reject or modify the
recommendation of the Director and shall make final written recommendation to
the Director before submission to the County Executive for payment
authorization.
      (7)   The Director shall submit an Executive Order to the County
Executive's Office requesting authorization for payment to the claimant.
         (Ord. 92-346.  Adopted  6-4-92;  Ord. 2018-236. Adopted 6-18-18.)
119.05 EXECUTED RELEASE BY CLAIMANT.
   Prior to the payment of any moral claim to any claimant, the County shall
receive a legally binding release executed by the claimant, fully discharging
the County from any future claim or demand arising from the incident in which
such moral claim arose.

(Ord. 2006-544. Adopted 12-18-06.)
123.04 POWER OF COUNCIL TO SUBPOENA WITNESSES AND ADMINISTER OATHS.
   Upon the adoption of a resolution by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of Council, and
pursuant to the authority granted to County Council by Section

witnesses, and the Council President or the presiding member of any Committee
of Council may administer the oath or affirmation to any witness who may be

investigation, inquiry, or survey authority pursuant to this Chapter.
(Ord. 2006-591. Adopted 12-18-06.)
123.05 REPORTS.
   (a)   Any findings, determinations, or reports by Council or any Committee

Council, the Council shall promptly release to the public a general summary of

Enterprise Zone Guidelines

program in 1988 pursuant to State law through the adoption of this Chapter
145. Since that initial adoption, the County has enacted several enterprise
zones within the County. All of which are identified in this Chapter
145. This section was adopted in 1997 to provide guidelines and principles for
enterprise zone tax abatements negotiated by the local community and the
County. Periodically, this Section should be updated to provide guidance based
on standard practice in economic development across the State of Ohio and
current market conditions in the County of Summit.
   (b)    Purpose. The County of Summit wishes to encourage maximum investment
and job creation within Summit County while assuring that tax incentives are
utilized in a prudent and equitable manner. The County will permit the use of
tax incentives to encourage fair and equitable economic growth within the
County as well as to provide tools to be used for job retention. The County
particularly wishes to encourage projects where the goods and services produced
are sold outside the local economic area.
   (c)    Eligible Businesses.

   (e)    The following information applies to all zones within Summit County
and is provided in order to facilitate negotiations and compliance among all
parties.

recruitment, referral and placement of employees. In order for the
OhioMeansJobs Center to provide the employer with potential employees, the
employer will notify the OhioMeansJobs Center of job openings along with job
descriptions. Notification shall also include the number of employees needed by
job title, rates of pay, hours of work, anticipated duration of employment, and
work to be performed. The employer shall also notify the OhioMeansJobs Center

   (g)    Notice to Department of Community and Economic Development. The local
community shall notify the Director of the Summit County Department of

5709.83, each municipality and/or township is required to notify in writing the
school superintendent and school treasurer of each school district that is
affected by the pending tax abatement. The school superintendent and treasurer
shall be encouraged to comment in writing and forward their comments to the
municipality and/or township about the proposed abatement, a copy of which must
be submitted with the approved legislation to Summit County Council, and the
same shall be kept on file by the Clerk of Courts.
   (i)   Hearing Before County Council. When a tax abatement agreement and
legislation is before County Council's Planning Committee, officials
representing the company shall be in attendance. If a request for an abatement
exceeds the above-stated guidelines, representatives from the company and
representatives from the local community shall attend the hearing.
If a local community wishes to submit a project to the County which exceeds
these guidelines, the local community shall be prepared to present to Council
reasons for exceeding the guidelines.
      (Ord. 2022-131. Adopted 5-9-22.)
145.05 TAX ABATEMENT PRINCIPLES.
   (a)    Abatements Required. Summit County Council recognizes that tax
abatements may be required:
      (1)   In response to inter-state competition for employers;
      (2)   To encourage the location, expansion and retention of employers;
      (3)   To assist in the redevelopment of economically disadvantaged
communities; and
      (4)   To support the reuse of environmentally damaged buildings and
sites.
      (5)   Assist businesses whom but for the tax abatement would not find it
financially viable to make a real property investment.
   (b)    Supporting Regional Cooperation. Cooperation among County and local
governments to support regional economic development and job creation should be
promoted. Economic development is a regional issue and teamwork among
governmental units will help ensure the economic viability of the region.
   (c)   Responding to Inter-State Economic Development Competition. Tax
abatements, and other forms of public finance incentives, may have to be
provided to firms as a result of inter-state competition.
   (d)    Distressed Communities and Sites.
      (1)   Tax abatements in an enterprise zone are a means of encouraging
firms to locate and expand in distressed municipalities.
      (2)   Employment distress occurs where unemployment rates are
substantially above the state average and where labor force participating rates
are substantially below the state average. Unemployed residents of these
distressed communities should be hired as a result of any abatement.
      (3)   Environmental distress occurs in existing buildings and sites that
have been used for business and industry and is substantially contaminated with
hazardous materials. The reuse of these sites is a public purpose and an
abatement would help to partially offset the cost and risk in doing so.
   (e)    Mayors, city councils, school boards, township trustees and county
governments should be guaranteed an opportunity to express their opinions about
the establishment of enterprise zones and proposed abatements because they are
affected by these actions.
(Ord. 2022-121. Adopted 5-9-22.)

157A.01 CREATION.
   Pursuant to Sections 307.282, 307.283 and 5739.026 of the Revised Code, this
Council hereby creates and establishes a community improvements board, which

Revised Code, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The Board
shall consist of nine members, who shall be appointed in accordance with

of the Ohio Revised Code for the purpose of Division (A)(4) of that section.
(Ord. 2002-374. Adopted 8-12-02.)
157A.02 GUIDELINES IN AWARDING GRANTS.
   (a)   The provisions of this section shall serve as guidelines that are to
be followed by the Board in awarding grants to public school districts from
grant revenue, as defined in Section 307.283 of the Ohio Revised Code. In
making an award of such grants under Section 307.283 of the Ohio Revised Code,
the Board shall comply with that section and this chapter.
 
   (b)   For purposes of the Board’s award of grants, “government agency” shall
mean, and shall be limited to, each public school district:
      (1)   Any part of which is located in the County,
      (2)   That has students that live in the County,
      (3)   That has educational facilities located within the County, and
      (4)   That educates students in kindergarten through high school,
including any successor thereto. The Board shall award grants only to such
governmental agencies under Section 307.283 of the Ohio Revised Code that are
public school districts as defined hereinabove.
 
   (c)   At present, such public school districts are:
      (1)   Akon City School District.
      (2)   Barberton City School District.
      (3)   Copley-Fairlawn City School District.
      (4)   Coventry Local School District.
      (5)   Cuyahoga Falls City School District.
      (6)   Green Local School District.
      (7)   Hudson City School District.
      (8)   Manchester Local School District.
      (9)   Mogadore Local School District.
      (10)   Nordonia Hills City School District.
      (11)   Norton City School District.
      (12)   Revere Local School District.
      (13)   Springfield Local School District.
      (14)   Stow-Munroe Falls City School District.
      (15)   Tallmadge City School District.
      (16)   Twinsburg City School District.
      (17)   Woodridge Local School District.
 
   (d)   In accordance with Section 307.283 of the Ohio Revised Code, a grant
shall be awarded for a permanent improvement project, as defined in Division
(A)(8) of that section, of such a school district, including, to the extent
permitted by law, one or more currently proposed or ongoing permanent
improvement projects in the County, one or more future permanent improvement
projects including the funding of a permanent improvement fund or account of
the school district for such purpose, and the payment of public obligations
incurred or to be incurred to finance permanent improvement projects of a
school district to be located in the County. A permanent improvement project in
the County may include technology improvements and educational materials that
are certified by the fiscal officer of the school district, which certification
is conclusive, as having an estimated life or period of usefulness of five
years or more.
 
   (e)   In order to assure a fair and equitable distribution of grant revenue
to each of the school districts, the available grant revenue shall be awarded
each year to a school district for a permanent improvement project in
accordance with the following formula.
 
   Amount of grant = Available Grant Revenue x % ADM
 
   Where:
 
   “Available Grant Revenue” shall have the meaning set forth in Division (A)
(2) of Section 307.283 of the Ohio Revised Code.
 
   “% ADM” is equal to the ADM of the school district divided by the total of
the ADM of all the school districts.
 
   “ADM” is the school district’s total ADM (average daily membership), as
described in Section 3317.03 of the Ohio Revised Code and as determined in
October of the prior year, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    For each school district with territory entirely within the
County, “ADM” is the same as total ADM; and
      (2)    For each school district with education facilities in the County
but with a portion of its territory outside the County, “ADM” for such a school
district shall equal the total ADM of that school district multiplied by the
quotient resulting from dividing the number of students used to calculate the
total ADM of that school district that reside within the County divided by the
total ADM of that school district, as certified to the Board by the school
district.
 
   (f)   Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount of a grant to a school
district for each year shall be determined and limited by the above formula.
Each school district applying for a grant shall submit its application to the
Board in accordance with a schedule approved by the Board. In such application,
the school district shall describe the permanent improvement project purpose
for which grant application is being made. The school district shall also
certify its ADM to the Board on or before that date. If the Board does not
receive such certification from a school district, it shall determine the ADM
for that school district, which determination shall be conclusive. At a date to
be determined by the Board, but at least once annually, the Board shall award a
grant to each of the school districts in the applicable amount determined under
the formula if the permanent improvement project for each such school district
meets the requirements set forth herein.
 
   (g)   If a school district does not apply for a grant in any year or it does
not qualify for a grant in any year, the amount of a grant that could have been
made hereunder shall be reserved by the Board for that school district in a
separate account for a period of ten years. If the school district has not
applied and qualified for a grant within that period, the amount so reserved
shall be removed from that account and shall become available for use by the
Board in awarding grants in accordance with the above formula.
 
   (h)   Grant award bonds may be issued in accordance with Section 307.283 and
307.284 of the Ohio Revised Code.
 
   (i)   Any modifications to the provisions of this section may only be made
with the approval of at least seven members of the Board and must be further
approved by at least eight members of the Council of the County of Summit.

that requires an announcement to be posted by the HRD. Classified positions
which become open shall be filled, as practicable, by promotion of present

employment or for discharge of an employee from service.

required to undergo a medical examination prior to appointment. Such
examinations may only be required after a conditional offer of employment.

holding other full-time public employment with any County of Summit office,
agency and/or department. If an employee is employed elsewhere, at no time may

activities. A refusal may result in dismissal.

that the hiring, promotion, transfer or demotion of a person into a position is
consistent with the staffing levels set forth in the Report.

November 15th of each year with either the proposed temporary or permanent
operating budget for the next fiscal year, and may be amended by Council prior

169.07 COMPENSATION.
   (a)    Reservation of Rights. Nothing in this Chapter shall derogate,
diminish or interfere with any appointing authority's power to hire, fire,
discipline, transfer, promote, demote or otherwise manage any of the employees
under the appointing authority's jurisdiction. However, such actions are
governed by the rules of the Human Resource Commission, certification of the
availability of sufficient appropriated funds by the Department of Finance and
Budget and County Council legislation. The Department of Finance and Budget
shall advise an Appointing authority within a reasonable period of time whether
sufficient appropriate funds are available for the appointment of a new
employee or a pay increase for a current employee.
   (b)    Personnel Requisitions.  All requisitions for positions, actions for
promotion, hires, reassignments, demotions, temporary working levels, etc. must
be submitted to the Director of the Department of Human Resources along with
all required documentation, two (2) weeks prior to the effective date of such
actions. The Director of the Department of Human Resources shall approve or
disapprove the action and advise the appointing authority within ten (10) days.
   (c)    Salary Adjustments. No salary adjustments (e.g. merit, steps, bonus
or other salary increases, etc.) shall be permitted unless the Department of
Finance and Budget certifies the availability of sufficient appropriated funds
for the adjustment and the adjustment is approved by County Council.
   (d)   On-Call Duty Pay. Employees in a supervisory position in the
Department of Sanitary Sewer Services may be scheduled to be on-call and
available to respond to situations involving facilities or assets at times
other than during the regularly scheduled workday (i.e. equipment failure,
severe weather, flooding, etc.). The County Executive may issue an Executive
Order authorizing the payment to such employees of a sum not to exceed one
dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per each hour that the employee is on-
call and be required to respond to situations outside the regularly scheduled
workday. Said payment shall be paid as compensation to an employee in the same
manner as all other compensation, subject to withholding of taxes and other
appropriate deductions. The County Executive shall also include in the
aforementioned Executive Order any terms, requirements and/or prohibitions of
activities that any employee shall adhere to during such time the employee is
scheduled to be on-call and available to respond to situations outside the
regularly scheduled workday.
   Any payments made by the County to employees prior to the effective date of
this subsection (d) that would otherwise be governed by this subsection (d) are
hereby ratified, approved and authorized by County Council.

169.08 CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (a)    Introduction. The County of Summit, in an effort to provide fair and
equitable compensation for classified, non-bargaining unit employees,
established compensation systems as follows:
 
   Plan       Category Of Employee
   Category 1    Entry-level clerical and other supportive job classifications
   Category 2    Specialized clerical, technical, paraprofessional and lower
level supervisory classifications
   Category 3    Administrative, management and professional classifications
 
   The plans developed cover all classified non-bargaining unit employees who
are under the jurisdiction of the following appointing authorities:
 
   Clerk of Courts
   County Council
   Engineer
   Executive
   Fiscal Officer
   Prosecutor
   Sheriff   
 
   The plan will be administered by the Human Resource Commission. As existing
classifications are revised or new classifications are created, the Director of
the Department of Human Resources shall determine the category to which the
classification will be assigned. The Director of the Department of Human
Resources will evaluate the new or revised classification in accordance with
the criteria established in the point factor manual appropriate to the
category.
   (b)    Plan Structure - Categories 1, 2 And 3 Classifications. Each of the
three (3) categories of job classifications has been assigned to a pay
schedule. Each pay schedule features several pay grades. Within each pay grade,
a minimum rate, midpoint rate, and a maximum rate have been identified. This
structure will enable the County Council to grant increases on a percentage
basis between the minimum and maximum.
   Each non-bargaining classification has been assigned to a pay grade within
the assigned pay schedule. These assignments have been the result of the point
factor analysis of each classification and consideration of labor market
factors. Employees shall advance through their assigned pay grade by way of
receiving periodic general increases as authorized by the County Council and
with the approval of the appropriate appointing authority.
   In order to better illustrate the systems, the following discussion will
examine each component.
   (c)    Minimum Rate, Midpoint Rate and Maximum Rate. The minimum rate for
each pay grade, and the classifications assigned to that pay grade, is the base
or starting rate. New employees shall normally be hired at the minimum rate for
their classifications. Exceptions may be made for new employees who possess
outstanding qualifications and/or experience. No new employee may be hired at a
rate which exceeds the midpoint of the employee's pay grade unless authorized
specifically by the County Council. The maximum rate is the top rate for a
classification. No employee may be paid at a rate which exceeds the maximum
rate for the employee's classification. The exception to this rule is any
employee who is making more than the maximum rate at the time the new pay
schedules are implemented.
   Following an initial placement, promotion or reassignment of an existing
employee, the employee will advance through pay grade by the granting of a
general increase, based upon this decision of the County Council and the
concurrence of the employee's appointing authority.
   (d)    General Pay Increases. The amount and frequency of general pay
increases will be determined by the County Council. This general increase may
include an adjustment of minimum or maximum rates. Decisions to increase
minimum and/or maximum rates in any schedule should be based upon periodic wage
survey data. The HRD shall conduct periodic surveys of comparable employers in
order to provide input to the County Council in this decision making process.
   In addition to any annual general increase to all classifications that may
be approved by the County Council, upon the recommendation of the Director of
the Department of Finance and Budget, the Director of the HRD and the HRC,
Council recognizes the need to reward employees for their meritorious service.
Any employee that has not reached the maximum of the pay grade may receive a
discretionary increase of up to five percent (5%) per calendar year for
exemplary service, as may be determined by the elected officeholder.
   (e)    Implementation. For purposes of implementing the new salary schedule,
an employee will be assigned to a rate within the pay grade in accordance with
the departmental employee rosters provided to the elected officeholders as a
component of this plan. Initial and other step adjustments shall become
effective as identified.
   (f)    Probationary Increases. An appointing authority shall be permitted to
grant a newly hired employee, excluding promotions and reassignments, an
increase of up to five percent (5%) upon successful completion of the
employee's probationary period. However, such increase may not cause an
employee's rate of pay to exceed the midpoint of the employee's pay grade.
Probationary increases are not available for employees who are hired at a rate
of pay at or beyond the midpoint for the employee's classification.
   (g)    Movement Between Pay Grades.
      (1)   Promotion. A promotion is the act of placing an employee in a
classification, which requires greater skills, knowledge and abilities to
perform more complex and responsible work than the employee was required to
perform in the employee's previous position. When an employee is promoted, the
employee will be advanced to whichever is the greater of the following:
         A.   The minimum rate for the employee's new classification; or
         B.   A rate of pay which is seven percent (7%) greater than the
employee's current rate of pay provided that said increase does not exceed the
maximum rate of pay established for the classification.
      (2)   Demotion.  When an employee is reassigned to a lower
classification, or reclassified to a lower classification, or demoted other
than as a result of a disciplinary action or probationary reduction, or
voluntarily accepts a reduction, the employee shall be placed at a rate in the
new pay grade which does not exceed the employee's prior rate of pay. If the
employee is reduced during the probationary period, the employee shall be
returned to the former pay grade and placed at the rate that the employee would
have been in if the employee had not accepted the promotion. If the employee is
reduced for disciplinary reasons, the appointing authority shall assign the
appropriate rate of pay.
      (3)    Transfer. A transfer is the act of moving an employee from a
position in a work unit to a position with the same classification title in
another work unit. A transfer may also result in a change in work location and/
or supervisor, but not a change in significant job duties. An employee's rate
of pay will not change as a result of this type of action.
      (4)    Lateral Movement. A lateral movement is when an employee is
assigned to a position, which is in a different classification than the
employee's former position, but the classifications are assigned to the same
pay grade and schedule. An employee's rate of pay will not be affected by such
change.
      (5)    Temporary Assignments.  A temporary assignment is the act of
assigning an employee to a job classification different than the employee's own
for a temporary period of time. Such assignments normally occur because of
illness, emergencies or other special circumstances. An employee temporarily
assigned to a classification with a lower rate of pay will not be reduced in
pay. An employee temporarily assigned to a classification with a higher rate of
pay should be advanced to whichever is the greater of the following:
         A.   The minimum rate for the classification to which the employee has
been temporarily assigned; or
         B.   A rate of pay which is at least seven percent (7%) greater than
the employee's current rate of pay.
         However, no temporary increase will exceed the maximum rate of pay
established for a classification.
         NOTE: In order to receive a temporary increase, an employee must be
temporarily assigned the full duties and responsibilities of the higher level
classification. Temporary assignment of partial duties and responsibilities of
the higher-level classification will not qualify an employee for a temporary
increase. Also, an employee who is temporarily assigned partial duties and
responsibilities of a lower classification will not be eligible for additional
compensation.

169.09 CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLAN - CLASSIFICATIONS, CATEGORY AND
GRADE ASSIGNMENTS.
   The County Council shall adopt by resolution classifications, categories and
pay grade assignments for employees of the County of Summit. The
classifications, category and grade assignments document shall be maintained by
the Department of Human Resources. Updates and copies shall be furnished to
each appointing authority.
(Ord. 2004-596. Adopted 2-14-05.)
 
169.10 CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLAN - WAGE AND SALARY SCHEDULE.
   The County Council shall adopt by resolution a wage and salary schedule for
Categories 1, 2 and 3 and unclassified employees of the County of Summit. The
wage and salary schedule shall be maintained by the Department of Human
Resources. Updates and copies shall be furnished to each appointing authority.
(Ord. 2004-596. Adopted 2-14-05.)
 
169.11 CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLAN - MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Responsibility. The primary responsibility for maintaining the
classification and
compensation plan for classified employees, as defined in Section
169.02(f), shall rest with the Commission through the HRD.
 
   (b)   Final Decisions. Final decisions, including but not limited to
advanced range hiring, revised pay grade assignments, and addition of new
titles to the plan and wholesale changes to the salary schedules shall rest
with the County Council, as recommended by the Commission, before implemented
by the appointing authority.
   The County Council shall, in addition to the responsibilities already
identified, retain the authority to implement other changes to the plans in
order to ensure they meet the needs of County government.
 
   (c)   Personnel Actions. Each appointing authority shall be responsible for
following the Commission Rules and Chapter
169 of the Codified Ordinances when making appointments, terminating,
promoting, demoting, transferring and laterally reassigning employees.
 
   (d)   Maintenance. Each appointing authority shall retain the authority to
discontinue using a classification in the appointing authority's office.
However, only the County Council upon the recommendation of the Commission will
have the authority to permanently abolish or delete a classification from the
classification plan. This will normally occur based upon the request of the
appointing authority, and after such request is reviewed by the HRD for the
plan covering classified employees of those appointing authorities defined in
Article II, Section
2.03(11) of the County Charter, and after such is recommended to the County
Council.
   Each appointing authority shall retain the authority to request using a
classification that exists under the classification plan, but has never been
used in the appointing authority's office before, such is appropriate based
upon duties and responsibilities.
   Each appointing authority shall retain the authority to request the
Commission create an entirely new classification. This will include the County
Council's approval of the new classification title, classification
specification, classification number, point factor score and pay grade
assignment. The classification title, classification specification, etc., will
be based upon the recommendation jointly developed by the appointing authority
requesting the new classification and the HRD, for the plan that covers
classified employee of those appointing authorities defined in
Article II, Section
2.03(11) of the County Charter.
   If the appointing authority requesting the new classification and the HRD
are unable to mutually agree upon the classification title, classification
specification, point factoring or grade assignment within thirty (30) calendar
days from the date the proposed change to the plan that covers classified
employees is submitted, the Director of the HRD shall immediately inform the
Commission in writing of the dispute. Such issues shall then be processed in
accordance with the rules and procedures of the Commission. After hearing each
side's position on the issue, the Commission will make a recommendation to the
County Council regarding the matter. The County Council will retain the
authority to accept the recommendation of the Commission, or the recommendation
of the appointing authority, or to modify one (1) of the recommendations, or to
reject all recommendations. The County Council's action will be final.
   Each appointing authority shall retain the authority to ask the Commission
to change the pay grade of a classification due to increased responsibility
(and corresponding point factor score) or for some other legitimate business
reason. However, prior to petitioning the County Council to effect such a
change, the appointing authority shall first review the proposed modification
with the HRD, in order to obtain concurrence on the proposal.
   If the appointing authority requesting the pay grade change and the HRD are
unable to mutually agree on the proposed change for the plan that covers
classified employees, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the
proposed changes is submitted, the Director of the HRD shall immediately inform
the Commission in writing of the dispute. Such issues shall then be processed
in accordance with the rules and procedure of the Commission. After hearing
each side's position on the issue, the HRC will make a recommendation to the
County Council regarding the matter. The County Council will retain authority
to accept the recommendation of the Commission, or the recommendation of the
appointing authority, or to modify one (1) of the recommendations, or to reject
all recommendations. The County Council's action will be final.
   Each appointing authority shall retain the authority to ask the Commission
to make changes to the classification specifications when such appear to be
justified. However, prior to petitioning the County Council to effect such
change, the appointing authority shall first review the proposed modification
with the HRD in order to obtain concurrence on the proposal. If the appointing
authority requesting the classification specification change and the HRD are
unable to mutually agree on the proposed changes for the plan that covers
classified employees, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the
proposed change is submitted, the HRD Director shall immediately inform the
Commission in writing of the dispute. Such issues shall then be processed in
accordance with the rules and procedures of the Commission. After hearing each
side's position on the issue, the Commission will make a recommendation to the
County Council regarding the matter. The County Council will retain authority
to accept the recommendation of the Commission, or the recommendation of the
appointing authority or to modify one (1) of the recommendations, or to reject
all recommendations. The County Council's action will be final.
   The HRD will be authorized to make such changes to the classification
specifications as may be necessary for reason of minor update and corrections
as may be requested by appointing authorities or so recognized by the HRD, that
have no effect upon the point factoring to change grade assignment, or to make
such changes in format and/or change as may be mandated by law. Such change to
the classification specifications will be coordinated with each appointing
authority using the classification that is the subject of change, and
distribution of final updates will be made accordingly. Record of such change
will be maintained and recorded on the classification plans.
   Each appointing authority shall have the responsibility of reporting all
personnel actions (appointments, promotions, lateral reassignments, approved
pay increases or decreases, demotions, terminations, etc.) to the Director of
the HRD for approval at least two (2) weeks before the effective date. Such
personnel action shall be complete in total using the form provided by the HRD,
with the signatures of approval as required by the Commission and Executive.
   The HRD shall have the responsibility of investigating possible misuses of
the plan that covers classified employees by any of those offices included in
the plan as defined in
Article II, Section
2.03 (11) of the Charter. If such misuses affecting classified employees are
found, they will be reported to the Director of the HRD for appropriate action,
in accordance with the rules of the Commission.
   The HRD shall be authorized to monitor the system through electronic review
of wage and salary data, and periodically conducting classification audits of a
random sampling of positions included in the classification and compensation
plan for classified employees. In the event of alleged misuses, discrepancies,
or misapplications of the plan are identified by the HRD, they will be reported
to the Director of the HRD for appropriate action, in accordance with the rules
of the Commission.
   The HRC shall be responsible for hearing classification appeals that have
not been resolved by a classified employee and the employee's employer. No
classified employee shall be permitted to file a classification appeal with the
HRC until the employee first attempts to resolve the matter with the employer.
 
   (e)   County Council Compliance and Enforcement Policy. Administrative
compliance provisions for the maintenance of the Standard Classification and
Compensation Plan for classified employees shall rest with the Director of the
HRD.
      (1)   The Director of the HRD shall attempt to obtain a voluntary
resolution to a violation through discussion with the appointing authority as
related to their area of authority and in keeping with the procedures and
policy of maintenance.
      (2)   If unresolved and upon notification by the Director of the HRD to
the Commission, a written recommendation shall be made to the full County
Council to issue an order to the appointing authority to take such action to
correct the violation, or
      (3)   To issue an order to the County Fiscal Officer to withhold or
correct the affected wages/benefits of the employee's pay, and/or
      (4)   To take such budgetary controls or other means necessary to enforce
such order. Time frames for resolving such issues shall follow specific periods
per the Commission Rules, administrative guidelines, related ordinances or
resolutions, maintenance provisions of the classification and compensation
plan, County Council legislative rules and orders of compliance, and reasonable
periods and/or extensions of time if mutually agreed upon by the parties
involved. Such will be determined on a case-by- case basis.
         (Ord. 2004-596. Adopted 2-14-05; Ord. 2015-269. Adopted 8-31-15.)
 
169.12 EMPLOYEE ACCIDENTS.
   (a)    Accident Report Form.  All accidents shall be reported immediately to
the immediate supervisor. Accident report forms shall be available to all
employees.
   (b)    Completion by Employee.  Employees injured or involved in an accident
at work must complete an accident report form immediately. If this cannot be
done immediately because of the nature of the injury, employees are to complete
the accident report form as soon as possible after sustaining the injury or
having the accident. All completed forms shall be returned to the employee's
immediate supervisor and to the Department of Law and Risk Management and the
Department of Human Resources. Any employee involved in an accident while on
duty may be required to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing. Failure to comply
with any of the provisions of this section may subject the employee to
discipline, up to and including, termination.
   (c)    Completion by Supervisor. The employee's immediate supervisor shall
promptly investigate the circumstances surrounding the injury and complete the
accident report form(s). All completed forms are to be promptly returned to the
appointing authority with a copy to the Department of Law and Risk Management
and the Department of Human Resources. Failure by the Supervisor to process
timely or other actions that violate the express written terms of this chapter
will result in discipline of the Supervisor, up to and including termination.
   (d)    Workers' Compensation Form. After completing the accident report
form, employees injured at work may obtain an application for Workers'
Compensation benefits by requesting the same in person from the appointing
authority or from the Department of Law and Risk Management. All applications
for Workers' Compensation benefits shall be submitted by the employee to the
Department of Human Resources.
   (e)    Falsification. An employee who falsifies, misrepresents or makes
fraudulent statements on an accident report form or application for Workers'
Compensation benefits shall be subject to discipline, up to and including
termination.
   (f)    Medical Examination. The Department of Human Resources may require an
employee to undergo a medical examination, conducted by a licensed physician
selected by the Department of Human Resources to determine the employee's
capability to perform the duties of the employee's position. The cost of such
an examination shall be borne by the County.
(Ord. 2004-596. Adopted 2-14-05; Ord. 2011-254. Adopted 6-20-11; Ord. 2018-236.
Adopted 6-18-18.)
 
169.13 LAYOFF AND ABOLISHMENT.
   (a)    Layoff and Abolishment. Classified employees may be laid off or their
positions abolished whenever an appointing authority deems a reduction in force
necessary for reasons of efficiency, lack of funds, lack of work or other
lawful purpose. The decision of whether to lay off or abolish is at the sole
discretion of the appointing authority. The appointing authority may:
      (1)    Lay off whenever the appointing authority deems it necessary to
temporarily reduce the total number of employees for a period less than one (1)
year; or
      (2)    Abolish positions whenever an appointing authority deems it
necessary to permanently eliminate one or more positions.
   (b)    Procedure. In the event that an appointing authority conducts a
layoff or abolishment, the following steps shall be followed:
      (1)    The appointing authority shall submit to the Department of Human
Resources a statement explaining the need for the action and setting forth a
projection of the number of positions within the classification(s) to be
affected, and, in the case of a layoff, the expected duration.
      (2)    In the event of a layoff, the appointing authority shall determine
the classification(s) to be affected.
      (3)    In the event of an abolishment, the appointing authority must
identify the position(s) within the classification(s) to be affected.
      (4)    The appointing authority shall provide to the Department of Human
Resources a timetable of events setting forth:
         A.    The effective date of the action; and
         B.   The date on which notices will be sent to affected employees,
which must be a minimum of seven (7) calendar days prior to the effective date.
       (5)    The appointing authority shall certify to the Department of Human
Resources that no employee has been moved into or out of the affected position
within the preceding thirty (30) calendar days.
      (6)    The appointing authority shall provide the Department of Human
Resources with a list of affected employees, and their respective anniversary
hire dates with the appointing authority.
 
   (c)    Retention Points.
      (1)    Appointing authorities shall compute the total retention points
for each employee in the classification(s) affected by a layoff or position
abolishment. In the case of an abolishment, retention points shall be
calculated for employees in the classification in which an affected employee
may have displacement rights.
      (2)    Retention points for an employee are determined by the length of
service. Length of full-time service points shall be calculated on the basis of
one (1) point for each bi-weekly pay period of completed, continuous unbroken
service with the appointing authority. A break in service exceeding one (1)
year shall cause the employee's service date to become the hire date after the
break. Approved leaves of absence lasting no more than three (3) years are
excluded from the computation of retention points.
      (3)    Temporary employees will be given service credit only for pay
periods in which the employee worked.
      (4)    Retention points for other than full-time service shall be
calculated on the basis of one-half (.50) point for each bi-weekly pay period
of continuous service.
      (5)    The date for calculation of retention points shall be the pay
period ending date, prior to the pay period in which retention points are
received for verification by the Department of Human Resources.
      (6)    In the event two or more employees have identical retention points
as calculated by this section, the tie shall be broken by using the following
methods, in the following order:
         A.    First, employees having the most recent date of continuous
service from which no break in service has occurred shall be laid off or
displaced first; and
         B.    Second, the appointing authority shall determine the employee to
be laid off or displaced.
 
   (d)    Order of Layoff. In the case of a layoff, the targeted number of
employees in each affected classification having the fewest retention points
will be laid off. For the purpose of this section, the order of layoff of
employees in the same affected classification is as follows:
      (1)    New hire employees serving in an initial probationary period shall
first be considered.
      (2)    Interim, intermittent and student employees.
      (3)    Part-time seasonal employees.
      (4)    Full-time seasonal employees.
      (5)    Part-time employees who have not completed their probationary
period.
      (6)    Part-time employees who have completed their probationary period.
      (7)    Full-time employees who have not completed their probationary
period.
      (8)    Full-time employees who have completed their probationary period.
   The progression of layoff shall be based upon retention point order
beginning with the employee having the fewest retention points and continuing
to the employee with the most retention points. Where two or more employees
have identical retention points, the tie shall be broken in accordance with
169.13(c)(6).
   (e)    Order of Abolishment. In the case of an abolishment, the employee
serving in the affected position may displace an employee in the same
classification having the fewest number of retention points. In the event there
is no opportunity to displace an employee within the same classification, the
affected employee may displace within the next lower classification of the
classification series by displacing the employee having the fewest retention
points. In the event there is no displacement opportunity, the affected
employee's employment within the appointing authority shall be terminated.
   (f)    Displacement. Displacement rights exist only in the event of
abolishment of a classified position. Each employee in an abolished position
shall have the right to displace an employee with fewer retention points in the
same or lower classification within the same classification series.
Displacement shall be permitted only within the department or division of the
appointing authority from which the abolishment occurred.
      (1)    Notice. An employee exercising a displacement right must notify
the appointing authority of the employee's intent to displace within five (5)
calendar days after receipt of a notice of abolishment or displacement.
      (2)    Minimum Qualifications. No employee shall displace an employee in
a position requiring special minimum qualifications unless the employee
possesses the required minimum qualifications.
      (3)    Pay. An employee exercising displacement rights to a position, or
an employee displaced as a result of an abolishment shall be paid according to
the pay range assigned to the classification into which the employee is
displaced. The employee shall be assigned to a rate in the pay range which is
nearest to but not exceeding the rate at which the employee was paid in the
classification held prior to displacement. If the rate the employee was
assigned in the prior classification exceeds the highest rate in the pay range
assigned to the new classification, the employee will be assigned the highest
rate of the new classification.
      (4)    Termination. An employee in an abolished position having no
displacement right, or a displaced employee having no further displacement
right, shall be terminated.
 
   (g)    Reinstatement of Rights of Laid-Off Employees.
      (1)    Recall List. Appointing authorities having laid-off employees
shall create a recall list of reinstatement. The list shall state the
employees' names, their classifications, retention points, and date of
commencement of continuous service in descending retention point order for each
classification of layoff. The employee's name shall remain on the appropriate
layoff list for a period of one (1) calendar year from the date the employee
was first laid off.
      (2)    In the case of identical retention point ratings, the order of
recall shall be in the reverse order of layoff.
      (3)    Employees having the greatest retention points shall be recalled
first to open positions only within their department or division of lay-off,
and within their classification of lay-off. Employees must respond in writing
to a recall notice of their acceptance or refusal of the recall within seven
(7) calendar days of their receipt of notice. Failure to respond within the
time period shall result in removal of their name from the recall list.
      (4)    Employees having the greater retention points within their
department or division of lay-off shall be notified first by certified mail of
open positions within their classification series or other classifications for
which they may be qualified. Failure to respond, acknowledging acceptance or
refusal of the position within seven (7) calendar days of their receipt of
notice shall not give cause for removal from the Appointing Authorities recall
list but shall prevent further notification of open positions, other than the
classification from which they were laid off.
 
   (h)   A classified employee may appeal a layoff, abolishment or a
displacement which is the result of a layoff or abolishment, to the Human
Resource Commission. The appeal shall be filed or post-marked no later than ten
(10) days after receipt of the notice or layoff or abolishment or after the

conference and/or resulting disciplinary action. Any such representative shall
be at the employee's cost.

      (5)    Notification by employee. When an employee anticipates being
absent from work, the employee shall notify the appointing authority of the
expected absence according to the procedures established by the appointing
authority. If an employee has a prolonged illness or other reason for extended
sick leave such as death or illness of the employee's immediate family, the
appointing authority shall be made aware of this situation and the employee
shall not be required to notify the appointing authority on a daily basis of
such leave. If such notification is not made, the employee's absence may be
deemed unapproved and the employee subject to discipline, up to and including,
termination and/or the employee's sick leave may be denied.
      (6)    Evidence required for sick leave usage. The employee shall
complete, sign and return the required application for leave form. If absence
due to illness is three (3) consecutive working days, the employee shall be
required to furnish a certificate from a licensed medical doctor stating that
the employee was under said licensed medical doctor's care.

family may be required to submit every pay period, a written signed statement
to justify payment of sick leave. At the conclusion of prolonged periods of
sick leave, the employee shall submit a certificate from a licensed medical
doctor stating the employee is able to perform the essential functions of the
employee's position.
         A.    The appointing authority may require a "fitness for duty"
examination by a licensed medical doctor selected by the HRD before an employee
returns to work from a prolonged illness. If such examination is ordered, the
County of Summit will pay the cost of said examination.
         B.    Sick leave may be denied or revoked for the following reasons:

fide licensed medical doctor's certificate;
            2.    Abuse or patterned usage of sick leave; and/or

certifications for an approved sick leave for medical treatment.
         C.    The appointing authority may investigate to determine if an
application for sick leave is for a bona fide illness. Requests may be denied
or approved depending on results of such investigation.
      (7)    Overpayment. If an employee fails to submit a licensed medical
doctor's certificate or a written, signed statement verifying illness, or if an
application for sick leave is denied and as a result the employee has been
overpaid, the employee will be responsible for the repayment of the
overpayment.
      (8)    Abuse of sick leave. Any employee failing to comply with sick
leave rules and regulations shall not be entitled to sick leave pay.
Application for sick leave with intent to defraud may result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.

employee, who has separated from another public employer and becomes employed
with the County of Summit, shall be credited with the unused balance of
accumulated sick leave up to the maximum of sick leave accumulation permitted
by the County of Summit, provided that the employee has separated from the
prior employment within the last ten (10) years.
      (10)    Sick leave conversion at retirement/death. Employees at the time
of retirement from active service with the County or death shall be paid one-
half (½) of the value of their accrued but unused sick leave credit; however,
the maximum of such payment shall not exceed ninety (90) days. A retiring
employee shall submit documentation from the Ohio Public Employee Retirement
System ("OPERS") showing the retirement date of the employee with a request for
payment. Legal beneficiaries of a deceased employee shall submit a death
certificate with a request for payment.
         To qualify for such payment, employees shall have had, prior to the
date of retirement or death, ten (10) or more years of service with the County,
the State or any of its political subdivisions and meet all requirement
criteria as established by OPERS. Such payment shall be based on the employee's
rate of pay at the time of retirement or death, and shall eliminate all sick
leave credit accrued by the employee.

      (1)    Purpose. The purpose of the leave donation program is to allow

as the employee continues to make the employee's contribution to the plan.
However, those persons who fail to return to work, for reasons other than a
continued serious health condition, shall be required to reimburse the County
for the cost to the County of the insurance premiums paid for the employee's
health insurance coverage during the leave period.
      (6)    Reinstatement. Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee shall
return to the employee's original or equivalent position with equivalent
status, pay, benefits and other employment terms and conditions.
      (7)    Use of paid time off. FMLA leave shall run concurrently with any
leave. If an employee has accrued leave, that time shall be counted as part of
the twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave. Employees are required to use all
accumulated leave while the employee is on FMLA leave. Employees on FMLA leave
shall be required to use paid leave in the following order: mandatory furlough,
sick leave, compensatory leave, birthday, vacation, voluntary furlough.
      (8)    Worker's Compensation Leave. FMLA leave shall run concurrently
with worker's compensation leave unless an employee's collective bargaining
agreement specifically states otherwise.
      (9)    Spouses or domestic partners employed by the County. Spouses or
domestic partners employed by the County who are eligible for FMLA are entitled
only to a combined total of their FMLA leave for the birth of a child, adoption
or placement of a child in foster care, to care for a parent with a serious
health condition or to care for a covered service member.
      (10)    Fraudulently obtaining or using FMLA leave is prohibited. Any
employee found to be in violation of this section shall be subject to

      (11)    Administration of FMLA leave. FMLA leave shall be administered by
the Commission in accordance with the procedure adopted by the Commission.
 
   (k)    Unpaid Leave of Absence.
      (1)    An appointing authority can grant an unpaid leave of absence to
any employee for a maximum duration of six (6) months for any personal reasons
of the employee. Such a leave may not be renewed or extended beyond six months.
When an employee requests a leave of absence, the appointing authority must
ensure that such leave does not fall within existing leave policies and does
not cause a hardship to the operations of the County.
      (2)    Leave may be granted for a maximum period of two (2) years for
purposes of education, training, or specialized experience which would be of
benefit to County service by improved performance at any level; or for
voluntary service in any governmentally-sponsored program of public betterment.
      (3)    Except for emergencies, employees must submit all leave of absence
requests in writing and no later than sixty (60) days prior to the commencement
of the desired leave.
      (4)    The authorization of a leave of absence without pay is a matter of
administrative discretion. The appointing authority will decide in each
individual case if a leave of absence is to be granted.
      (5)    Upon completion of a leave of absence, the employee will be
returned to the same or similar classification held prior to the leave of
absence.
      (6)    The employee must give at least two (2) weeks' notice of his/her
intention to return to work. If an employee fails to return to work or notify
his/her supervisor in writing of his/her intentions within three (3)
consecutive working days after the date the employee-requested leave expires or
the employer-initiated leave is discontinued, he/she will be considered absent
without official leave and subject to termination.
      (7)    An employee may return to work before the scheduled expiration of
leave if requested by the employee and agreed to by his or her appointing
authority.
      (8)    Individuals who are hired on a temporary basis to fill a position
vacated by an employee who has been granted a leave of absence, shall be
notified in writing that the position reverts to the previous incumbent upon
his/her return from leave. Copy of such notification shall be made a part of
the employee's file.
 
   (l)    Administrative Leave. Administrative leave is a leave of absence
(paid or unpaid) initiated to manage special circumstances where it is in the
County's best interest to retain the employee relationship for a period of time
to be determined by the County.
      (1)    Administrative leaves may be initiated by the County, pending the
outcome of a pre-disciplinary conference and/or possibly disciplinary action,
for special circumstances that may be, but are not limited to:
         A.    Necessity to remove an employee from the work place while an
internal investigation/review ensues;
         B.    Emergency conditions where no other administrative option
exists;
         C.    Best Interest of the County - The County, upon the review of the
appointing authority, the HRD may place an employee on administrative leave
when the employee's presence in the workplace may result in damage to property,
or injury to the employee or others, or would seriously impair the operations
of the County, its morale and/or delivery of services, or it has been
determined that it is in the best interest of the County to do so. All
disciplinary procedures may be circumvented in these situations to protect
County personnel and citizens.
      (2)    The decision of whether an administrative leave initiated by the
County shall be paid or unpaid rests with the appointing authority and depends
on the circumstances surrounding the request. An employee shall retain benefits
while on an Administrative Leave. In the event the employee's pay is not
sufficient to cover the employee's portion of the premium cost, the employee
must make direct payment to the County for their portion of the premium cost
within thirty (30) calendar days.
      (3)    Administrative leave approval shall be at the appointing
authority's discretion; and in collaboration with the Director of the HRD or
designee.
      (4)    Administrative leave is not accrued.
      (5)    Administrative leaves do not qualify for the County leave donation
program.
      (6)    An employee may be separated, if during the administrative leave,
he/she accepts other employment without prior approval of the County, or files
for unemployment compensation, or if, upon return from leave, he/she refuses a
classification reassignment from the County.
      (7)    An administrative leave for investigative/review purposes shall
not be given for a predetermined length of time, but shall be in effect long
enough to conclude the investigation/review.
      (8)    Employees placed on administrative leave shall return all County
property on or before the last work day, or when commencing administrative
leave.
      (9)   Except when circumstances prevent an appointing authority from
providing prior written notice, any appointing authority placing an employee on
administrative leave shall first provide prior written notice of such action to
the Fiscal Officer. Said notice shall include the name of the employee being
placed on administrative leave, whether the leave is paid or unpaid and the
effective date the employee will be placed on leave. In the event circumstances
prevent the appointing authority from providing prior written notice, the
appointing authority shall provide the notice to the Fiscal Officer as soon as
practical, and, in addition to the information listed above, shall further
state in the notice the circumstance preventing the transmission of the notice
prior to placing the employee on administrative leave. Written notice shall be
further provided by the appointing authority to the Fiscal Officer prior to
removing an employee from administrative leave. The Fiscal Officer may
promulgate a policy or policies to implement the provisions of this subsection
that are not inconsistent with this subsection.
 
   (m)    County Emergency Leave. In the event that the County Executive
declares that a state of emergency exists in the County, such as a pandemic,
natural disaster, terrorist act or other emergency condition for which it is
necessary to close County offices, employees shall be entitled to leave with
pay until such emergency condition has ended and County offices are reopened.
 
   (n)    Paid Parental Leave.
      (1)    Purpose. Under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), employees are
entitled to twelve (12) weeks of parental leave for the birth or adoption of a
child. However, often times the leave under FMLA is unpaid, which can result in
a new parent taking an inadequate amount of leave to care for the newborn or
newly adopted child. Paid Parental Leave is intended to provide an opportunity
for County of Summit employees to take up to a maximum of six (6) calendar
weeks of continuous paid leave to provide necessary parental care immediately
following the birth or adoption of a minor child.
      (2)    Eligibility. To be eligible for benefits under Paid Parental
Leave, an employee shall:
         A.    Have been employed by the County of Summit for at least twelve
(12) months;
         B.    Have worked at least 1,250 hours over the previous twelve (12)
months period immediately preceding the date when the requested leave would
begin;
         C.    Be the biological parent of a newly born child or legal guardian
of a newly adopted child;
         D.    Reside in the same residence as the newly born biological child
or adopted child;
         E.    Be required to provide documentation of the date of birth or
adoption, as well as documentation of the parentage or adoption of the child;
         F.    Submit the request to the appointing authority on the
appropriate form at least thirty (30) days prior to the requested time off for
foreseeable leave or as much notice as is practicable under the circumstances
for unforeseeable leave.
         G.    Any employee who provides false or misleading information on the
appropriate form under subsection, F, above, or who fails to submit the
appropriate form under subsection F, above, or the documentation under
subsection D, above, or who otherwise provides false or misleading information
as to subsections, C, or D, above, shall be subject to discipline, up to and
including termination.
      (3)    Duration of Leave. An employee who is eligible for Paid Parental
Leave pursuant to subsection (2), above, may take Paid Parental Leave for all
hours of work during the six (6) calendar weeks commencing with, and
immediately following, the effective date and triggering event, as set forth in
subsection (4), below. Under no circumstances shall Paid Parental Leave be
taken beyond six (6) calendar weeks from the exact date of birth or placement
of a child for adoption. The employee may elect to utilize intermittent Paid
Parental Leave, provided, however, that the minimum amount of any portion of
intermittent leave shall be one (1) full work day, and, in the event an
employee elects to take intermittent Paid Parental Leave, the leave shall not
extend beyond six (6) calendar weeks from the exact date of birth or placement
of a child for adoption. Additionally, any employee utilizing intermittent Paid
Parental Leave must submit the request for leave to the employee's supervisor
prior to any work day where the leave will be utilized.
      (4)    Effective Date and Triggering Event. Eligibility for taking
Parental Leave shall begin on the exact date of the birth of an employee's
child or on the exact day on which custody is taken by the employee for an
adoption placement. If an employee adopts multiple children, the Paid Parental
Leave triggering event shall be considered a single qualifying event, and will
not serve to increase the length of leave for the employee, so long as the
children are adopted within six weeks of each other. If an employee is the
parent of more than one child born at the same time, the Paid Parental Leave
triggering event shall be considered a single qualifying event and will not
serve to increase the length of leave for the employee.
      (5)    Other Employee Benefits. Employees will remain eligible to receive
all employee provided paid benefits and continue to accrue all other forms of
paid leave. The employee will receive all forms of paid leave, regardless of
the pay status during the period of Parental Leave.
      (6)    Overtime/Holiday Pay/Outside Employment. Employees are ineligible
for overtime pay during the period of time they are receiving Paid Parental
Leave, and, in the event of intermittent use of Paid Parental Leave, during any
week where Paid Parental Leave is utilized by the employee. An employee shall
continue to receive their holiday pay, if they are receiving their full pay
during the Paid Parental Leave period, and if they comply with all other policy
or contractual provisions to receive holiday pay. Employees are ineligible to
hold outside employment during the period of Paid Parental Leave. Any employee
found to be holding outside employment during Paid Parental Leave shall be
subject to discipline up to and including termination. Any holiday pay received
by an employee for any work day during the six (6) week calendar week period of
Paid Parental Leave shall constitute the sole pay for the employee for those
hours worked and shall not be in addition to the employee's Paid Parental
Leave. Additionally, the occurrence of any holiday during the six (6) calendar
weeks of Paid Parental Leave shall not extend the time period for Paid Parental
Leave.
      (7)    FMLA/Paid Time Off. Paid Parental Leave shall run concurrently
with Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave, and employees using Paid Parental
Leave who meet the eligibility requirements of the FMLA shall have the entire
non-working period of Parental Leave counted towards the employee's FMLA
entitlement. Upon the exhaustion of the Paid Parental Leave Benefit, Section
169.22(j)(7) will take effect requiring accrued leave time be used. Paid
Parental Leave does not supersede or replace an employee's rights under FMLA.
      (8)    Death of an Unborn or Newborn Child. An employee who would
otherwise be eligible for Paid Parental Leave pursuant to subsection (2),
above, whose child is stillborn or dies during the third trimester of pregnancy
is eligible for three (3) calendar weeks of Paid Parental Leave following the
date of death of the unborn or stillborn child. In the event that a newly born
or adopted child dies during the period of time that the employee is on Paid
Parental Leave, the employee shall be entitled to the full extent of the Paid
Parental Leave permitted under subsection (3), above, and the Paid Parental
Leave shall not terminate due to the death of the child. All other provisions
of Subsection
169.22(n) shall apply to Paid Parental Leave granted pursuant to this
subsection (8).

    Vacation Leave accumulation shall be calculated based on Full-time

leave for the amount of hours the employee works per week. Any employee who

prorated based on the hours actually worked and/or paid leave used.
       (1)    Prior service. Prior full-time service with the County of Summit,
the State of Ohio, any political subdivision of the State of Ohio, or the
Summit County Land Reutilization Corporation shall be used in determining

of computing vacation leave.

County of Summit, the State of Ohio, a political subdivision of the State of
Ohio, or the Summit County Land Reutilization Corporation shall provide a
signed document from prior employer(s) setting forth the dates of service, the

documentation.
         B.    Part-Time Employment. Prior part-time service with the County of
Summit, the State of Ohio, any political subdivision of the State of Ohio, or
the Summit County Land Reutilization Corporation shall be used in determining

shall be prorated for all years in which the employee worked.
         C.    Calculation of Adjusted Service Date.
            1.    Employees with elected or full-time prior service or who were
paid on a salary basis will have their adjusted service date calculated as
their current hire date minus the total prior years, months and days of prior
service.
            2.    Employees with part-time prior service will have their
adjusted service date calculated as the total number of hours to equal the
total days of prior service credit to which the employee is eligible. The
adjusted service date will be calculated by counting back week days starting
with the week day immediately prior to starting employment with the County of
Summit.
      (2)    New employee. An employee with no prior service with the County of
Summit, the State of Ohio, a political subdivision of the State of Ohio, or the
Summit County Land Reutilization Corporation shall not be entitled to vacation
leave until the completion of one (1) year of service. After the completion of
one (1) year of service, such employee may use vacation as it is accrued.
      (3)    Prior service employee. An employee with approved and accepted
prior service with the County of Summit, a political subdivision of the State
of Ohio, or the Summit County Land Reutilization Corporation shall be entitled

authority.

process, vacation shall be scheduled based upon seniority within the appointing
authority's jurisdiction.
      (3)    Charging vacation leave. When vacation leave is used it shall be
deducted from an employee's credit. Vacation leave can be used in minimum
increments of one quarter hour.

in which it is accrued. However, employees may carry over accrued vacation
leave into the next year subject to the following:
      (1)    The maximum amount of vacation leave an employee may accumulate is
three (3) times an employee's annual accrual rate.
      (2)    Employees forfeit their right to take or to be paid upon

shall be forfeited.
   (d)    Payment Upon Separation. Upon separation from employment, an employee
shall be paid for any accrued but unused vacation leave not in excess of the
maximum accrual allowed. No payment shall be made to any employee having less
than one (1) year of service at the time of separation.
   (e)    Vacation Cancellation. In the event of operational or emergency need,
it may be necessary to cancel scheduled vacation leave. Such notice shall be

hardship on the department or another employee.
   (f)    Vacation/Sick Leave. If an employee, while on vacation leave, becomes
otherwise eligible for sick leave, such employee shall, upon showing of proper
evidence and approval of the appointing authority, be permitted to change such

169.28 SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION POLICY.
   (a)    Purpose. The County of Summit has a strong commitment to the health,
safety, and welfare of its employees, their families and the public. Widely
available statistics and information establish that the incidence of controlled
substance and alcohol abuse is increasing and the effect is devastating to
lives, businesses, and the community at large. The County of Summit is
concerned that, in the event of substance abuse among our employees, the safety
of our employees and the public could be endangered. Our commitment to
maintaining a safe and secure workplace requires a clear policy and supportive
programs relating to the detection, treatment, and prevention of substance
abuse by employees. It is the goal of the County of Summit to provide a safe
workplace by eliminating the hazards to health and safety created by substance
abuse. We believe this goal to be in the best interest of our employees and the
general public.
   (b)    Implementation. The County Executive is responsible for implementing
and communicating Substance Abuse policies and procedures. Any questions
regarding these policies should be directed to the County Executive and/or
designee.
   (c)    Voluntary Admission of Problem. Employees are encouraged to
voluntarily admit problems with controlled substances and alcohol prior to
violating these policies. Employees who voluntarily admit problems with
substance abuse prior to violating these policies will not have his or her
employment security or promotional opportunities jeopardized by a request for
treatment. Employees should not read this to mean that a request for treatment
will automatically excuse them from discipline or discharge where the
appointing authority initiates corrective action for violation of these
policies. Rather, an employee who seeks treatment on his or her own initiative
is in a better position than one who brings up a substance abuse problem for
the first time in response to an investigation by the County of Summit. It will
be the responsibility of the employee to comply with the County of Summit's
referral for diagnosis, and it is also the employee's responsibility to
cooperate with the prescribed treatment. An employee's refusal to accept
referral or follow the prescribed plan of treatment may be considered
insubordination. An employee who is referred to a drug rehabilitation program
and fails to satisfactorily participate in the program may be terminated from
employment. Referral to a rehabilitation program is designed primarily for
those employees who appear to have a treatable condition, not to protect those
who manufacture, distribute, or dispense drugs in the workplace.
   (d)   Applicability. This policy applies to all employees of the County of
Summit, including all levels of management while on duty, while subject to
duty, and while riding in a County owned vehicle. This policy also applies to
situations where an employee's off duty or off-premises conduct impairs work
performance. The County of Summit wants to assure that employees report to work
in condition to perform their duties safely and efficiently in the interest of
their fellow workers and the public as well as themselves.
   (e)    Violations. It is a violation of this policy to do any of the
following:
      (1)    Report to duty or remain on duty while having an alcohol
concentration from a breathalyzer test of .02 or greater;
      (2)    Report to duty or remain on duty while using a controlled
substance (including prescription drugs that impair the employee's ability to
perform the assigned duties, unless such use has been approved by a licensed
medical doctor and reported to the County Executive's designee);
      (3)    Test positive for controlled substances (a positive test is
defined as a test showing controlled substance concentrations in excess of the
threshold amounts set forth in subsection (i) of this Section);
      (4)    Possess alcohol, controlled substances or drug paraphernalia while
on duty;
      (5)    Use alcohol or controlled substances while on duty;
      (6)    Refuse to submit to a pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable
suspicion, return-toduty, or follow-up alcohol or controlled substance test.
   (f)    Consequences of a Violation.
      (1)    If an employee violates any of the policies set forth in this
Substance Abuse Prevention Policy:
         A.    The employee may be disciplined, up to and including
termination.
         B.    If the employee is disciplined in any other way than being
terminated under subsection A. above:
            1.    The employee may be reassigned.
            2.    The employee will be provided with information regarding the
services available for substance abuse.
            3.    The employee will be referred for an evaluation by a
substance abuse professional.
            4.    The employee will be subject to reevaluation, return-to-duty
testing, and unannounced follow-up testing.
      (2)    Violation of subsection (e)(6) of this Section will result in
immediate termination (See subsection (k) of this Section for definitions of
what constitutes refusal to submit).
   (g)    Legally Prescribed Drugs and Non-prescription Medications. The
appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-prescription medication is
not prohibited. However, when taking any prescription or non-prescription
medication which may interfere with the safe and effective performance of their
duties, employees are encouraged to consult their licensed medical doctor and
report such use to the County Executive's designee. Certification from a
medical doctor that an employee is able to perform the normal functions of
their position may be required before the employee will be allowed to continue
working. This requirement includes medical marijuana that has been recommended
by an authorized medical doctor, and dispensed by a licensed marijuana
dispensary in accordance with the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code and any
related regulations.
      (1)    Medical marijuana.
         A.    Any County employee who is using medical marijuana shall report
such use to the County Executive's designee, shall provide evidence (i) of the

recommendation from a medical doctor who has a certificate to recommend its
use, and (iii) that the medical marijuana was obtained from a licensed
marijuana dispensary.
         B.    An employee who has a recommendation for medical marijuana who

         D.    By an employee during the scope and course of their employment.
      (3)    Possession of medical marijuana. An employee is prohibited from
possessing medical marijuana and related paraphernalia while on County property
or in a County vehicle.
   (h)    Types of Testing for Alcohol and/or Controlled Substances.
       (1)    Commercial driver's licenses. All employees who are required to
hold commercial driver's licenses shall be subject to testing for alcohol and/
or controlled substances as required by federal and State of Ohio law.
      (2)    Firearms. All employees who are required and/or permitted to carry
firearms in the course of their employment shall be subject to testing for
alcohol and/or controlled substances pursuant to a testing program established
by their appointing authority. Each appointing authority that has employees who
are required to carry firearms shall establish a testing program and shall
provide a copy of its program's policies and procedures to the County
Executive.
      (3)    Other employees. All employees, other than those described in
subsections (h)(1) and (2) of this Section shall be required to submit to
testing for alcohol and/or controlled substances under the following
circumstances:
         A.    Pre-employment Testing: Prior to an offer of employment with the
County of Summit, the applicant for employment shall be tested for controlled
substances and alcohol. The applicant shall not be hired unless the controlled
substance and alcohol tests are negative. Any applicant who refuses a
controlled substance and/or alcohol test shall not be hired. An applicant who
is not hired due to the applicant's refusal to submit to a test for controlled
substances and/or alcohol or due to a positive test for controlled substances
and/or alcohol shall be ineligible to apply for County employment for a period
of one year.
            1.    Consent form. Prior to pre-employment testing, the appointing
authority shall present a standard form issued by the County Executive to the
applicant consenting to the pre-employment testing.
            2.    Right of appeal. If the pre-employment test is positive, the
applicant shall have the right to file a written appeal to the Commission
concerning the validity of the test. The Commission's rules concerning appeals
of employment decisions shall apply. The Commission may rule that the test is
valid or order that a second test be performed. The order of the Human Resource
Commission is final. If the test is ruled valid, the applicant shall not be
hired. If a second test is ordered and the test is positive, the applicant
shall not be hired.
         B.    Post-accident Testing: All employees who may have caused or
contributed to an accident on duty, as defined below, and where there is
reasonable suspicion of use of alcohol and/or controlled substances, as set
forth in subsection C. below, that employee will be required to submit to drug
and/or alcohol testing. The test will be administered as soon as possible after
the employee involved has received the necessary medical treatment, or within 8
hours for alcohol testing and 32 hours for testing of controlled substances. An
accident is defined as an unplanned, unexpected, or unintended event that
occurs during the conduct of County business, or during work hours, including
but not limited to, an event in the course of County business that results in:
            1.    A fatality,
            2.    Bodily injury requiring off-site medical treatment,
            3.    Vehicular damage where the driver is cited and requires the
damaged vehicle to be towed, or
            4.    Property damage.
            A positive drug test or refusal to submit to a test after an
accident may affect the employee's eligibility to receive Workers' Compensation
benefits under Chapters 4121 and 2123 of the Ohio Revised Code and may also
result in termination. An employee that tests positive for a medical marijuana
product during post-injury drug testing shall not be eligible for Workers'
Compensation even though the employee has a recommendation for that use from a
physician who is properly certified to make the recommendation.
         C.    Reasonable Suspicion Testing: A trained supervisor or official
may require an employee to undergo testing for alcohol and/or controlled
substances based upon specific, objective facts and reasonable inferences drawn
from these facts in light of experience and training. Such facts and inferences
may be based on, but are not limited to, any of the following:
            1.    Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of
controlled substances and/or alcohol use, possession, or distribution, or the
physical symptoms of being under the influence of controlled substances and/or
alcohol, such as, but not limited to, slurred speech, dilated pupils, odor of
alcoholic beverage or marijuana, changes in affect, dynamic mood swings, etc.;
            2.    A pattern of abnormal conduct, erratic or aberrant behavior,
or deteriorating work performance which appears to be related to substance
abuse and does not appear to be attributable to other factors;
            3.    An employee being charged with unauthorized drug possession,
use or trafficking;
            4.    Repeated or flagrant violations of the appointing authority's
safety or work rules, which are determined by a supervisor to pose a
substantial risk of physical injury or property damage and which appear to be
related to substance abuse or substance use and do not appear to be
attributable to other factors.
      (4)   Transportation of employee. An employee who is being tested under
subsection (h)(3)B. of this Section shall be transported to the collection
facility and then home by an appointing authority-arranged neutral third party
(such as a taxi or a designated County employee).
      (5)    Return-to-Duty Testing. Before an employee who has been found to
be in violation of this policy may return to duty, the employee must undergo
testing for alcohol and controlled substances. The results of the alcohol test
must show less than .02 concentration from a breathalyzer test, and the
controlled substance test must be negative or such employee will not be
permitted to return to duty and shall be terminated. An employee who is
terminated due to the failure of a return-to-duty alcohol or controlled
substance test shall be ineligible to apply for County employment for a period
of one year.
      (6)    Follow-up Testing. When an employee has been found to be in
violation of this policy, the employee will be subject to a minimum of four (4)
unannounced follow-up tests, in addition to the return-to-duty test, within the
first twelve (12) months following the employee's return to duty. The results
of any follow-up alcohol test must show less than .02 concentration and any
follow-up controlled substance test must be negative or such employee shall be
terminated. An employee who is terminated due to the failure of a follow-up
alcohol or controlled substance test shall be ineligible to apply for County
employment for a period of one year.
   (i)   Controlled Substance Testing Process. All controlled substance tests
and confirmation tests shall be conducted by a laboratory certified under the
United Stated Department of Health and Human Services "Mandatory Guidelines for
Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs". The County of Summit and the
laboratory shall have a clear and well-documented procedure for collection,
shipment, and accessing of urine specimens. The procedures utilized by the
County of Summit and the laboratory shall be consistent with the collection and
testing procedures established by the United States Department of Health and
Human Services and required by the United States Department of Transportation,
and shall include an evidentiary chain of custody and control and split sample
collection and testing. The collection site person is responsible for
maintaining the integrity of the specimen collection and transfer process. All
procedures shall be outlined in writing and provided to the County of Summit's
representatives and donors. There shall be a Medical Review Officer ("MRO").
The MRO is a licensed medical doctor specially trained in substance abuse
disorders. If a test is positive, the MRO gives the employee a chance to
provide a legitimate medical explanation, such as a legal prescription or
recommendation, for the positive result. If the explanation and subsequent
proof satisfy the MRO, the MRO reports a negative drug test to the County of
Summit. Each specimen will be tested for and subject to cut off levels based on
Department of Transportation regulations contained in 49 CFR Part 40. The
County reserves the right to test for additional substances at its discretion.
   The cost for all testing under this Policy is the responsibility of the
County of Summit. However, if an employee disagrees with the positive test
results, he or she may request that the sample be retested using a split
specimen from the original sample through the County's substance abuse testing
vendor. The employee is responsible for the costs associated with this
additional test. If the re-test comes back negative, the employee will be
reimbursed for the cost of the test and not be considered in violation of this
policy.
   (j)    Alcohol Testing Process. Alcohol tests shall be administered using a
breath or saliva initial screen with a confirmatory evidential breath test
("EBT") administered by a trained breath alcohol technician ("BAT") or a law
enforcement officer certified to conduct such tests. All tests shall be
administered in accordance with federal standards for alcohol testing.
   (k)    Refusal to Submit to a Test. Refusal to submit to any of the alcohol
or controlled substance tests required by this policy shall result in the
employee's immediate termination. Actions constituting a refusal to submit to a
test include:
      (1)    Failing to provide adequate breath for alcohol testing;
      (2)    Failing to provide adequate urine for controlled substance
testing;
      (3)    Engaging in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing procedure;
      (4)    Failing to remain readily available for a post-accident test;
      (5)    Attempting to substitute and/or adulterate the specimen;
      (6)    Attempting to delay a test.
   (l)    Compensation of Employees Subject to Testing. Employees subject to
random testing shall be compensated while away from duty undergoing testing
unless the result is positive. Employees subject to reasonable suspicion
testing shall not be compensated while away from the job undergoing testing or
while awaiting test results unless the test result is negative. An employee
subject to reasonable suspicion testing cannot resume their duties until the
test result is received. If a test result is positive, the employee cannot
return to work until the employee has:
      (1)    Been cleared to return to duty by the Employee Assistance Program
treatment provider; and
      (2)    A negative return to duty test result is received by the County of
Summit.
   (m)    Employee Resources. Information regarding the effects of alcohol and
controlled
substance use on an individual's health, work, and personal life, and
information about substance abuse and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation, and
employee assistance programs is available through the County Executive, and
will be periodically provided to employees.
   (n)    Confidentiality of Records. All non-DOT records relating to an
employee's testing shall be maintained as confidential medical records. DOT
records shall be maintained separately as required by DOT regulations. A tested
employee must provide written authorization before his or her test results may
be provided to any person, other than the County of Summit.
   
   (o)    Relationship to Other Provisions of Law. The terms of this policy do
not alter any employment-at-will relationship with employees. All employees
subject to this policy remain subject to all other policies, procedures, rules,
regulations, and collective bargaining agreements established by the appointing
authority under its independent authority, which are not inconsistent with the
requirements herein. All employees also remain subject to all other relevant
federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Commercial Drivers License
holders shall abide by this policy as well as the Department of Transportation
guidelines for alcohol and controlled substance testing. (Ord. 2009-331.

receiving reimbursement is not an assurance of continued employment by the
County. If an employee leaves County employment or is discharged for cause,
excluding layoff, and a repayment amount is owed by the employee, and the
employee does not otherwise repay the amount, the employee agrees to have the
repayment amount deducted from the employee’s paychecks that are issued after

County business for which expenses exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00), shall
be approved in advance by the appointing authority, provided that funds are

working days after returning from travel.
      (2)   Receipt Required. Any request for reimbursement for items over one
dollar ($1.00) shall be accompanied by original receipts and shall be attached

payment by the Fiscal Officer. Reimbursement for expenses which exceed two
hundred dollars ($200.00) and exceed the amount previously authorized by the
appointing authority in the Part I, shall be approved by the appointing
authority prior to payment by the Fiscal Officer provided that funds are
available for travel and have been appropriated as verified by the Executive's
Director of Finance and Budget. The Executive's Director of Finance and Budget
shall verify to the appointing authority whether funds are available for travel
and have been appropriated within three (3) business days of a request for
verification.
      (4)   Reimbursement Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) Or Less. Reimbursement

carrier shall be purchased through such agency. Reimbursement shall only be
made for purchase through such agency.
      (3)    "Frequent Flyer" Programs. The County prohibits the accumulation
of "frequent flyer" miles by employees earned because of County travel which is
paid for or reimbursed by the County or the County will require employees to

exceed the standard mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service,
as amended, and the Executive shall issue an Executive Order, if, at any time,
the standard mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service is
adjusted to be less than the County's reimbursement rate. Such expenses are
payable to only one (1) of the two (2) or more employees traveling in the same
vehicle. The mileage rate stated herein shall be considered as the total
reimbursement for all expenses incurred in the use of a personal vehicle except
for parking fees, ferry charges, bridge and highway tolls.
      (2)   Mileage Calculation. Mileage reimbursement shall be calculated from
the employee's normal workplace to the travel destination.
      (3)   Insurance. Employees operating a personal vehicle for work-related
purposes shall be required to maintain insurance in accordance with in Section
4509.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, as amended.
      (4)   Limitations on Mileage Reimbursement. The limit on private vehicle
mileage distance one-way shall not exceed three hundred (300) miles except
where special approval is obtained in advance from the appointing authority
after presenting good cause that is consistent with a public purpose for the
exception. Further, no reimbursement shall be granted to employees for travel
from their homes to places of work or vice versa.
   (f)   Overnight Travel. If it is necessary for an employee to stay overnight
while on County business, the employee shall be reimbursed for the actual cost
of their lodging at the lowest rate available. If a spouse accompanies an
employee, the County shall refund at the single rate only and such rate shall

Executive Order setting the effective per diem meal reimbursement rate. Such
reimbursement rate shall not exceed the per diem rate permitted by the State of
Ohio Office of Budget and Management, as amended, and the Executive shall issue
an Executive Order, if, at any time, the per diem meal rate established by the

169.31 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.
   (a)    Availability. The County of Summit has an Employee Assistance Program
("EAP") available to all employees and their families. Employees are encouraged
to utilize the EAP for any professional or personal problems they may be
experiencing.
   (b)    Referral. When a manager or supervisor observes a problem with an
employee that is affecting job performance, and feels the employee would
benefit from the EAP, a management referral may be made. Any manager or
supervisor seeking to refer an employee to the EAP shall contact the HRD. All
management referrals must be approved by the Director of HRD.
   (c)    Attendance. Any employee referred to the EAP through a management
referral is required to attend all scheduled counseling sessions and complete
the recommended course of treatment/follow-up. If the EAP counselor determines
that a fitness for duty examination should be conducted by a licensed medical
doctor, the employee shall submit to such examination. The provisions of
Section
169.32 of these Ordinances, "Fitness for Duty," shall apply to such situations,
including an employee's ability to submit to an examination by a licensed
medical doctor of their choice should they disagree with the findings of the
employer's licensed medical doctor. Failure to comply with the EAP
recommendations shall result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination.
   (d)    Discipline. Failure to meet any of the requirements of subsection (c)
may result in discipline, up to and including termination.

   (a)    Psychological Examination. The County of Summit has the right to
require an employment related physical or psychological examination in order
to:
      (1)    Determine an employees' ability to perform the essential functions
of the position;
      (2)    Identify limitations or restrictions;
      (3)    Provide a reasonable accommodation, and/or
      (4)    Determine if an employee poses a significant health or safety risk
to the employee or others.
   (b)    Administrative Leave. An employee required to obtain a fitness for
duty examination shall remain off duty until such time as it has been
determined that the employee is fit for duty. The employee shall be placed on
paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the examination. The cost of
the examination shall be the responsibility of the County. If the employee is
determined to be unfit for duty, the paid leave status shall terminate.
   (c)   Determination of Necessity of Fitness for Duty Examination. The
Director of HRD with consultation with the EAP provider if necessary, shall
determine when a fitness for duty examination is warranted, and shall schedule
all fitness for duty examinations with the appropriate certified medical
professional. The Director of HRD shall notify the employee in writing that a
fitness for duty examination is required and provide the date and time of the
examination and the name and address of the medical provider. Absent
extenuating circumstances, failure to attend the medical examination as
scheduled will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
The findings of the examination shall be sent directly to the Director and will
be maintained in a confidential medical file.
   (d)    Findings; Further Review. In the event the employee disagrees with
the conclusion of the Employer's licensed medical doctor, the employee may, at
their own expense, submit to an examination by a licensed medical doctor of
their choice in the same field of specialization as the Employer's licensed
medical doctor. Within fourteen (14) calendar days of being notified that the
employee has been determined to be unfit for duty, the employee must notify the
Director of HRD of the intent to submit to an examination by a licensed medical
doctor of their choice. The examination must take place within thirty (30)
calendar days of the employee's notification to the Director of HRD. If the
Employer's and the employee's licensed medical doctors agree, their decision
shall be final. If the Employer's and the employee's licensed medical doctors
disagree, the dispute may be referred to a neutral licensed medical doctor
agreed upon by the Employer and the employee. The neutral licensed medical
doctor shall be in the same field of specialization as the previous licensed
medical doctors, but shall not be affiliated with either licensed medical
doctor. The cost will be divided equally between the Employer and the employee.
The opinion of the neutral licensed medical doctor shall be final. The employee
may use sick leave or vacation during this period.

the Ohio Revised Code, the employee may report it to the Ohio Ethics
Commission.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in division (c) of this Section, no

provision of law, is to file an appeal with the County of Summit Human Resource
Commission within thirty days after receiving actual notice of the appointing
authority's action. If the employee files such an appeal, the Commission shall
immediately notify the employee's appointing authority and shall hear the
appeal. The Commission may affirm or disaffirm the action of the appointing
authority or may issue any other order as is appropriate. The order of the
Commission is appealable in accordance with the Human Resource Commission's

169A.01 ESTABLISHMENT OF COST SAVINGS DAY POLICIES.
   Each County appointing authority, office, agency, board and commission
(“collectively “appointing authority”) may implement a mandatory Cost Savings
Day (“CSD”) policy for its employees, consistent with the terms of this
Chapter. Unless specified or limited herein, each appointing authority shall
have the discretion and flexibility to design and implement the terms of its
CSD policy.
   Any CSD policy adopted pursuant to this Chapter that affects members of a
bargaining unit must be agreed to by the bargaining unit pursuant to a
bargaining agreement or memorandum of understanding with the appointing
authority and County.
   In addition to the mandatory CSD plan set forth herein, an appointing
authority may permit its employees to participate in any voluntary CSD policy
adopted by that appointing authority, provided, however, that to maintain their
full-time status (and the associated benefits), the voluntary CSD policy shall
limit the number of voluntary CSD hours that can be used by an employee during
the time in which he or she is participating in the Voluntary CSD policy to no
more than four hours times the number of weeks in which the employee
participates.
(Ord. 2009-379. Adopted 10-5-09.)
169A.02 USE OF COST SAVINGS DAY TIME OFF; LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF HOURS.
   As part of its CSD policy, an appointing authority may require its employees
to participate in a maximum of thirty-two (32) hours of mandatory time off
without pay ("CSD time") for the balance of calendar year 2009. The CSD time
for 2009 shall be taken between the effective date of this Chapter and December
31, 2009. An appointing authority may also require its employees with an hourly
salary of $19.23 or less to participate up to a maximum of one hundred twenty
(120) hours, and its employees with an hourly salary of $19.24 or more to
participate up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160) hours of mandatory CSD
time off without pay during calendar year 2010. CSD time cannot be carried over
into calendar year 2011 by an employee, and if not used by the employee shall
be forfeited, unless otherwise permitted by the appointing authority. In the
event of such a forfeiture, the reductions in pay set forth herein shall
continue to be applied to that employee at the same rate as if he or she used
all CSD time. The appointing authority shall establish within its CSD policy
the terms, conditions and methods by which its employees shall schedule and use
CSD time, including, but not limited to the following options:
(Ord. 2009-380. Adopted 11-2-09.)
   (a)    Designating specific days that all or some of the appointing
authority’s employees will use for their CSD time;
   (b)    Permitting employees to use their CSD time in a fashion similar to
vacation and/or comp time, by allowing the employee to select the days when CSD
time will be used;
   (c)    Designating certain County holidays that would ordinarily be paid
holidays, as unpaid holidays.
      (Ord. 2009-379. Adopted 10-5-09.)
169A.03 ADJUSTMENT OF BI-WEEKLY PAY.
   In calendar year 2009, each employee subject to a CSD policy shall have
their bi-weekly pay for each pay period from September 28, 2009 through
December 20, 2009 during which the CSD policy is in effect, reduced by a number
of hours equal to the number of mandated CSD time divided by the number of pay
periods remaining in the year when the CSD policy is enacted. As an
illustration, the following schedule is the maximum amount that each bi-weekly
pay and pay period can be reduced:
 
2009 Schedule
 
 
Pay Period          Pay Date Reduction of Hours
9/28/09 – 10/11/0910/16/09 5.33

12/7/09 – 12/20/0912/23/09 5.33
 
   In calendar year 2010, each employee subject to a CSD policy shall have
their bi-weekly pay for each pay period during which the CSD policy is in
effect reduced by a number of hours equal to the number of CSD time divided by
the number of pay periods covered by the CSD policy. As an illustration, the
following schedule depicts the number of hours deducted from each bi-weekly pay
and pay period in the event that an appointing authority enacted the maximum
amount of CSD time during the entire 2010 calendar year:
2010 Schedule
 
Number of CSD Hours Number of Pay Periods Reduction of Hours
120 Hours           26 Pay Periods        4.61
160 Hours           26 Pay Periods        6.15
(Ord. 2009-380. Adopted 11-2-09.)
169A.04 EFFECT ON SICK AND VACATION ACCRUALS, OTHER BENEFITS.
   Employees who must use CSD time shall continue to accrue sick and vacation
accruals based on their ordinary hours worked (80 hours per pay for full time
employees), and those accruals shall not be reduced or diminished as a result
of the CSD time. Additionally, service credit and entitlement to insurance
benefits shall not be reduced or impacted by the CSDs.
(Ord. 2009-379. Adopted 10-5-09.)
169A.05 EFFECT ON OVERTIME AND COMP TIME.
   CSD time taken during a pay period shall not be included as hours actually

otherwise authorized by the appointing authority.
(Ord. 2009-380. Adopted 11-2-09.)
169A.06 EFFECT ON HOLIDAY PAY.
   An appointing authority’s CSD policy cannot require an employee to forfeit
or lose holiday pay for a County holiday if he or she elects to take CSD time
on a day immediately preceding or following a County holiday.
(Ord. 2009-379. Adopted 10-5-09.)
169A.07 LIMITATIONS ON DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES.
   An appointing authority’s CSD policy may assign different employees a
different number of hours of CSD time based on job classification, funding
source and hourly rate of pay, provided, however, that:
(Ord. 2009-379. Adopted 10-5-09.)
   (a)    The number of CSD hours for any employee shall not exceed thirty-two
(32) in calendar year2009, or one hundred twenty (120) hours for employees with

employees of a certain fund cannot be assigned more CSD hours than non-
bargaining employees of the same fund;
   (c)    Within an appointing authority’s jurisdiction, lower paid employees,
based on current hourly rate of pay, of a certain fund cannot be assigned more
CSD hours than higher paid employees of the same fund.

(Ord. 2020-112. Adopted 4-27-20.)
174.03 INSTALLMENT PAYMENT AGREEMENT.
   Any owner of real property may enter into an agreement with the County
Fiscal Officer for the monthly installment payment of current real property
taxes and assessments over a period of months, as set forth herein, provided
said agreement is entered into on or before the last day that said taxes and
assessments must be paid without penalty. If the agreement is entered into

payment of both first-half and second-half taxes and assessments in equal
consecutive monthly installments commencing the 15th day of the month following
the execution of the agreement, and continuing until the 15th day of November
of that calendar year. If the agreement is entered into prior to the last day
that taxes and assessments must be paid without penalty for the second-half of
any tax year, said agreement shall provide for the payment of second-half taxes
and assessments in equal consecutive monthly installments commencing the 15th
day of the month following the execution of the agreement, and continuing until

proceeds of said fee shall be allocated to the Fiscal Officer for the operation
of the Plan and processing of agreements and payments, thereunder.
(Ord. 2020-112. Adopted 4-27-20.)

   The County Fiscal Officer is hereby authorized to waive any penalties and
interest set forth in Section 323.121 of the Ohio Revised Code and may deem
said taxes and assessments to be not delinquent, in consideration of the
agreement set forth in Section
 174.03 and subject to default as set forth in Section
 174.06, provided that all payments are timely made pursuant to the agreement.
All payments must be timely received by the County Fiscal Officer no later than
November 15th of that year for the waiver or penalties and interest to be
final.
(Ord. 2020-112. Adopted 4-27-20.)

   In the event that a monthly installment payment due under the agreement set
forth in Section
174.03, other than the installment payment due the 15th day of November, is not
paid within thirty days of the due date that said payment becomes due, said
agreement may be determined to be in default by the County Fiscal Officer. If
the installment payment due the 15th day of November is not paid on or before
that date, said agreement shall be determined to be in default by the County
Fiscal Officer. In the event of any default, any balance under the agreement
that would otherwise be due under Chapter 323 of the Ohio Revised Code shall
become immediately due and payable, shall be determined delinquent by the
County Fiscal Officer, and the County Fiscal Officer shall assess the penalty
and interest set forth in Section 323.121 of the Ohio Revised Code against that
amount. Any amount that would not yet otherwise be due under Chapter 323 of the
Ohio Revised Code shall no longer be subject to the agreement and shall
thereafter be due at and upon the time prescribed by Chapter 323 of the Ohio
Revised Code, and all applicable penalties and interest set forth in said
Chapter shall apply to that amount at the appropriate time. Nothing in this
Chapter shall limit the County Fiscal Officer's right or ability to certify
taxes and assessments delinquent at the appropriate statutory time provided
that the agreement is in default.
(Ord. 2020-112. Adopted 4-27-20.)

CHAPTER 175
Real Property Tax Escrow
175.01   Real Estate Escrow Discount Program.
175.02   Escrow agreements.
175.03   Remittance or release of escrow funds.
175.04   Relationship to other law.
 
175.01 REAL ESTATE ESCROW DISCOUNT PROGRAM.
   (a)    The Real Property Tax Escrow Fund previously established under the
County Charter is renamed the Real Estate Escrow Discount Program and shall be
operated in accordance with the County Charter and Section 321.45 of the Ohio
Revised Code, as amended.
 
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the County Fiscal Officer to administer,
accept and invest moneys properly received and credited to the Real Estate
Discount Program and to serve by agreement as escrow agent on behalf of any
taxpayer for the acceptance and disbursal of moneys as escrowed real property
tax and assessment payments.
 
   (c)    The Fiscal Officer shall invest funds received and credited to the
Real Estate Discount Program Fund. As provided in Section 321.45, the Fiscal
Officer agrees to accept prepayments and hold them in either an escrow fund or
a separate depository account until the last day that an installment of current
taxes may be paid without penalty, at which time, the Fiscal Officer further
agrees to apply the prepayments collected toward the payment of the current
taxes due on a parcel or manufactured or mobile home. If a discount is not
provided under Section 321.45(B)(2), any earning on prepayments in an escrow
fund or depository account shall be paid to the credit of a special interest
account to be used by the Fiscal Officer only for the payment of the expenses
incurred in establishing and administering the prepayment collection system
under Section 321.45(B)(1).
 
   (d)    The Fiscal Officer may extend for taxpayers enrolled in the Real
Estate Discount Program the real estate collection deadlines without imposing
the statutory ten percent (10%) late penalty for both the first and second hold
tax collections in order to comply with the statutory twenty-one (21) day
notice period under Section 323.13 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2002-660. Adopted 11-4-02.)
 
175.02 ESCROW AGREEMENTS.
   (a)    As provided in Section 321.45, the Fiscal Officer may enter into a
written agreement with any taxpayer to accept prepayments of real estate taxes
due on a parcel of real property or manufactured or mobile home listed in the
name of the taxpayer on the tax duplicate and hold them in either an escrow
fund or a separate depository account until the last date that an installment
of current taxes may be paid without penalty, at which time the prepayments
shall be applied toward the taxes due. The agreement may provide for the Fiscal
Officer to invest the prepayments held in the escrow fund or depository
account, in accordance with Chapter 135 of the Ohio Revised Code, and apply the
investment earning as a discount against the total taxes due after deducting an
amount sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Fiscal Officer in
establishing and administering the prepayment collection program. The balance
applied as a discount shall be calculated for each taxpayer’s prepayment in
such a manner that the discount credited is commensurate with the amount of
prepayment deposited in the escrow fund or depository account and the length of
time the prepayments are held for each parcel enrolled in the program.
Discounts accruing as a result of prepayments made for a tax half shall be
applied against the total taxes due for the next billable collection cycle. No
discount shall be provided to a taxpayer who fails to pay the total taxes due
or fails to make prepayments pursuant to the terms of the agreement, except for
parcels or manufactured or mobile homes with a remaining outstanding balance of
$1.00. The prepayment agreement may be made in addition to a written agreement
for the payment of delinquent taxes as provided in Section 323.31 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
 
   (b)    If a discount is not provided, any earnings on the prepayments in an
escrow fund or depository account shall be paid to the credit of a special
interest account to be used by the Fiscal Officer only for the payment of the
expenses incurred in establishing and administering the prepayment collection
system.
 
   (c)    A separate written prepayment agreement is required for each parcel
of property or manufactured or mobile home, except that a taxpayer who makes
prepayments on more than one parcel or manufactured or mobile home may enter
into a single agreement covering all of the parcels or manufactured or mobile
homes. Each agreement between the Fiscal Officer and a taxpayer shall specify
the manner in which each prepayment shall be applied to the parcels or
manufactured or mobile homes and show the date and amount of each prepayment.
(Ord. 2002-660. Adopted 11-4-02.)
 
175.03 REMITTANCE OR RELEASE OF ESCROW FUNDS.
   The Fiscal Officer may refund any amount tendered as a prepayment if, prior
to the mailing of a tax bill and escrow statement, the taxpayer or
administrator of the taxpayer’s estate so requests and files with the Fiscal
Officer an affidavit and supporting documents stating that the taxpayer no
longer owns the property, that the taxpayer has died or that another event
requiring the release of prepayment monies has occurred.
(Ord. 2002-660. Adopted 11-4-02.)
 
175.04 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAW.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be applied or construed to limit or condition
the exercise of powers or performance of duties by the County Fiscal Officer as
provided in Article IV, Section
4.01(2) of the County Charter.

177.005 PREAMBLE.
   This chapter is designed to prevent fraud, collusion, favoritism, conflict
of interest and improvidence in the awarding of public contracts. It seeks to
focus attention on the public’s interest, rather than private interests. It
embodies the belief that the public’s interest is best served where government
services and supplies are obtained through an open, public, competitive process
in which the maximum number of contractors are encouraged to participate. The
County Board of Control is designed to protect the public from abuse, enforce
this chapter with fairness and impartiality and stand guard against
wastefulness and self-dealing. The provisions of this chapter shall be
interpreted and applied with a view to promoting these overriding principles
and purposes.

designee shall serve as chair of the Board and conduct meetings.
   (c)   The Board shall meet at least twice a month in the Ohio Building.

   (h)   Definitions.
      (1)   Professional services. Professional services are services provided
by companies or individuals with expert knowledge and expertise in a highly
specialized field, wherein the work product can be defined as an intellectual
property rather than a physical asset. Professional services are normally
provided by experts with specific degrees in higher education, and/or
professional certifications. The work products of professional service
providers are reports, plans, surveys, engineering drawings, financial plans,
case work, bond underwriting and other intellectual properties. Professional
services shall also include services rendered on the development of
intellectual property and matters related to information technology and data
processing due to the specialized knowledge and expertise necessary to provide
such services. A professional service contract has a scope of work and cost
that is negotiated after selection of the service provider through the RFP
process.
      (2)   General services. General services are services provided by
companies or individuals related to the maintenance, operation, or provision of
physical assets and consumable inventories. General services also include
various personal support services provided to individuals, such as day care,
transportation, and in-home care givers. These services can be characterized as
services that are routine in nature, and require minimal training for
providers’ employees. The scope of work for general services contracts is
definable and fixed before advertising for competitive bids. Bid prices are
quoted on either a fixed cost or time and material basis.
      (3)   Sole source. A provider will be deemed to be sole source if the
following criteria are satisfied:
         A.   The product or service is the only item that will produce the
desired results or fit the defined need.
         B.   The item is verifiably available from only one source of supply.
      (4)   Best practical source. In the event there is more than one
provider, the provider can be determined to be the best practical source if one
of the following factors or other similar criteria are met:
         A.   Product availability. The vendor is the only vendor with a needed
item in stock.
         B.   Vendor proximity to the requisitioning location. When taking into
consideration the cost of travel to secure goods (such as sand, gravel,
concrete) or service (such as towing, emergency road service, emergency medical
service), the vendor offers the most economical alternative.
         C.   Timeliness of service in the event of an emergency. The vendor
can provide the fastest service or fastest product delivery.
         D.   Experience on existing project. The vendor is able to continue
providing services in an already existing program or project, implement a new
phase of an already existing program or project, or expand an already existing
program or project, wherein the vendor has already provided services for the
program or project and the vendor has developed a unique understanding of the
technical aspects of the program or project, the nature and organizational
aspects of the project and /or possesses other specific knowledge of the
program or project that other potential vendors do not possess, and the use of
said vendor for the continuation, implementation and/or expansion of the
program or project is the most expedient and cost effective decision.
      (5)   Purchase order. A legally binding document authorizing the purchase
of materials, supplies, commodities, fixtures, and furnishings. The document
certifies the availability of funds in certain accounts to pay for the items
being purchased.
      (6)   Purchase contracts. A legally binding document authorizing the
purchase of general services. Purchase contracts can also be used in situations
where the purchase of materials, commodities, and supplies has unusual
circumstances regarding quality, delivery, maintenance or other specifications
that require additional notation. The document certifies the availability of
funds in certain accounts to pay for the items being purchased.
      (7)    Purchasing Division. The term Purchasing Division as used in this
Chapter shall mean the Executive's Department of Finance and Budget's Division
of Purchasing.
      (8)    Purchasing Director. The term Purchasing Director as used in this
Chapter shall mean the employee within the Purchasing Division who oversees
purchases made pursuant to this Chapter.

350. Adopted 11-27-23.)
177.02 AWARDS.
   (a)   The Board of Control shall consider all recommendations, examine bids
to determine compliance with County ordinances, and shall award any
competitively bid contract to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. A
bidder shall be considered responsive if his proposal responds to bid
specifications in all material respects and contains no irregularities or
deviations from the specifications which would affect the amount of the bid or
otherwise give him a competitive advantage. The factors that the Board shall
consider in determining whether a bidder on the contract is responsible include
the experience of the bidder, financial condition, conduct and performance on
previous contracts, facilities, management skills, and ability to execute the
contract properly. Additionally, for construction contracts governed by Section
177.14, the additional criteria identified in that Section shall also be used
to determine whether a bidder on a contract is responsible. The Board may waive
nonmaterial irregularities, omissions or variations in any bid. The Purchasing
Director may not request the Board of Control to award a contract to other than
the low bidder unless the Purchasing Director notifies the low bidder of the
intent to do so in writing and by certified mail at least ten (10) days prior
to the meeting of the Board at which such request is made. Such notification
shall include a description of the procedures and time requirements for filing
a protest. If such low bidder files a timely written protest with Council,
Council shall conduct a hearing at which the low bidder may present evidence of
its responsiveness and responsibility. To be timely, a protest must be filed
with Clerk of County Council within five (5) days of receipt by the low bidder
of the above required notification. Furthermore, any bidder who affirmatively
acknowledges that its bid contains terms, conditions or provisions that
materially deviate from the bid specifications at the time its bid is submitted
shall not have the right to protest the award.
   (b)   Bids shall be acted on no later than sixty (60) days after bid
opening. The Board shall retain the right to reject all bids submitted. Failure
to award a contract within sixty (60) days after bid opening shall constitute
rejection of all bids unless an extension is granted by the lowest responsive
and responsible bidder with the approval of the County Executive. If the Board
rejects all bids submitted, the basis for doing so shall be entered in the
minutes of the Board.
   (c)   No award shall be made upon any bid package for a project which
exceeds, by more than ten percent (10%), the estimate certified for the project
unless County Council specifically approves such an award.
   (d)   Contracts awarded by the Board shall be submitted to the County Fiscal
Officer for certification where required.
   (e)   Contracts executed by the bidder and certified by the County Fiscal
Officer (if required) shall be submitted to the Executive for execution. Upon
execution, the contract shall be filed in the offices of the Executive. The
Executive is authorized to administer the performance of the contract, approve
payment upon acceptance, and authorize a proper warrant or warrants.
   (f)   County Council by a two-thirds majority vote of its members may debar
a vendor from consideration for contract awards upon a finding based upon a
reasonable belief that the vendor has done any of the following:
      (1)   Abused the solicitation process by repeatedly withdrawing bids
before purchase orders or contracts are issued or failing to accept orders
based upon firm bids;
      (2)   Failed to substantially perform a contract according to its terms,
conditions and specifications within specified time limits;
      (3)   Failed to cooperate in monitoring contract performance by refusing
to provide information or documents required in a contract, failed to respond
and correct matters related to complaints to the vendor or accumulated,
repeated or justified complaints regarding performance of a contract;
      (4)   Attempted to influence a public employee to breach ethical conduct
standards, or any applicable federal, state or local statute or regulation;
      (5)   Colluded with other bidders to restrain competition by any means;
      (6)   Been convicted of a criminal offense related to the application for
or performance of any public or private contract, including, but not limited
to, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of
records, receiving stolen property and any other offense that directly reflects
on the vendor’s business integrity;
      (7)   Been convicted under state or federal anti-trust laws;
      (8)   Deliberately or willfully submitted false or misleading information
in connection with the application for or performance of a public contract;
      (9)   Deliberately or willfully submitted false or misleading information
to any authorized County Official in connection with any inquiry done under
law;
      (10)   Been debarred by another county, state or by any agency or
department of the federal government;
      (11)   Violated any other responsible business practice or performed in
any unsatisfactory manner as determined by Council.
   When County Council by a two-thirds majority vote determines that grounds
for debarment exist, the Clerk of Council shall send the vendor a written
notice of proposed debarment. If the vendor is a partnership, association,
limited liability company or corporation, Council may also debar from
consideration for contract awards any partner of the partnership or the
members, officers and directors of the association, limited liability company
or corporation being debarred. When Council reasonably believes that grounds
for debarment exist, the Clerk shall send the individual involved a notice of
proposed debarment. The notice of proposed debarment shall indicate the grounds
for the debarment of the vendor or individual and the procedure for requesting
a hearing. The notice and hearing shall be in accordance with Chapter 119 of
the Ohio Revised Code. If the vendor or individual does not respond with a
request for a hearing in the manner specified in Chapter 119 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Clerk shall issue the debarment decision without a hearing
and shall notify the vendor or individual of the decision by certified mail,
return receipt requested. The debarment period may be for any length of time
determined by Council. Council may modify or rescind the debarment at any time.
During the period of debarment, the person so debarred shall not be included on
a bidder's list nor shall Council consider for a contract award any
partnership, association or corporation affiliated with a debarred entity.
After the debarment period expires, the vendor or individual and any
partnership, association, limited liability company or corporation affiliated
with the individual may reapply for inclusion on bidder lists through the
normal application process.

      (2)    Preference shall not apply as provided in this section where
prohibited by State or Federal law or regulation.
      (3)    Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a

         A.   "Disadvantaged business" means either a small business (including
a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or joint venture of any kind)

price form of contract in which the County shall be entitled to monitor and
audit all project costs.
      (13)   In establishing the schedule and process for determining a
guaranteed maximum price, the contract between the County and the design-build
firm shall comply with the following:
         A.   The guaranteed maximum price shall be based on design documents
that are no less developed than a percentage determined by the selection
committee;
         B.   The guaranteed maximum price shall be agreed to as an amendment
to the contract between the County and the design-build firm;
         C.   The guaranteed maximum price amendment shall be executed before
the commencement of any construction work; except that the County, before the
execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment, may commence construction,
so long as the County executes a separate amendment to the contract with the
design-build firm detailing the scope of work selected to commence before
execution of the guaranteed price amendment, and provided that each
subcontractor performing work shall provide a payment and performance bond in
the amount of its subcontract, which such bond shall name the County and the
design-build firm as co-obligees. The separate amendment shall state the sum
for the scope of work, which shall include the cost of the work, the general
conditions and additional fee, if any, for the design-build firm; but, any
class of work included in the scope of work selected to commence before the
execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment shall be subject to the
subcontractor selection process set forth in Subsection (d)(14), below. If a
guaranteed maximum price cannot be successfully negotiated between the County
and the design-build firm, then any subcontractor agreement between the design-
build firm and a subcontractor for work selected to commence before execution
of the guaranteed maximum price amendment may be assigned to the County or to
another design-build firm designated by the County, without the assent of the
subcontractor, and the County or the designated design-build firm and the
subcontractor shall be bound by the terms of the subcontractor agreement; and
         D.   The guaranteed maximum price amendment to the contract between
the County and the design-build firm shall include a detailed line item cost
breakdown by trade, including any cost for work selected to commence before the
execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment; dollar amounts for the
design-build firm's design and construction contingencies; dollar amounts for
the general conditions and fees, including any amounts related to work selected
to commence before the execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment; a
list of all the drawings, specifications and other information on which the
guaranteed maximum price is based; a list of allowances and statement of their
basis; a list of any assumptions or clarifications on which the guaranteed
maximum price is based; the dates for substantial and final completion on which
the guaranteed maximum price is based; and a schedule of applicable alternates
and unit prices.
         E.   The design-build firm shall provide all required performance and
payment bonds in the amount of the guaranteed maximum price within five
business days after the execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment.
         F.   If a guaranteed maximum price cannot be successfully negotiated
between the County and the design-build firm, then the selection committee may
commence negotiations with an additional proposer starting with the next
highest ranked proposer. If a contract and guaranteed maximum price amendment
cannot be successfully negotiated between the selection committee and the next
highest ranked proposer, then the County shall terminate the procurement
process and may instead procure the Construction Project under any other
project delivery method permitted by law.
         G.   Upon reaching an acceptable guaranteed maximum price amendment
with the design-build firm, the same shall be presented to the Board of
Control, who may award the same to that design-build firm, subject to
confirmation of the award by County Council. No guaranteed maximum price
amendment may be executed by the Executive without the award of the Board of
Control and confirmation by County Council. Furthermore, any amendment to the
construction contract pursuant to Subsection (d)(13)(c), above, to commence
construction prior to the guaranteed maximum price amendment shall also be
presented to the Board of Control, who may award the same to that design-build
firm, subject to confirmation of the award by County Council. No such amendment
may be executed by the Executive without the award of the Board of Control and
confirmation by County Council.
      (14)   Each design-build contract with a design-build firm shall include
terms that require the following procedures to be observed in connection with
the award of subcontracts under the design-build contract:
         A.   Prior to the award of any subcontract with an estimated
subcontract value, the design-build firm shall submit to the selection
committee for approval the qualifications that a subcontractor must have in
order to perform the work of the subcontract and a list of at least three
subcontracting firms that the design-build firm believes meets the
qualifications. The selection committee may eliminate from the list persons or
firms that the selection committee believes are not qualified, based on the
criteria mentioned in the scope of services, or to which the selection
committee has other reasonable objections. The design-build firm shall revise
the list unless in accordance with the selection committee's eliminations. The
selection committee shall inform the design-build firm of its eliminations of
any persons or firms proposed by the design-build firm, within ten working days
after the selection committee 's receipt of the list. If the selection
committee disapproves of a proposed bidder, the written notice to the design-
build firm shall set forth the selection committee's objections of the proposed
bidder(s). The design-build firm shall not solicit bids or proposals from any
person or firm to whom the selection committee has made objections.
         B.   The selection committee's elimination of any proposed
subcontractor(s) under is final and not subject to appeal except to the Board
of Control on grounds of fraud or collusion. The written Notice of Appeal shall
be filed with the Board of Control during business hours on a working day no
later than five calendar days of the design-build firm's receipt of the
selection committee's objections. If the fifth calendar day falls on a weekend
or a legal holiday on which the County is closed, the Notice of Appeal shall be
filed no later than 4:00 p.m. on the first day following the weekend or the
holiday. The Notice of Appeal shall include the appellant's allegations of
fraud or collusion with specificity. The failure to timely file the Notice of
Appeal with the Board of Control shall be considered a subject-matter
jurisdictional defect, which may not be remedied. The Board of Control's
determination of the appeal shall not be subject to any further appeals or any
other challenges.
         C.   After the design-build firm and the selection committee have
agreed upon an acceptable list of potential subcontractors, the design-build
firm shall solicit at least three competitive bids or proposals (including
design-assist bids or proposals) from subcontractors on the list of approved
subcontractors. All bids or proposals submitted shall be sealed and shall not
be opened before the bid opening date set forth in the solicitation.
         D.   On the date set forth in the solicitation, the design-build firm
shall open, in the presence of the selection committee, all bids or proposals.
The selection committee shall have the right to be present at all post-opening
scope review meetings of the design-build firm and the proposed subcontractors.
         E.   Giving consideration to the price and the qualifications of each
person or firm submitting a bid or proposal, the design-build firm shall
recommend for award the subcontractor whose bid or proposal represents the best
value, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the selection committee
with a written report setting forth the reasons supporting the recommendation.
The selection committee shall have the right to object to the proposed award if
it determines that the person or firm proposed does not represent the best
value. If the selection committee objects to the proposed award, it shall do so
by sending written notice of such objection within ten days after the selection
committee 's receipt of the design-build firm's recommendation report, and such
written notice shall set forth the selection committee 's reasons for
objecting. If the selection committee does not disapprove the bidder
recommended by the design-build firm, then the design-build firm shall award
the subcontract to the recommended bidder.
         F.   Each subcontract shall expressly name the County as an intended
third-party beneficiary with the right to sue and recover under said
subcontract.
      (15)   The Executive shall utilize the forms prescribed by the Ohio
Facilities Construction Commission for design-build projects for state agencies
in carrying out the provisions of this Subsection (d), with such modifications
as the Executive determines reasonable and necessary.
      (16)   For non-complex Construction Projects, as determined by the
Purchasing Director, the County may opt to utilize a one-step design build-
process.
 
   (e)   Construction Management-At-Risk Method. Contracts for a Construction
Project which are procured using the construction management-at-risk method
shall be procured as set forth in this Subsection (e).
      (1)   The Executive, through the Purchasing Division, shall utilize a
two-phase selection process as provided in this Subsection (e) to select a
construction management-at-risk firm to provide construction management-at-risk
services.
      (2)   Before issuing a request for qualifications, hereinafter called
RFQ, the Purchasing Director shall establish a prequalification committee for
the purpose of reviewing and evaluating responses submitted by a construction
manager-at-risk to the RFQ. The prequalification committee shall be comprised
of the Purchasing Director, the Director of Administrative Services, the Deputy
Director of Administrative Services for Capital Projects, the Director of the
Department or Division for which the Construction Project is being procured,
one (1) representative of the professional design firm, the County's project
manager if the project manager is not already listed above, and any additional
representatives of the County as may be deemed appropriate by the Purchasing
Director.
      (3)   The first phase of the two-phase selection process shall begin once
the County gives public notice of the Construction Project and solicits
responses to an RFQ from construction management-at-risk firms. The public
notice and solicitation Section shall be advertised in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county and on the County's website. The public notice and
solicitation shall be given not less than thirty (30) days before the deadline
for submitting responses to the RFQ. The public notice and solicitation shall
include:
         A.   The time and date of the deadline for receipt of responses to the
RFQ, the address of the office to which the responses are to be delivered;
         B.   If the responses to the RFQ are being procured through an online/
electronic procurement process or system, pursuant to Section
177.06(f), the advertisement shall state that the responses to the RFQ are
being received electronically and must be submitted electronically, shall state
the name of any outside online/electronic procurement process or system used by
the County and shall contain pertinent information on how prospective
responders may access and/or enroll in said online/electronic procurement
process or system to submit a response to the RFQ online;
         C.   A general description of the Construction Project and key factors
important to the final selection of the construction management-at-risk firm;

construction, construction, and post construction phases of the Construction
Project;
         E.   A general description of the anticipated schedule and estimated
construction cost for the Construction Project; and
         F.   The criteria for the selection of the construction management-at-
risk firm, including minimum experience, requirements for presentations/
interviews, and the schedule for the selection process.
      (4)   The County shall require interested construction management-at-risk
firms to submit a statement of qualifications in response to the RFQ. The
statement of qualifications shall include the following:
         A.   A cover letter or executive summary detailing the key elements
and factors that differentiate the firm from other potential qualified
responders;
         B.   Completion of a statement of qualifications similar in form to
AIA Document A305 (latest edition), listing general business information and
financial capacity such as organizational structure, licensing, experience,
references and a financial statement;
         C.   A list of all convictions or fines assessed against the
construction management-at-risk firm or any of its officers or directors for
violation of state or federal law;
         D.   Submission of a project organization chart with specific
information on key project personnel or consultants;
         E.   A letter from a surety company licensed to do business in the

         J.   the affidavit required pursuant to Subsection (f), below; and
         K.   Any other relevant information that the County determines
desirable.
      (5)   The prequalification committee shall evaluate each statement of
qualifications submitted by the construction management-at-risk firms. The
evaluation shall take into account the following factors: (i) competence to
perform the required construction management-at-risk services as indicated by
the technical training, education, and experience of the construction
management-at-risk firm's personnel and key consultants, especially the
technical training, education and experience of the employees and consultants
of the construction management-at-risk firm who would be assigned to perform
the services; (ii) ability of the firm in terms of its workload and the
availability of qualified personnel, equipment, and facilities to perform the

expeditiously; (iii) past performance of the firm as reflected by the
evaluations of previous clients with respect to such factors as control of
costs, quality of work, and meeting of deadlines; and (iv) any other relevant
factors as determined by the County.
      (6)   Out of the construction management-at-risk firms that submitted
responses to the RFQ, the prequalification committee shall select a minimum of
three (3) qualified construction management-at-risk firms to receive the
request for proposals, hereinafter RFP, unless less than three (3) firms
responded to the RFQ, in which event the prequalification committee may select
less than three (3) qualified construction management-at-risk firms to receive
the RFP. The decision of the prequalification committee shall be posted on the
County's website. Once posted on the County's website, the decision of the
prequalification committee is final and shall not be subject to appeal except
to the Board of Control on grounds of fraud or collusion. The written Notice of
Appeal shall be filed with the Board of Control during business hours on a
working day no later than five calendar days of the posting of the
prequalification committee's decision on the County's web site. If the fifth
calendar day falls on a weekend or a legal holiday on which the County is
closed, the Notice of Appeal shall be filed no later than 4:00 p.m. on the
first day following the weekend or the holiday. The Notice of Appeal shall
include the appellant's allegations of fraud or collusion with specificity. The
failure to timely file the Notice of Appeal with the Board of Control shall be
considered a subject-matter jurisdictional defect, which may not be remedied.
The Board of Control's determination of the appeal shall not be subject to any
further appeals or any other challenges.
      (7)   The County shall issue an RFP to each construction management-at-
risk firm selected to receive an RFP pursuant to Subsection (e)(6), above. The
RFP shall include:
         A.   The date, time and place for submission of proposals;
         B.   If the responses to the RFQ are being procured through an online/
electronic procurement process or system, pursuant to Section
177.06(f), the advertisement shall state that the responses to the RFQ are
being received electronically and must be submitted electronically, shall state
the name of any outside online/electronic procurement process or system used by
the County and shall contain pertinent information on how prospective
responders may access and/or enroll in said online/electronic procurement
process or system to submit a response to the RFQ online;
         C.   A clear description of the submission requirements including
separate price and technical components;
         D.   Any small business enterprise inclusion goals and workforce
inclusion goals for the Construction Project, if applicable;
         E.   The form of construction management-at-risk contract; and
         F.   Any other relevant information that the County determines
desirable.
      (8)   The RFP shall require the submission of separate price and
technical components as part of the proposal submitted in response to the RFP.
         A.   The price component shall include: (i) the fee for
preconstruction services with appropriate detail, (ii) the fee for construction
services with explanation of the basis, (iii) the estimated cost of general
conditions with appropriate detail, and (iv) the estimated construction
contingency requirements regarding the development of the GMP.
         B.   The technical component shall include: (i) a detailed project
approach, including preconstruction services, (ii) supplemental relevant
project references, (iii) the project team members with position descriptions
and relevant time commitments and billing rates of said team members during the
project, and (iv) the construction management plan indicating their approach to
controlling cost, schedule, quality, documents and claims.
      (9)   There shall be a selection committee that shall review the
responses to the RFP, and the selection committee shall consist of the same
individuals as the prequalification committee. Upon receipt of the responses to
the RFP, the selection committee shall evaluate all proposals and rank firms
based on the selection committee's evaluation of each firm's pricing proposal
and qualifications. If the selection committee elects to conduct an interview
with a construction management-at-risk firm who submits a proposal in response
to the RFP, then the selection committee shall conduct interviews with each
construction management-at-risk firm that submits a proposal to the RFP. The
decision of the selection committee shall be posted on the County's website.
Once posted on the County's website, the decision of the selection committee is
final and subject to appeal to the Board of Control only on the grounds of
fraud or collusion. The written Notice of Appeal shall be filed with the Board
of Control during business hours on a working day no later than five calendar
days of the posting of the selection committee's decision on the County's web
site. If the fifth calendar day falls on a weekend or a legal holiday on which
the County is closed, the Notice of Appeal shall be filed no later than 4:00
p.m. on the first day following the weekend or the holiday. The Notice of
Appeal shall include the appellant's allegations of fraud or collusion with
specificity. The failure to timely file the Notice of Appeal with the Board of
Control shall be considered a subject-matter jurisdictional defect, which may
not be remedied. The Board of Control's determination of the appeal shall not
be subject to any further appeals or any other challenges.
      (10)   The selection committee shall commence negotiations with the
highest ranked construction management-at-risk firm. If the selection committee
determines that negotiations with the highest ranked construction management-
at-risk firm will not result in a contract acceptable to the county, then the
selection committee shall terminate negotiations with the highest ranked
construction management-at-risk firm and shall commence negotiations with the
next highest ranked construction management-at-risk firm. The process shall
continue until the selection committee has reached an acceptable contract with
one of the prequalified construction management-at-risk firms. Upon reaching an
acceptable contract with one of the construction management-at-risk firms, the
same shall be presented to the Board of Control, who may award the same to that
construction management-at-risk firm, subject to confirmation of the award by
County Council. No contract with any construction management-at-risk firm may
be executed by the Executive without the award of the Board of Control and
confirmation by County Council. The list and ranking of proposed construction
management-at-risk firms shall be certified by the Purchasing Director and made
available as a public record after the contract award.
      (11)   Each contract for a Construction Project procured pursuant to this
construction manager-at-risk method, shall utilize a cost-plus, not-to-exceed
guaranteed maximum price form of contract in which the County shall be entitled
to monitor and audit project costs.
      (12)   In establishing the schedule and process for determining a
guaranteed maximum price, the contract between the County and the construction
management-at-risk firm shall comply with the following:
         A.   The guaranteed maximum price shall be based on design documents
that are no less developed than a percentage determined by the selection
committee;
         B.   The guaranteed maximum price shall be agreed to as an amendment
to the contract between the County and the construction management-at-risk
firm;
         C.   The guaranteed maximum price amendment shall be executed before
the commencement of any construction work; except that the County, before the
execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment, may commence construction,
so long as the County executes a separate amendment to the contract with the
construction manager-at-risk detailing the scope of work selected to commence
before execution of the guaranteed price amendment, and provided that each
subcontractor performing work shall provide a payment and performance bond in
the amount of its subcontract, which bond shall name the County and the
construction manager-at-risk as co-obligees. The separate amendment shall state
the sum for the scope of work, which shall include the cost of the work, the
general conditions and additional fee, if any, for the construction manager-at-
risk; but, any class of work included in the scope of work selected to commence
before the execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment shall be subject
to the subcontractor selection process set forth in Subsection (e)(13), below.
If a guaranteed maximum price cannot be successfully negotiated between the
County and the construction manager-at-risk, then any subcontractor agreement
between the construction manager-at-risk and a subcontractor for work selected
to commence before the execution of the guaranteed maximum price amendment may
be assigned to the County or to another construction manager-at-risk designated
by the County, without assent of the subcontractor, and the County or the
designated construction manager-at-risk and the subcontractor shall be bound by
the terms of the subcontractor agreement; and
         D.   The guaranteed maximum price amendment to the contract between
the County and the construction management-at-risk firm shall include a
detailed line item cost breakdown by trade, including any cost for work
selected to commence before the execution of the guaranteed maximum price
amendment; dollar amounts for the construction management-at-risk firm's
construction contingency; dollar amounts for the general conditions and fees,
including any amounts related to work selected to commence before the execution
of the guaranteed maximum price amendment; a list of all the drawings,
specifications, and other information on which the guaranteed maximum price is
based; a list of allowances and statement of their basis; a list of any
assumptions or clarifications on which the guaranteed maximum price is based;
the dates for substantial and final completion on which the guaranteed maximum
price is based; and a schedule of applicable alternates and unit prices.
         E.   The construction management-at-risk firm shall provide all
required performance and payment bonds in the amount of the guaranteed maximum
price within five (5) business days after the execution of the guaranteed
maximum price amendment.
         F.   If a guaranteed maximum price cannot be successfully negotiated
between the County and the construction management-at-risk firm, then the
selection committee may commence negotiations with an additional proposer
starting with the next highest ranked proposer. If a contract and guaranteed
maximum price amendment cannot be successfully negotiated between the selection
committee and the next highest ranked proposer, then the County shall terminate
the procurement process and may instead procure the Construction Project under
any other project delivery method permitted by this Section.
         G.   Upon reaching an acceptable guaranteed maximum price amendment
with the construction management-at-risk firm, the same shall be presented to
the Board of Control, who may award the same to that construction management-
at-risk firm, subject to confirmation of the award by County Council. No
guaranteed maximum price amendment may be executed by the Executive without the
award of the Board of Control and confirmation by County Council. Furthermore,
any amendment to the construction contract pursuant to Subsection (e)(12)(c),
above to commence construction prior to the guaranteed maximum price amendment
shall also be presented to the Board of Control, who may award the same to that
construction management-at-risk firm, subject to confirmation of the award by
County Council. No such amendment may be executed by the Executive without the
award of the Board of Control and confirmation by County Council.
      (13)   Each construction contract with a construction manager-at-risk
shall include terms that require the following procedures to be observed in
connection with the award of subcontractors under the construction manager-at-
risk:
         A.   Prior to the award of any subcontract with an estimated
subcontract value the construction manager-at-risk shall submit to the
selection committee for approval the qualifications that a subcontractor must
have in order to perform the work of the subcontract and a list of at least
three (3) subcontracting firms that the construction manager-at-risk believes
meets the qualifications. The selection committee may eliminate from the list
persons or firms that the selection committee believes are not qualified, based
on the criteria mentioned in the scope of services, or to which the selection
committee has other reasonable objections. The construction manager-at-risk
shall revise the list in accordance with the selection committee's
eliminations. The selection committee shall inform the construction manager-at-
risk of its elimination of any persons or firms proposed by the construction
manager-at-risk within ten (10) working days after the selection committee's
receipt of the list. If the selection committee disapproves of a proposed
bidder, the written notice to the construction manager-at-risk shall set forth
the objections of the proposed bidder(s). The construction manager-at-risk
shall not solicit bids or proposals from any person or firm to whom the
selection committee has made objections.
         B.   The selection committee's elimination of any proposed
subcontractor is final and not subject to appeal except to the Board of Control
on grounds of fraud or collusion. The written Notice of Appeal shall be filed
with the Board of Control during business hours on a working day no later than
five calendar days of the construction manager-at-risk's receipt of the
selection committee's objections. If the fifth calendar day falls on a weekend
or a legal holiday on which the County is closed, the Notice of Appeal shall be
filed no later than 4:00 p.m. on the first day following the weekend or the
holiday. The Notice of Appeal shall include the appellant's allegations of
fraud or collusion with specificity. The failure to timely file the Notice of
Appeal with the Board of Control shall be considered a subject-matter
jurisdictional defect, which may not be remedied. The Board of Control's
determination of the appeal shall not be subject to any further appeals or any
other challenges.
         C.   After the construction manager-at-risk and the selection
committee have agreed upon an acceptable list of potential subcontractors, the
construction manager-at-risk shall solicit at least three (3) competitive bids
or proposals (including design-assist bids or proposals), from subcontractors
on the list of approved subcontractors. All bids or proposals submitted shall
be sealed and shall not be opened before the bid opening date set forth in the
solicitation.
         D.   On the date set forth in the solicitation, the construction
manager-at-risk shall open, in the presence of the selection committee, all
bids or proposals. The selection committee shall have the right to be present
at all post-opening scope review meetings of the construction manager-at-risk
and the proposed subcontractors.
         E.   Giving consideration to the price and the qualifications of each
person or firm submitting a bid or proposal, the construction manager-at-risk
shall recommend for award the subcontractor whose bid or proposal represents
the best value, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the selection
committee with a written report setting forth the reasons supporting the
recommendation. The selection committee shall have the right to object to the
proposal award if it determines that the person or firm proposed does not
represent the best value. If the selection committee objects to the proposed
award, it shall do so by sending written notice of such objection within ten
(10) days after the selection committee's receipt of the construction manager-
at-risk's recommendation report, and such written notice shall set forth the
selection committee's reason for objecting. If the selection committee does not
disapprove the bidder recommended by the construction manager-at-risk, then the
construction manager-at-risk shall award the subcontract to the recommended
bidder.
         F.   Each subcontractor shall expressly name the County as an intended
third-party beneficiary with the right to sue and recover under said
subcontract.
      (14)   The Executive shall utilize the forms prescribed by the Ohio
Facilities Construction Commission for construction management-at-risk projects
for state agencies in carrying out the provisions of this Subsection (e), with
such modifications as the Executive determines reasonable and necessary.
 
   (f)   Any construction contract procured through the general contracting,
design-build or construction manager-at-risk methods, as set forth in
Subsections (c), (d) and (e), above, shall only be entered into by the County
with a responsible firm. In order for any firm to be considered a responsible

the County's liability upon that Note to the extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
(Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.07 SIGNING AND AUTHENTICATION OF THE NOTES.
   (a)   Unless otherwise provided in a Resolution, the Notes must be signed by
the County Executive and the County Fiscal Officer, in the name of the County
and in their official capacities. In the absence of the County Executive, the
Director of the Department of Finance and Budget may sign the Notes with the
County Fiscal Officer, and in the absence of the County Fiscal Officer, any
Deputy Fiscal Officer may sign the Notes. Any of those signatures may be a
facsimile.
   (b)   No Note will be valid or obligatory for any purpose or will be
entitled to any security or benefit under the Note Proceedings unless and until
the certificate of authentication printed on the note certificate is signed by
the Registrar as authenticating agent. Authentication by the Registrar will be
conclusive evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly issued,
signed, and delivered under, and is entitled to the security and benefit of,
the Note Proceedings. The certificate of authentication may be signed by any
authorized officer or employee of the Registrar or by any other person acting
as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Authorized Officer on behalf
of the County. The same person need not sign the certificate of authentication
on all of the Notes.
(Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.08 REGISTRATION; TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE; BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.
    Unless otherwise provided in the Note Resolution, or in a Registrar
Agreement entered into in accordance with a Note Resolution, the Notes will
have the following provisions relating to registration, transfer, exchange, and
Book-Entry Form.
   (a)    Registration. So long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the
County will cause the Registrar to maintain the Register. Subject to the
provisions of Section
190.10, the person in whose name a Note is registered on the Register will be
regarded as the absolute owner of that Note for all purposes of the Note
Proceedings. Neither the County nor the Registrar will be affected by any
notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in this
Section and in the Registrar Agreement.
   (b)    Transfer and Exchange.  Any Note may be exchanged for Notes of any
Authorized Denomination upon presentation and surrender at the office of the
Registrar, together with a request for exchange signed by the registered Holder
or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Register upon presentation and
surrender of the Note at the office of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered Holder or by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer, the
Registrar will complete, authenticate, and deliver a new note certificate of
any Authorized Denomination requested by the Holder equal to the unmatured
principal amount of the Note surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate
and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of the County are required, the Registrar will
undertake the exchange or transfer of a Note only after the new Note is signed
by the authorized officers of the County. In all cases of Notes exchanged or
transferred the County will sign and the Registrar will authenticate and
deliver Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Note Proceedings. The
exchange or transfer will be without charge to the Holder, except that the
County and the Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer.
The County or the Registrar may require that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for the exchange or transfer. All Notes issued
and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer will be valid obligations of
the County, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same security and
benefit under the Note Proceedings as the Notes surrendered upon that exchange
or transfer. Neither the County nor the Registrar will be required to make any
exchange or transfer of any Note selected for redemption, in whole or in part.
   (c)    Book-Entry System. The Notes must be originally issued in Book-Entry
Form to a Depository, initially The Depository Trust Company, for use in a
Book-Entry System upon the terms provided in the Registrar Agreement. Under the
Book-Entry System, the Notes will be registered in the name of a Depository or
its nominee, the note certificates in fully-registered form will be deposited
with and retained in the custody of the Depository or its agent, and the
ownership of interests in the Notes may be transferred only through a book
entry on the records of the Depository.
Subject to the provisions of the Note Proceedings relating to the County's
Continuing Disclosure Agreement, the County and the Registrar must recognize
and treat the Depository as the Holder of the Notes for all purposes, including
payment of Debt Service, redemption and other notices, and enforcement of
remedies.
If any Depository determines not to continue to act as a Depository for the
Notes for use in a Book-Entry System or if the County determines to discontinue
the Book- Entry System, the Authorized Officer may attempt to establish a
securities depository/book-entry relationship with another qualified
Depository. If the Authorized Officer does not or is unable to do so, the
County Executive must direct the Registrar to make provision for notification
of the book-entry interest owners by the Depository and to make any other
arrangements necessary for the withdrawal of the Notes from the Book-Entry
System.
      (Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.09 SALE OF THE NOTES.
   (a)   The Notes must be sold according to the terms and conditions set forth
in each Note Resolution. The purchase price must not be less than ninety-seven
percent (97%) of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued interest
on the Notes from their date to the Closing Date.
   (b)   The Authorized Officer must sign the Certificate of Award and must
cause the Notes to be prepared, signed, and delivered, together with a true
transcript of proceedings of the issuance of the Notes, to the Original
Purchaser upon payment of the purchase price.

190.10 DISCLOSURE.
   This Section will apply to an issue of Notes only to the extent specifically
adopted in a Note Resolution.

official statement and any supplements in connection with the original issuance
of the Notes, and

certificates, statements, or other documents in connection with the finality,
accuracy, and completeness of that official statement.
(b)    Secondary Market Disclosure-Continuing Disclosure Agreement. For the
benefit of the Holders of the Notes and the beneficial owners of the Notes, the
County shall agree, as the only obligated person with respect to the Notes
under the SEC Rule, to provide financial information and operating data,
financial statements, and notices, in the manner required for purposes of
paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the SEC Rule.
(1)    Information filing. The County further agrees, in particular, to
provide:
A.   To each NRMSIR and to the SID:
   1.   Annual Information for each County fiscal year not later than nine
months following the end of the fiscal year, and
   2.   When and if available, audited County financial statements for each of
those fiscal years;
B.    To each NRMSIR or to the MSRB, and to the SID, in a timely manner, notice

   2.   The County's failure to provide the Annual Information within the time
specified above, and
   3.   Any change in the accounting principles applied in the preparation of
its annual financial statements, any change in its fiscal year, its failure to
appropriate funds to meet costs to be incurred to perform the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, and the termination of the Continuing Disclosure
Agreement; and
C.   If the filing is due after the effective date of the EMMA System, to EMMA,
in a timely manner, the filings required by subsections (b)(1) A. and B.
hereof, to the extent required by the SEC Rule. The filings required by
subsections (b)(1) A. and B. hereof need not be made with the NRMSIRs, SID, or
MSRB to the extent that filing with the EMMA System is sufficient under the SEC
Rule.
(2)    Continuing disclosure certificate. To further describe and specify
certain terms of the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, the Authorized Officer
shall:
   A.   Complete, sign, and deliver the Continuing Disclosure Certificate, in
the name and on behalf of the County and
   B.   To specify in reasonable detail the Annual Information to be provided
(which may be provided by specific reference to other documents previously
filed and available in accordance with the SEC Rule), whether the County has
obtained any credit enhancement for the Notes, and the County's expectations as
to whether audited financial statements will be prepared, the accounting
principles to be applied in their preparation, and whether they will be
available together with, or separately from, the Annual Information.
(3)    Disclosure procedures. The Authorized Officer shall establish procedures
to ensure compliance by the County with the Continuing Disclosure Agreement,
including timely provision of information and notices as described above.
Before making any filing in accordance with subsection (b)(2) hereof or
providing notice of the occurrence of any other events, the Authorized Officer
may consult with and obtain legal advice from bond counsel or other qualified
independent special counsel selected by the County. The Authorized Officer,
acting in the name and on behalf of the County, may rely upon that legal advice
in determining whether a filing should be made.
(4)    Amendments. The County reserves the right to amend the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, and to obtain the waiver of noncompliance with any
provision of the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, as may be necessary or
appropriate to achieve its compliance with any applicable federal securities
law or rule, to cure any ambiguity, inconsistency, formal defect, or omission,
and to address any change in circumstances arising from a change in legal
requirements, change in law, or change in the identity, nature, or status of
the County. Any amendment or waiver will not be effective unless the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement (as amended or taking into account that waiver) would have
complied with the requirements of the SEC Rule at the time of the primary
offering of the Notes, after taking into account any applicable amendments to
or official interpretations of the SEC Rule, as well as any change in
circumstances, and until the County has received either:
   A.   A written opinion of bond counsel or other qualified independent
special counsel selected by the County that the amendment or waiver would not
materially impair the interests of Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes,
or
   B.   The written consent to the amendment or waiver by the Holders of at
least a majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.
   Annual information containing any revised operating data or financial
information must explain, in narrative form, the reasons for any amendment or
waiver and the impact of the change on the type of operating data or financial
information being provided.
(5)    Enforcement. The Continuing Disclosure Agreement will be solely for the
benefit of the Holders and beneficial owners from time to time of the Notes.
   The exclusive remedy for any breach of the Continuing Disclosure Agreement
by the County will be limited, to the extent permitted by law, to a right of
Holders and beneficial owners to institute and maintain proceedings authorized
at law or in equity to obtain the specific performance by the County of its
obligations under the Continuing Disclosure Agreement. Any individual Holder or
beneficial owner may institute and maintain those proceedings to require the
County to provide a pertinent filing if the filing is due and has not been
made. Any proceedings to require the County to perform any other obligation
under the Continuing Disclosure Agreement (including any proceedings that
contest the sufficiency of any filing) may be instituted and maintained only:
   A.   By a trustee appointed by the Holders and beneficial owners of not less
than twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the issue of Notes then
outstanding, or
   B.   By Holders and beneficial owners of not less than ten percent (10%) in
principal amount of the issue of Notes then outstanding, in accordance with
Section 133.25(B)(4)(b) or (C)(l) of the Ohio Revised Code, as applicable (or
any successor provisions).

Disclosure Agreement will be subject to the annual appropriation of any funds
that may be necessary to perform it.
(7)    Term. The Continuing Disclosure Agreement will remain in effect only for
the period that the Notes are outstanding in accordance with their terms and
the County remains an obligated person with respect to the Notes within the
meaning of the SEC Rule. The obligation of the County to provide the Annual
Information, audited financial statements, and notices of the events described
above will terminate if and when the County no longer remains an obligated
person with regard to the Notes.
   (Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.11 FINANCING COSTS.
   By adoption of a Note Resolution Council will authorize the payment of the
Financing Costs for the Notes, as provided in this Section. The County shall
retain bond counsel in connection with the County's bonds and notes issued
under the Note Program. The County will designate any other necessary service
providers, including underwriters and registrars, in the Note Resolution.
(a)    Registrar. The Registrar must perform the services as bond registrar,
authenticating agent, paying agent, and transfer agent for the Notes as
provided in the Note Proceedings. The Registrar must be paid for those services
in accordance with the Registrar Agreement.
(b)    Ratings and Insurance. If, in the judgment of the Authorized Officer,
the filing of an application for:
   (1)    A rating on the Notes by one or more nationally-recognized
statistical rating organizations, or
   (2)    A policy of insurance to better assure the payment of principal of
and interest on the Notes,
is in the best interest of and financially advantageous to the County, the
Authorized Officer must prepare and submit those applications and provide to
each of those organizations or insurance companies the information required for
the purpose. The fees for those ratings and the premiums for the insurance
shall be included in Financing Costs authorized under Section
190.11 (d) below.
(c)    Limits on Authority of Service Providers. In rendering services in
connection with an issue of Notes, as independent contractors, those service
providers must not exercise any administrative discretion on behalf of the
County in the formulation of public policy; expenditure of public funds;
enforcement of laws, rules and regulations of the State of Ohio, the County, or
any other political subdivision; or the execution of public trusts.
(d)    Payment of Financing Costs. By adoption of the Note Resolution, Council
will authorize and approve the expenditure of the amounts necessary to pay the
Financing Costs specifically authorized above and all other necessary Financing
Costs in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes. Those Financing
Costs may be paid by the Original Purchaser. To the extent they are not paid by
the Original Purchaser, the Authorized Officer shall provide for the payment of
those Financing Costs from the proceeds of the Notes to the extent available
and, otherwise, from any other funds lawfully available and appropriated for
the purpose.
   (Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.12 USE OF NOTE PROCEEDS.
   Any accrued interest or premium received on the sale of the Notes must be
deposited in the Bond Retirement Fund of the County and be used for the payment
of interest on the Notes at their maturity. The remainder of the proceeds must
be used as provided in each Note Resolution.
(Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.13 SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT.
   (a)    The Notes will be general obligations of the County.
   (b)    By adoption of the Note Resolution, Council will pledge to the
payment of Debt Service on the Notes the full faith and credit of the County
including, without limitation:
(1)    The general taxing power of the County, including the power to levy
taxes within the ten-mill limitation, as defined in Section 5705.02 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
(2)    The proceeds to be received from the sale of any notes issued to refund
the Notes and of the Bonds in anticipation of which the Notes are issued.
(3)    Any money remaining from the sale of the Notes and not required for the
payment of costs of the Projects or the payment of Debt Service on maturing
notes.
   (c)    The Debt Service on the Notes must be paid at their maturity from any
of the amounts set forth above pledged to their payment, or any funds of the
County otherwise available for their payment.
   (d)    During the years while the Notes are outstanding, there will be
levied on all the taxable property in the County, in addition to all other
taxes, a direct tax annually, subject to tax limitations, not less than the tax
that would have been levied had the Bonds been issued without the prior issue
of the Notes. The tax must be and is ordered to be computed, certified, levied,
and extended upon the tax list and collected by the same officers, in the same
manner and at the same time that taxes for general purposes for each of those
years are computed, certified, levied, extended, and collected. The tax must be
placed before and in preference to all other items and for its full amount. The
money derived from that tax levy must be placed in the Bond Retirement Fund of
the County and is irrevocably pledged for the payment of the Debt Service on
the Notes, when and as that Debt Service falls due. If any of the following
amounts are available for the payment of the Notes and are appropriated for
that purpose, the amount of the tax levy in each year must be reduced by the
amount available and appropriated:
(1)   Any surplus in the Bond Retirement Fund.
(2)    Proceeds received from the sale of the Bonds or any notes issued to
refund or renew the Notes.
(3)   Any source of payment designated in the Note Resolution.
(4)    Any other money lawfully available to the County.
   (Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.14 FEDERAL TAX MATTERS.
   This Section will apply to an issue of Notes only to the extent specifically
adopted in a Note Resolution. By adoption of a Note Resolution, the County will
covenant that it will take those actions required to maintain the Federal Tax
Status on the Notes and that it will not take or permit to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that Federal Tax Status. Without limiting these
covenants, the County will specifically covenant as follows:
(a)    Private Activity Bonds. The County will apply the proceeds received from
the sale of the Notes to pay costs of the Projects or, for renewal notes, to
pay Debt Service on the maturing notes, and to pay the Financing Costs in
connection with the Notes. The County will not permit the use of the Projects
by any person, will not secure or derive the money for payment of Debt Service
on the Notes by any property or payments, and will not loan the proceeds of the
Notes to any person, all in a manner as to cause the Notes to be "private
activity bonds" within the meaning of Code Section l41(a).
(b)    Arbitrage. The County will restrict the use of proceeds of the Notes in
the manner and to the extent as may be necessary, after taking into account
reasonable expectations at the time of the delivery of and payment for the
Notes, so that the Notes will not constitute "arbitrage bonds" within the
meaning of Code Section 148. The Authorized Officer or any other official
having responsibility for issuing the Notes, is authorized and directed, alone
or in conjunction with any other officer, employee, or consultant of the
County, to sign and deliver a certificate of the County, for inclusion in the
transcript of proceedings for the Notes, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the County on the Closing Date, regarding the amount and use of
the proceeds of the Notes in accordance with Code Section 148. If required, the
County will limit the yield on any "investment property" (as defined in Code
Section l48(b)(2)) acquired with the proceeds of the Notes.
(c)    Arbitrage Rebate. Unless the gross proceeds of the Notes are expended in
accordance with one of the spending period exceptions set forth in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.148-7, the County will pay the amounts required by Code Section 148(f)(2)
to the United States at the times required by Code Section 148(f)(3). The
County will maintain the books and records and make the calculations and
reports that are required to comply with the Code's arbitrage rebate
requirements.
(d)    Federal Guarantee. The County will not permit the use of the Projects,
or make loans of the proceeds of the Notes, or invest the proceeds of the Notes
in a manner as to cause the Notes to be "federally guaranteed" within the
meaning of Code Section 149(b).
(e)    Information Reporting. The Authorized Officer or any other official of
the County having responsibility for issuing the Notes shall sign and file a
Form 8038-G for the Notes with the Internal Revenue Service.
(f)    Bank-Qualified Obligations. Each Note Resolution will determine if an
issue of Notes constitutes a "qualified tax-exempt obligation" for the purposes
of Code Section 265(b)(3).
      (Ord. 2009-139. Adopted 4-13-09.)
190.15 SIGNING AND DELIVERY OF NOTES AND DOCUMENTS.
   (a)    By adoption of a Note Resolution, Council will authorize and direct

Director of the Department of Finance and Budget and any Deputy Fiscal Officer,
to sign and deliver the Notes in accordance with Section
190.07 of this chapter.

authorized and directed to sign and deliver, on behalf of the County, in his
capacity as fiscal officer of the County:

Code, required for any of the agreements in connection with the Notes.
(2)    The statements of indebtedness provided for in Section 133.33(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code.

reasonable grounds to believe an unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable consumer
sales practice has occurred, the Office must attempt to mediate the matter with

occurred, the Deputy Director may then refer the matter to the Ohio Attorney
General's Office, the Ohio Department of Commerce, the Federal Trade Commission
or other appropriate person for suitable action if necessary.
   (b)    If the Office is unable to reconcile the parties' differences
concerning any complaint of unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable consumer sales

appropriate, the Deputy Director may refer a complaint to an appropriate person
including but not limited to the following: the Consumer Protection Division of
the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Ohio Department of Commerce, the

that a complaint is not susceptible of mediation, the Deputy Director may
transmit the matter to the County Prosecutor, or other appropriate person for
suitable action. In addition to recovery of fines, as provided by the Codified
Ordinances of the County of Summit and the Ohio Revised Code, actions may be
brought for injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to
restrain a person from violating applicable law and to restrain a person from
engaging in unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable consumer sales practices.
   (e)    If the Deputy Director finds that a complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation, the Deputy Director may dismiss the
complaint or order further investigation.
   (f)    Nothing in this Section prevents any person from exercising any right
or seeking any remedy to which the person might otherwise be entitled, or from
filing any complaint with any other person, agency or court.

Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of

shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or

triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.

affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.

fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the County at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the County, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal or County corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the County may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or
portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices.
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red "X": A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

"walk" or "don't walk", or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes "walk",
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes "don't
walk", means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word "wait" if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this
division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would
be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under
this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved
by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, "emergency
medical technician-intermediate" and "emergency medical technician-paramedic"
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person's expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
"national highway traffic safety administration" means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
(ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
 
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers' intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers' intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers'
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers' intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender's progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days

drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers' intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers' intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers' intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers'
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers' intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender's progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The courtmay impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
               In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with
electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of
monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed
by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider. The
purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the offender's alcohol
usage and to determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request
of the court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment
to the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses
related to alcohol use.

subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this County unless the person has a
valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a commercial
driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this County unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial
driver's license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
         The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent County ordinance,
the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender's restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent County ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent County
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent County ordinance, and if the offender's license was expired for more
than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class seven
suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02.

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
 
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender's control is in a
category described in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section

license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent County ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to the
state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
            If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for
criminal forfeiture under this subsection is assigned or transferred and
division (B)(2) or (3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the

subsection shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4503.234.
 
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)

subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.

involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the conviction,
plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment of a motor
vehicle.

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

vehicle's license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender's name and if,

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
 
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order

registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
 
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

379.02 OPERATING REGULATIONS.
   The following rules for preventing collisions shall be followed in the
navigation of all watercraft operating upon the waters within the County:
   (a)   Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail alone shall be
considered a sailboat. Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail
and machinery shall be considered a powercraft. Every watercraft shall be
considered under way when it is not at anchor or made fast to the shore or
aground. In addition to any other situation, risk of collision shall be
determined to exist whenever the compass bearing of the approaching watercraft
remains substantially the same.
   (b)   When two sailboats are approaching one another so as to involve the
risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other, as
follows:
      (1)   When one sailboat has the wind on the port side and the other has
the wind on the starboard side, the sailboat with the wind on the port side
shall keep out of the way of the sailboat with the wind on the starboard side.
      (2)   When both sailboats have the wind on the same side, the sailboat
which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the sailboat which is to
the leeward.
      (3)   When a sailboat with the wind on the port side sees a sailboat to
windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other sailboat has the
wind on the port or the starboard side, it shall keep out of the way of the
other sailboat.
   (c)   When two powercraft are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal
courses, so as to involve the risk of collision, each shall alter its course to
starboard, so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.
   (d)   When two powercraft are crossing at right angles or obliquely, so as
to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft which has the other on its own
starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if possible, avoid crossing
ahead of the other.
   (e)   When a powercraft and a sailboat are proceeding in such directions as
to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft shall yield the right of way
to the sailboat, except when the sailboat is overtaking the powercraft.
   (f)   Every watercraft which is directed by these rules to yield the right
of way to another watercraft shall, on approaching such other watercraft, if
necessary, slacken its speed, stop, reverse or alter course. Where, by any of
the rules prescribed hereunder, one (1) of two (2) watercraft shall yield the
right of way, the other shall keep its course and speed.
   (g)   Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, every watercraft
overtaking another shall yield the right of way to the overtaken watercraft.
Every watercraft coming up with another watercraft from any direction more than
twenty-two and one-half (22-1/2) degrees abaft the other's beam, that is, at
such a position with reference to the watercraft which it is overtaking that at
night it would be unable to see either of the other's side or combination bow
lights, is an overtaking watercraft; and no subsequent alteration of bearing
between the two (2) watercraft shall make the overtaking watercraft a crossing
watercraft within the meaning of these rules, or relieve it of the duty of
keeping clear of the overtaken watercraft until it is finally passed and clear.
If the overtaking watercraft is in doubt as to whether it is forward of or
abaft this direction from the other watercraft, it should assume that it is an
overtaking watercraft and yield the right of way.
   (h)   In rivers and streams or other areas in which there is a water
current, the descending watercraft shall have the right of way over a
watercraft which is ascending.
   (i)   When a powercraft and a row boat are proceeding in such direction as
to involve the risk of collision, such powercraft shall yield the right of way
to such row boat.
   (j)   Watercraft leaving a dock, boat slip or tie-up space shall yield the
right of way to all watercraft approaching such dock, boat slip or tie-up
space.
   (k)   At all times the operator of a watercraft shall maintain a proper
lookout required by the ordinary practice of seamen and by the special
circumstances of the case.
   (l)   In obeying and construing these rules, due regard shall be had to all
dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances which may
render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate
danger.
      (Ord. 88-453. Approved 8-16-88.)
379.03 MOVEMENT ON CRAFTS UNDERWAY.
   (a)   No occupant of any watercraft under way upon the waters within the

division (e)(1)A. or B. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
      (2)   Division (e)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a court,
in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (e)(1) of this section.

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant or child to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's or child's
attorney or, if the defendant or child has no attorney, on the defendant or
child.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
County for purposes of this section.
   (d)    When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this County for an offense committed or completed outside of this County, the
person is subject to all specifications for that offense that would be
applicable if the offense had been committed within this County.
   (e)    Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An "offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant" includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
 
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
 
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
 
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   "Intoxication" includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
 
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused's entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person's identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
 
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.

specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
 
"The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice's complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness' credibility and make the witness' testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the
witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth".
      (3)   "Conspiracy", as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.

      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor's abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor's participation in the conspiracy.
 
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
 
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
 
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for

of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if

license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

for a subsequent offense, the previous enhancing offense shall include an
identical or substantially similar offense brought under provisions of the Ohio

only to the extent of conflict. Provisions of identical or substantially
identical offenses or differences in penalties provided for an offense shall
not be construed as a conflict.
501.98 PAYMENT OF FINES TO COUNTY FISCAL OFFICER.
   All fines levied under this General Offenses Code shall be paid by the clerk

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this section. The notice
shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
appropriate court having territorial jurisdiction over the dog's owner, keeper,
or harborer.

dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as applicable, until the court makes a final
determination and during the pendency of any appeal.

dog, then division (b)(3) of Section

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

each vendor shall maintain and keep complete and accurate records of rents,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall include:
      (1)    Primary records such as all guest or rent registers, rent
invoices, statements or bills, rent payments and/or refunds thereon, room rate
sheets or cards of prices per day of each room as required by Section 3731.16
of the Ohio Revised Code, as amended, receipts of taxes collected, copies of
the appropriate schedule of Federal income tax returns, Ohio sales tax returns
and tax returns to local subdivisions having a lodging excise tax identical or
substantially similar to the tax imposed hereby, as filed by the vendor,
exemption certificates, tax payment receipts, cash register tapes and all other
pertinent documents; and
      (2)    Secondary records such as bank deposit receipts and day books,
journals, or any other records in which is accumulated data by the vendor,
which must be supported by complete detailed records from which such data was
accumulated.
   (b)    Guest or rent invoices, statements or bills and cash register tapes
for taxable rents must have the total taxable rent and the tax charged and/or
collected separately stated thereon, which amounts are to be accumulated and
recorded in a secondary record.
   (c)    Rent invoices, statements or bills shall all clearly show the length
of stay, in terms of consecutive days, for each guest.

timely and complete filings and payment of lodging taxes.
   (e)    All such records shall be open during regular business hours for
inspection by the Fiscal Officer or designee, who shall review, investigate,
examine and audit any such records at the Fiscal Officer's discretion. In
connection with such investigation, he may interview the vendor, his agents and
employees and take written statements under oath pursuant to the power
conferred by Section 305.21 of the Ohio Revised Code, as amended, and the
County of Summit Charter. If the investigation reveals that any tax should have
been remitted by the vendor, he shall make a tax assessment in the manner
provided in subsection (g) hereof, provided that the Fiscal Officer is
satisfied that the failure to return such tax or additional tax when due was
caused by unintentional or immaterial error, mistake or omission, he shall not
impose the penalty.
(Ord. 2005-563. Adopted 11-7-05.)
   (f)    If any vendor fails to maintain complete primary sales records,
accurately reflecting the total rents subject to the tax or which may be used
to verify the accuracy of secondary records or reported on his tax returns, the
Fiscal Officer, based upon any information in his possession, will use one of
the following methods for such verification:
      (1)    Determine the total amount of all rents, less rental refunds when
the full tax has also been refunded either in cash or by credit; or
      (2)    Determine taxable and nontaxable rents, or the ratio of taxable
rents to total rents, or both.
   The above described determinations may be based upon a sampling or test
checks of the vendor's business activity for a representative period, or other
information relating to the rental of rooms made by such vendor. The Fiscal
Officer may make the same determination where the facts in his possession
reasonably lead him to believe that the amount of tax required to be collected
is or should be greater than the amount remitted by the vendor.
(Ord. 2005-640. Adopted 12-19-05.)
    (g)    (1)    If any vendor engages in the following forms of bad faith
conduct:
         A.    Fails to maintain complete records; or
          B.    Fails or refuses to permit the Fiscal Officer or designee to
inspect any records; or
         C.    Refuses to permit the Fiscal Officer or designee to sample or
test check his business activity; or
         D.     Having filed a return or returns, misrepresents or fails to
disclose, any material fact or figure thereon; or
         E.    Fails to collect the tax, or having collected the tax, fails to
remit the same when due; or
         F.    Fails to remit the correct amount of tax when due; or
         G.    Fails to file a full and complete return when due; then
      (2)    The Fiscal officer shall determine the proper amount of tax by any
of the means set forth herein:
         A.    The tax shall be deemed to be the tax collected, or that should
have been collected, by such vendor during the entire period of time under
review; and
         B.    The Fiscal Officer shall make an assessment of such amount of
tax and delinquency penalties based upon such determination, less the tax paid
during such period, if any:
            1.    Plus an additional penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the
total amount of the assessment for conduct described in (g)(1)A., B., C., D.,
F. or G. of this section; or
            2.    Plus an additional penalty of fifty percent (50%) of the
total amount of the assessment for conduct described in (g)(1)E. of this
section.
   (h)    No delinquent tax, however, shall be assessed against a vendor or
consumer more than four years after the return date for the period in which the
taxable transaction occurred, or after the return for such period was filed,
whichever is later.
   (i)    All returns, documents and payments submitted by each vendor, all
records and other documents examined and all information or knowledge of any
vendor's business obtained by the Fiscal Officer shall be treated
confidentially by the Fiscal Officer and shall not be released except as
required by law.
(Ord. 2005-563. Adopted 11-7-05.)
703.08 PROCEDURE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT; APPEALS.
   (a)    Each delinquent tax assessment shall be in writing stating clearly
the reasons and basis therefor, upon forms adopted by the Fiscal Officer.
   (b)    In each case of a delinquent tax assessment, the Fiscal Officer shall
give to the assessee written notice thereof to be served by any reliable means
of delivery along with a copy of the delinquent tax assessment.
   (c)    Unless the assessee, within thirty days after service thereof, files
with the Fiscal officer a written petition appealing the delinquent tax
assessment addressed to the Executive and verified under oath by the assessee
or designee, and setting forth with particularity the items of assessment
objected to, together with the reasons for such objection, the assessment shall
become final and the amount shall be deemed a debt due and payable to the
County, whereupon the County shall file a civil action for judgment in the
amount of the assessment, including penalties added thereto under the

claimant currently exists, such refund, to the extent allowed, shall be applied
against such current liability. The Fiscal Officer shall certify the excess
amount of refund allowed or the full amount, as the case may be, and shall draw
funds in favor of the claimant. The Fiscal Officer shall pay such amount to the
credit of the appropriate County Fund.
   (d)    If the Fiscal Officer's decision on a claim for refund is to award
less than the full amount claimed, the decision shall be treated in the same
manner as an assessment under Section 
703.08 and the claimant and the County shall have all the rights, remedies and
duties as set forth in Section

this Section prominently appears as the first listed disclosure. Where a
supplier gives written estimates to consumers prior to the commencement of any
repair or service regardless of the anticipated cost of repairs or services,
the language in the form required by paragraph (a)(1) and the sign or form
required by (a)(2) of this Section may be modified to disclose that fact.

915.01 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines
concerning the protection of the public potable water supply from contamination
or pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water system. Further, provisions are made for the maintenance of a
continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and
effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's
potable water system.
   (b)   Policy. The Director of Sanitary Sewer Services shall be responsible
for the protection of the public potable water system from contamination due to
backflow of contaminants through the water service connection. If, in the
judgment of the Director, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary
at the water service connection to any consumer's premises for the safety of
the water system, the Director or his authorized representative shall give
notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention device at
each service connection to his premises. The consumer shall install such
approved device or devices at his own expense within thirty (30) calendar days
of written approval. Any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the
consumer to install such device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds
for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices
have been installed.

921.01 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines and standards
concerning the use of sanitary sewers in the Summit County Metropolitan Sewer
District to prevent the introduction of pollutants which may interfere with the
normal operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge, and to
prevent the introduction of pollutants which do not receive adequate treatment
in the sewage disposal system, and to improve the opportunity to recycle and
reclaim wastewater and sludge.
(Res. 92-824. Approved 12-29-92.)
921.02 PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   Where a public sewer is not available, the private sewer lateral shall be
connected to a private sewage disposal system complying with the provisions of
the Environmental Health Code of the Summit County General Health District or
any other applicable authority.
(Res. 92-824. Approved 12-29-92.)
921.03 SEWER CONNECTIONS.

925.01 PURPOSE.
   This Chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the Summit County
Metropolitan Sewer District and enables the County of Summit to comply with all
applicable federal and Ohio laws, including the Clean Water Act and the federal
general pretreatment regulations set forth in Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 403, as amended. The objectives of this Chapter are:
   (a)    To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
   (b)    To prevent the introduction of inadequately treated pollutants into
the POTW that will pass through the POTW into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
   (c)    To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and
sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;
   (d)    To promote the cost-effective beneficial use of POTW sludge; and
   (e)    To enable the County to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other federal or Ohio laws to which the POTW is subject.
      (Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.02 ADMINISTRATION.
   The Director shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this
Chapter, except as otherwise provided herein. Any powers granted to or duties
imposed upon the Director may be delegated by the Director to a duly authorized
County employee.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.03 LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.
   (a)    All dischargers shall comply with the most stringent of the following
limitations:
      (1)    National categorical pretreatment standards as promulgated by the
USEPA pursuant to the Act;
      (2)    State requirements and limitations on discharges to the sewage
disposal system;
      (3)    County supplemental limitations.
   (b)    When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual dischargers. The
Director shall follow conversion requirements established in 40 C.F.R. Section
403.6(C).
   (c)    When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial user may request that the County
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Director.
The County may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user
meets all the conditions set forth in subsections (c)(1)A. through (c)(2)D.
      (1)    To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         A.    Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         B.    Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         C.    Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-
term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the
long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         D.    Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         E.    Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)    An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         A.    Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         B.    Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         C.    Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20
percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (c)(l)C.
Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Director will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
          D.    Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (c)(l )A.
so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)    When developing equivalent mass limits, the Director:
         A.    Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average limit for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         B.    Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         C.    May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section
925.05 of this Chapter. The industrial user must also be in compliance with
Section
925.06 of this Chapter regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (d)   The Director may grant net/gross allowances to a discharger to adjust
for the presence of pollutants in the user's intake water. The user must
demonstrate that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable
categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated,
meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the user's water supply.
Credit allowance shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. The granting of the net/gross allowance shall be in
accordance with the procedures contained in 40 C.F.R. Section 403.15, as
amended.
   (e)    The County and any user may, by agreement, permit an industrial waste
of unusual strength or character to be admitted to the sewage disposal system,
either before or after pretreatment, provided there is no impairment of the
functioning of the sewage disposal system due to the admission of such wastes
and no extra costs are incurred by the County without recompense by the user. A
surcharge for extra strength wastewater or wastewater of unusual character
shall be determined as provided in Chapter
923 of Part Nine, Title Five of these Ordinances.
   (f)   As categorical pretreatment standards, the OEPA’s requirements or
limits on discharges to sewage disposal systems or the County supplemental
limitations are adopted or revised, such adopted or revised limitations shall
apply to all users.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.04 COUNTY SUPPLEMENTAL LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   The Director is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40
C.F.R. Section 403.5 (c).
   (b)   No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the sewerage
system pollutants at levels above the maximum background concentration, unless:
      (1)    The user is defined as a significant industrial user by the
Director; and
      (2)    The user is issued a wastewater discharge permit by the County
that allows the discharge of pollutants at limits specified in the permit.
   (c)   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater to the
sewerage system exceeding the pollutant concentration and/or mass loading
limits specified in the User's wastewater discharge permit issued by the
County.
   (d)   The Director shall develop, evaluate, and establish, as required,
allowable concentration limits, allowable pollutant mass loadings, allowable
industrial pollutant mass loadings and maximum background concentration limits
of pollutants for each wastewater treatment plant to which the County sewer
system discharges. The Director will provide the public with adequate notice of
changes in local industrial wastewater mass loadings and will provide responses
to interested parties before said changes take effect.
   (e)   Where, by agreement with other governmental units, the County conveys
wastewater for treatment at POTWs not owned and operated by the County, the
Director may use local supplemental limitations developed for the specific
wastewater treatment plant or limitations as stipulated in the appropriate
governmental agreement(s).
   (f)   The Director shall maintain a table of maximum background pollutant
concentrations and local industrial pollutant discharge limits for each
wastewater treatment plant and report his findings on supplemental limitations
at least annually to County Council. Local discharge limits shall be re-
evaluated by the Director when new or revised NPDES permit limits are issued by
the OEPA.
   (g)    The Director may establish best management practices through the
revision of this Chapter or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to
implement local limits and the requirements of Section
921.05 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.05 DILUTION.
   No user shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way for
the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with any wastewater discharge limit.
This requirement shall not prohibit the use of equalization tanks used to
regulate flows.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.06 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Users shall provide wastewater pretreatment as necessary to comply with this
Chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section
921.05 of this Chapter within the time limits specified by the USEPA, OEPA or
the Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Director for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director
before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the
County under the provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.07 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (a)    Whenever deemed necessary, the Director may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and
such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
   (b)    The Director may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (c)    Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, oil or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Director, shall comply
with Section
921.05 of this Chapter, and shall be so located to be easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and
repaired in accordance with Section
921.05 by the user at user's expense.
   (d)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable and/or toxic
substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible and/
or toxic gas detection meter.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.08 BYPASS.
   (a)    No user shall allow industrial wastewater to bypass pretreatment
facilities, and the County may take enforcement action against a discharger for
a bypass, unless:
      (1)    The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage as defined by 40 C.F.R. Section 403.17(2);
      (2)    There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; or
      (3)    The user submitted prior notice of the bypass per subsection
pursuant to subsection (b) and received approval from the Director.
   (b)    If a User knows in advance of the need to bypass, the user shall
notify the Director in writing at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to
the proposed bypass. The Director may approve, after considering its adverse
effects, a proposed bypass if the Director determines that the conditions of
subsection (a) have been met.
   (c)    A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) calendar days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report
on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four
(24) hours.
   (d)    A user may allow a bypass that does not violate any provision of its
permit if it is for maintenance essential to assure efficient operation of
pretreatment facilities. Such a bypass is not subject to the provisions of
subsections (b) and (c).
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.09 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   (a)    Each user, person or governmental entity, as required by the
Director, shall provide protection from the accidental discharge of prohibited
or regulated materials or substances. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
discharger's cost. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures
to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Director for review, and
shall be approved by the Director before construction or installation. Each
existing user shall complete its plan and submit same to the Director as
required by the Director. New SIUs that discharge to the sewerage system shall
not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
discharge protection procedures have been approved by the Director.
   (b)    The Director shall evaluate whether each user needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. The Director may require any user to develop. submit for approval,
and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to
control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Director may develop such a plan
for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)    Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)    Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)    Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of any
accidental or slug discharge; and
      (4)    Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
         (Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.10 HAULED WASTEWATER.
   (a)    The Director may require haulers of commercial or industrial
wastewater to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The Director may
require generators of hauled commercial or industrial wastewater to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits. The Director also may prohibit the
disposal of hauled commercial or industrial wastewater. The discharge of hauled
commercial or industrial wastewater is subject to all other requirements of
this Chapter.
   (b)    Commercial or industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at
locations designated by the Director. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the Director. The Director may collect samples of each hauled load
to ensure compliance with applicable Standards. The Director may require the
industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to
discharge.
   (c)    Commercial or industrial wastewater haulers must provide a waste
tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name
and address of the industrial wastewater hauler, permit number, truck
identification, names and addresses of wastewater sources and wastewater volume
and characteristics. The form shall identify the type of business or industry,
and any known or suspected waste constituents.
   (d)    The disposal of hauled residential septage or wastewater specified in
Section
921.05(c) of this Chapter into the County sewerage system is forbidden.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.11 INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT-- REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    No SIU shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first
obtaining an individual Wastewater Discharge Permit from the Director, except
that a SIU that has filed a timely application pursuant to Section
925.12 of this Chapter may continue to discharge for the time period specified
therein.
   (b)    The Director may require other Users to obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
   (c)    Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the
wastewater discharge permit holder to the sanctions set out in Sections
925.42 through
925.55 of this Chapter. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit
does not relieve a permit holder of its obligation to comply with all federal
and Ohio pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements
of federal, Ohio or County law.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.12 INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT-- EXISTING CONNECTIONS.
   Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who
was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this
section and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within
thirty (30) calendar days after said date, apply to the Director for an
individual wastewater discharge permit in accordance with Section
925.14 of this Chapter, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to
continue after thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of this section
except in accordance with an individual wastewater discharge permit issued by
the Director.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.13 INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT--NEW CONNECTIONS.
   Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who
proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such
permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application
for this individual wastewater discharge permit, in accordance with Section
925.14 of this Chapter, must be filed at least thirty (30) calendar days prior
to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)

925.24 BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS.
   (a)    Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date
of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on
a category determination under 40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is
later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the Director a report that
contains the information listed in paragraph (b), below. At least ninety (90)
days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that
become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the Director a report which
contains the information listed in paragraph (b), below. A New Source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical Standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
   (b)    Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
      (1)   All information required in Section
925.14 (a) (1) A., Section
925.14 (a) (2), Section

compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
         C.    Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula in
40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority;
         D.    Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
Sections
925.32 and
925.34 of this Chapter;
         E.    The Director may allow the submission of a baseline report which
utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
         F.    The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
      (3)    Compliance Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (4)    Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this Section must meet the requirements set out in Section
925.25 of this Chapter.
   (c)    Signature and Report Certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be certified in accordance with Section
925.37 of this Chapter and signed by an authorized representative.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.25 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE PROGRESS REPORTS.
   The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by
Section
925.24(b)(4) of this Chapter:
   (a)    The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
   (b)    No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
   (c)    The user shall submit a progress report to the Director no later than
fourteen (14) calendar days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
   (d)    In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Director.
      (Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.26 REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD DEADLINE.
    Within ninety (90) calendar days following the date for final compliance
with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new
source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the Director a report containing the information described in Section
925.14(a)(6) and (7) and 925.24(b)(3) of this Chapter. For Users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in Section
925.03 of this Chapter [Note: see, 40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(c)], this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long term production rate. For
all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure
of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during
the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Section
925.37 of this Chapter. All sampling will be done in conformance with Section
925.34 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.27 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (a)    Except as specified in Section
925.27(c) of this Chapter, all significant industrial users must, at a
frequency determined by the Director, submit no less than twice per year on
dates specified in the industrial user's industrial wastewater discharge
permit, reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the
Director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the user.
   (b)    The County may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the
following conditions:
      (1)    The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)    The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than 5 years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before
the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge
permit. (See, Section
925.14(c))
      (3)    In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)    The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with Section
925.15 (a) of this Chapter, and include the certification statement in Section
925.37  of this Chapter (See, 40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
      (5)    Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the USEPA approved method from 40 C.F.R.
Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in
the analysis.
      (6)    Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director must be
included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Director for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.
      (7)    Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
permit by the Director, the industrial user must certify on each report with
the statement in Section
925.38 of this Chapter that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
waste stream due to activities of the industrial user.
      (8)    In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of Section
925.28(a) of this Chapter, or other more frequent monitoring requirements
imposed by the Director, and notify the Director.
      (9)    This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (c)    The County may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports
[see
925.28(a) of this Chapter (40 C.F.R. Section 403.12(e)(1))] to a requirement to
report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in
the Pretreatment Standard or by OEPA, where the Industrial User's total
categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:
      (1)    0.01 percent of the design dry-weather hydraulic capacity of the
receiving wastewater treatment plant as measured by a continuous effluent flow
monitoring device, unless the Industrial User discharges in batches.
      (2)    0.01 percent of the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity
of the POTW;
      (3)    0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any
pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard for
which approved Local Limits were developed for the receiving wastewater
treatment plant in accordance with Section
925.04 of this chapter.
      (4)    Data tables containing specific values for Plants 25 and 36 are
provided in the Department's Enforcement Response Plan.
   Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the last
two (2) years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in Section
925.55 of this Chapter. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an
industrial user with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the Director, decreasing the
reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are
not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
    (d)    All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Section
925.37 of this Chapter.
   (e)    All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (f)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this Section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Director, using the procedures prescribed in
Section
925.34 of this Chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
   (g)    Users that send electronic documents to the County to satisfy the
requirements of this Section must e-mail these documents to the Industrial
Pretreatment Section at the Department of Sanitary Sewer Services in a Portable
Document File ("PDF") format. All compliance reports, including self-monitoring
reports, must conform fully to the reporting requirements specified in the
user's industrial wastewater discharge permit. Electronic documents must be
signed and certified in accordance with Section
925.37 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08; Ord. 2015-555. Adopted 12-14-15.)
925.28 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.

operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its
wastewater at least thirty (30) calendar days before the change.
   (a)    The Director may require the user to submit such information as may
be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission
of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section
925.14 of this Chapter.
   (b)    The Director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit
under Section
925.18 of this Chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
Section
925.19 of this Chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
      (Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.29 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (a)    In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and
notify the Director of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (b)    Within five (5) calendar days following such discharge, the user
shall, unless waived by the Director, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
Chapter.
   (c)    A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in paragraph (a) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (d)    SIUs are required to notify the Director immediately of any changes
at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.30 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to the Director as the Director may require.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.31 NOTICE OF VIOLATION: REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the Director within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation. Re-sampling by the industrial user is not required if
the County performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or
if the County performs sampling at the user’s facility between the time when
the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the County
receives the results of this sampling, or if the County performed the sampling
and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.32 WASTEWATER ANALYSIS.
   (a)    When requested by the Director, a user must submit information on the
nature and characteristics of its wastewater within ninety (90) calendar days
of the request. The Director is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose
and may periodically require users to update this information.
   (b)   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136,
as amended, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. The Director is authorized to require, at his or her
discretion, one or all of the approved techniques as set forth above. If Part
l36 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the OEPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any
other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the Director or other parties approved by OEPA.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08; Ord. 2012-261. Adopted 6-25-12.)
925.33 MONITORING.
   (a)    Each SIU or other discharger designated by the Director shall provide
and operate, at the user's expense, a monitoring facility to allow for the
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each commercial or industrial
wastewater discharge. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's
premises, except when otherwise approved by the Director. There shall be ample
room in or near each monitoring facility to allow sample collection and
preparation. The facility and equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. All monitoring
facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all
applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall
be completed within ninety (90) days of receipt of written notice from the
Director directing the user to construct the facilities unless otherwise
specified by the Director.
   (b)    All users, if directed by the Director, shall have an inspection and
sampling manhole with an opening of no less than twenty-four (24) inches in
diameter and an internal diameter of no less than forty- eight (48) inches that
contains flow measurement, recording and/or sampling equipment as may be
required by the County to ensure compliance with this Chapter. The structure
may be utilized by the user for the user's monitoring program if approved by
the Director. The user shall obtain all required permits prior to construction
of a monitoring facility.
   (c)    SIUs shall be responsible for the collection and testing of self
monitoring samples as specified in the user's permit. All tests shall be done
in accordance with approved laboratory standards. A copy of the results shall
be forwarded directly to the Industrial Pretreatment Section at the Department
of Sanitary Sewer Services. Samples shall be representative of the industrial
wastewater. Care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to ensure that
each sample is preserved in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Section l36.3(e).
   (d)    The frequency of monitoring by SIUs shall be as specified in the
applicable national categorical pretreatment standards or at intervals
determined by the Director. If pollutant concentration in the discharge varies
significantly, or if the likelihood of a pollutant slug is so great that a
“grab” sample of the wastewater is not representative of the wastewater, the
County may require the installation of flow-proportional or time-proportional
composite samplers.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08; Ord. 2015-555. Adopted 12-14-15.)
925.34 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (a)    Except as indicated in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section, the
user must collect wastewater samples using 24 hour flow proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the County, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate OEPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24 hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved OEPA methodologies may be authorized by the County,
as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous limits.
   (b)    Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (c)    For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day
compliance reports required in Sections
925.24 and
925.26 of this Chapter [40 C.F.R. Sections 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of
four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For
the reports required by paragraphs Section
925.27 of this Chapter [40 C.F.R. Sections 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to
assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.

(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.38 RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (a)    The Director or his designee shall have the right to enter the
premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this Chapter and any individual wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Director ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   (b)    Where a user has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Director shall be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   (c)    The Director shall have the right to set up on the user's property,
or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
and/or metering of the user's operations.
   (d)    The Director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
   (e)    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   (f)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the user's
premises (in excess of fifteen (15) minutes) shall be a violation of this
Section and subject the user to prescribed penalties.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.39 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   lf the Director has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this Chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the County designed to verify compliance with this Chapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, the Director may seek through the County Prosecutor
the issuance of a search warrant from the County of Summit Court of Common
Pleas.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.40 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits and
monitoring programs, and from the Director's inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Director, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable Ohio law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 C.F.R. Section 2.302
shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to
the public without restriction.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.41 ENFORCEMENT.
   The County shall develop a management system to provide consistent and fair
enforcement response to instances of noncompliance with Part Nine, Title Five
of these Ordinances. The Director shall develop the system and evaluate and
revise it as necessary. The system shall contain an enforcement response plan
consistent with this Chapter, that details procedures and time frames to be
followed by the Department. The County Executive shall provide an annual
enforcement response report to County Council.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.42 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of Chapters
921,
923,
925 or
927 of Part Nine, Title Five of these Ordinances, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Director may serve upon that User a written notice of
violation. Any charges, administrative fines or fees shall be levied by the
Director for the violation shall also be included in the notice. Within thirty
(30) calendar days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Director. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice. Thereafter,
the parties shall meet, if required, to establish a plan for correction in the
form of an order or compliance schedule. This shall be termed a first level
enforcement action. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the
Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.43 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Director may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections
925.45 and
925.46 of this Chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.44 DIRECTOR'S AND SHOW CAUSE HEARINGS.
   (a)   If a user does not correct a violation in a timely manner after a
first level enforcement action, the Director may order the user to pay an
administrative fine and appear at a Director's hearing.
   (b)   Whenever the County finds that any user has engaged in conduct which
justifies revocation of a wastewater discharge permit pursuant to this Chapter,
the Director shall serve or cause to be served upon such user a written notice
either personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
stating the nature of the alleged violation and the amount of the
administrative fines, charges and fees. Within thirty (30) days of the date of
receipt of notice, the user shall respond personally or in writing, advising
the County of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter the
parties shall meet in a Director's hearing to ascertain the veracity of the
allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory
correction of the violation in the form of a consent order. Failure to comply
with a consent order is a violation of Section
925.43 and warrants escalation to a show cause hearing. Actions taken from this
section shall be termed a second level enforcement action.
   (c)    The Director may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Director and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user and required
by Section
925.15(a). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
   (d)   The Director of Sanitary Sewer Services or the Director's
representative shall conduct the hearing and shall determine the order in which
the hearing shall proceed.
   (e)   At the hearing, the user or the Authorized Representative of the user
or the user's attorney or technical consultant shall be permitted to present
the user's position, arguments and contentions. Evidence may be admitted and
witnesses may be examined and cross-examined to either support the user's
position or to refute evidence and testimony offered by the County. Further,
the right to proffer evidence into the record shall be recognized. All
witnesses shall be placed under oath and the Director shall permit subpoenas to
be issued upon written request. If neither the user nor the authorized
representative of the user appear at the hearing, the Director shall proceed
with the hearing. A written record of the hearing proceedings shall be kept and
copies supplied to all parties involved.
   (f)   Within thirty (30) days from the date of the hearing, the Director
shall render a decision in writing, supported by conclusions of fact supporting
his decision, to all parties. The Director may order any appropriate relief
including dismissal of the citation compliance schedule or termination of
wastewater treatment services and the wastewater discharge permit of the user.
The decision of the Director shall be a final administrative order and any user
adversely affected by such decision may appeal to the County of Summit Court of
Common Pleas according to law.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08; Ord. 2015-555. Adopted 12-14-15.)
925.45 COMPLIANCE ORDER.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.46 CEASE AND DESIST ORDER.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, order
issued pursuant to this Chapter, any other pretreatment standard or requirement
or finds that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
   (a)    Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (b)    Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.47 ADM1NISTRATIVE FINES.
   (a)    When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, order issued pursuant to this Chapter, or any pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000) per day, as required under Ohio Administrative Code
Section 3745-3-03. Such fines shall be assessed on a per- violation, per-day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   (b)    Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30)
calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of two percent
(2%) per month. A lien against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
   (c)    Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within fourteen (l4) calendar days of being notified of the fine. Where a
request has merit, the Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the
event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User. The Director may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
   (d)    Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.48 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE.
   (a)    The Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present, or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to life, human health
or the environment.
   (b)    Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in Section
925.49 of this Chapter are initiated against the User.
   (c)    A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under Sections
925.44 or
925.49 of this Chapter.
   (d)    Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this Section.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.49 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (a)    In addition to the provisions in Section
925.22 of this Chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)    Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)    Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)    Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)    Violation of the pretreatment standards in this Chapter.
   (b)    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
925.44 of this Chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.50 INTERPRETATION OF REGULATIONS.
   Any user or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing
an interpretation or ruling by the Director on any matter covered by this
chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such
inquiry is by a user and deals with matters of performance or compliance with
this chapter for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is
the subject, receipt of a discharger's request, may at the Director's
discretion stay all proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.51 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an
order issued pursuant to this Chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Director may petition the County of Summit Court of Common
Pleas through the County Prosecutor for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this Chapter on the activities of the user. The Director
may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.52 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)    A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued
pursuant to this Chapter, or any pretreatment standard or requirement shall be
liable to the County for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term
average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period
of the violation.
   (b)    The Director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the County.
   (c)    In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court may take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by
the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
   (d)    Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.54 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this Chapter are not exclusive. The Director
may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the County's enforcement response plan. However, the Director may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.
(Ord. 2008-375. Adopted 9-29-08.)
925.55 ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   The Director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation
that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the
POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12)
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be
applicable to all SIUs (or any other industrial user that violates paragraphs
(c), (d) or (h) of this Section) and shall mean:
   (a)    Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits;
   (b)    Technical Review Criteria ("TRC") violations, which are defined as
those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements
taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or
exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement
including Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Section
920.02(a)(71) multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats,
oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (c)    Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement defined
by Chapter
925 that the Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public;
   (d)    Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Director's exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (e)    Failure to meet, within ninety (90) calendar days of the scheduled
date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;

926.01 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (a)    This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for tributary community
discharge into the County's wastewater collection and treatment systems, and
enables the County to protect public health in conformity with all applicable
local, state and federal laws related thereto. The
objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)    Satisfy the State and Federal requirements that the County
develops and implements a Storm Water Quality Management Program in accordance
with the Water Quality Act of 1987, 40 CFR Part 402(P).
       (2)    Provide a procedure by which the County can enforce the
elimination of separate sanitary sewer overflows up to the specified design
storm event, ban combined sewer systems in areas served by County sewers, and
control peak flows from community sewer systems at the point of connection into
sewers owned by the County or sewers owned by another community providing
wastewater services to the County.
   (b)    This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the
County's wastewater system through the issuance of permits and the enforcement
of administrative regulations. This chapter does not provide for the recovery
of operations, maintenance, or replacement costs of the County's wastewater
treatment or transportation systems or other costs associated with the
construction of collection and treatment systems, which are the subject of
separate sewer use agreements.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)
926.02 TRIBUTARY COMMUNITY DISCHARGE PROGRAM.
   (a)    A tributary community discharge program shall be implemented through
the issuance of community discharge permits. The permits shall delineate, among
other things, the annual average flow rates and peak design flow rates which
can be discharged to a given point of discharge or meter station, the
elimination of separate sanitary sewer overflows up to the specified design
storm event, the ban of combined storm sewers, and best management practices
for operation and maintenance of sanitary collection systems.
   (b)    Each community shall, as a condition of its permit, be required to
initiate and continue best management practices identified in its permit.
   (c)    Each community shall operate its sanitary collection systems under
the supervision of a State Certified Operator's License. If the community does
not have the appropriate certification, the County will require compliance
within eighteen (18) months of the date of permit issuance.
   (d)    Each community shall identify and disclose to the County, as soon as
they become known, all separate sanitary sewer overflow points/facilities and
all combined sewer overflow points/facilities known or which become known to
the community that are not included on the County's inventory.
   (e)    Each community is to evaluate and select the means by which the
performance objectives identified in a given community discharge permit can be
achieved, and to design, construct, finance and maintain the necessary
improvements. The community shall also initiate and continue best management
practices identified in its permit. The implementing community shall be solely
responsible for projects set forth in its community compliance plan and for
compliance with the performance objective(s) identified in its community
discharge permit.
   (f)    No New Sanitary Overflows. No sanitary overflows shall exist except
for those that are controlled in accordance with the community discharge
permit. Construction of new sanitary sewer overflows is prohibited. All
identified or newly identified sanitary sewer overflows not controlled in
accordance with the community discharge permit shall be eliminated. The
elimination shall be spelled out in the community compliance plan.
   (g)    No Combined Sewers. Construction of new combined sewers is
prohibited. All identified or newly identified combined sewers shall be
eliminated. The elimination shall be spelled out in the community compliance
plan.
   (h)    Performance objectives shall be achieved as soon as practicable. As
soon as practicable shall be determined on a case by case basis considering all
relevant factors. These factors shall primarily include, but are not limited
to, the following:
      (1)    The date on which the County sewer, if any, to which a peak flow
reduction performance objective is related or for which an overflow control
performance objective is dependent, is available to receive flow or required to
realize a peak flow reduction.
       (2)    The reasonable time necessary to plan, design and construct the
required facilities, including rehabilitation.
       (3)    Financial considerations.
      (4)    Impact of any delay upon receiving streams and facilities to which
the flow is tributary.
       (5)    Externally imposed schedule requirements.
   (i)    Each community shall maintain a current map of all sanitary sewers
tributary to the County. A copy is to be supplied to the County on an annual
basis or as requested by the County.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)
926.03 COMMUNITY DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   (a)    The County shall issue permits to communities with requirements,
conditions, and performance objectives as necessary to achieve the purpose of
this chapter.
   (b) The County shall notify a community by certified mail of actions the
community shall be required to undertake under the authority of this chapter
and applicable sewer use agreements. The permit shall contain or require the
following information at a minimum:
(1)    General conditions.
(2)    Performance objective, including peak flow limitations.
(3)    Community Compliance Plan, including general conditions, compliance
schedule as required, and special conditions of approval.

schedule for preparation and submittal of the fact sheet and community
compliance plan identifying the means by which the community intends to achieve
its performance objectives.
   (d)    Upon approval by the County of a community compliance plan, such
plan, including a schedule of compliance, shall be deemed incorporated into the
respective community discharge permit for all purposes of this Code. The
failure of a community to submit or obtain County approval of a plan within
ninety (90) days of the required submittal date shall be deemed a circumstance
for initiation of enforcement action pursuant to Sections
926.09 through
926.99.
   (e)    Permit Modifications, Suspension or Revocation. After notice and
opportunity for a hearing, the community discharge permit may be modified,
suspended or revoked by the Director in whole or in part during its effective
term. The County shall retain the right of revision to amend the Code or the
granted permit. In the event of said modification or amendment, the County
shall notify the permitee not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective
date of such modification or amendment to its community discharge permit.
   The community may, at any time, apply for modification of any part of its
community discharge permit. The application should be submitted to the County
at least ninety (90) days before the date on which it is desired that the
modification become effective.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)

926.05 PROGRAM MONITORING.
   (a)    The community shall implement a monitoring program upon County
issuance of the community discharge permit. The monitoring program shall be
designed to determine compliance with specific performance objective(s). The
program shall be submitted to the County for approval and the County reserves
the right to modify or amend the permit's program monitoring requirements.
   (b)    The County shall have the authority to conduct monitoring for
verification and other purposes within the community sewer system.
   (c)    The community shall provide an annual report on its performance
objectives and community compliance plan in a format provided by the County.
More frequent (monthly, quarterly, or biannual) monitoring and reporting may be
required by the County.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)
926.06 RECORDS RETENTION.
   Communities subject to this Code shall retain and preserve all records,
books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries
thereof relating to planning, design, maintenance, monitoring, sampling,
financing and legislative action on the part of a community in connection with
its compliance or noncompliance with its permit and related compliance plans in
accordance with all local, state and federal law and regulations.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)

(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00; Ord. 2015-555. Adopted 12-14-15.)
926.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    The County may initiate enforcement action against a community for
violation of any provision of this chapter including, but not limited to, the
community’s failure to:
(1)    Implement projects on a permit-required schedule.
(2)    Follow best management practices specified in their permit.
(3)    Properly respond to a request for evidence of progress or explanation
for delay.
(4)    Meet a specified performance objective.
(5)    Produce a sewer map as required by the County.
(6)    Submit an approvable community compliance plan or fact sheet in a timely
manner.
(7)    Conduct and submit discharge program monitoring.
(8)    Prevent the creation of a new sanitary overflow.
(9)    Report known sanitary overflow locations or events to the County.
(10)   Eliminate or prevent construction of combined sanitary sewers.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)
   (b)    The County may take an enforcement action available in this chapter,
including but not limited to, charges and fees (
926.09(e)), notice of violation (
926.09(c) and
926.09(e)), Director’s hearing (
926.10), show cause hearing (
926.10), judicial proceedings (
926.11), recovery of costs incurred by the County, and fees (
926.09(e)). By definition and for use with these enforcement sections, a
“discharger” is defined as a person or governmental entity as defined in this
chapter, including a “community.” The enforcement action may be taken alone or
in combination as necessary to effectuate the achievement of specified
performance objectives.
(Ord. 2000-812. Adopted 12-18-00.)
   (c)    Whenever the Director finds that any discharger has violated its
community discharge permit or this chapter, the Director shall serve verbal or
written notice upon the violator stating a brief and concise description of the
alleged violation and directing compliance within thirty (30) days or other
reasonable period as provided by the Director. Any charges within forty-five
(45) days of issuance of the NOV, the discharger shall respond personally or in
writing advising the County of its position. Thereafter, the parties shall
meet, if required, to establish a plan for correction in the form of an order
or compliance schedule. This shall be termed a first level enforcement action.
   (d)    If a discharger does not correct a violation in a timely manner after
a first level enforcement action, the Director may order the discharger to
appear at a Director's hearing.
   (e)    Whenever the County finds that any discharger has failed to correct
or willfully ignores violations of a community discharge permit, pursuant to
ordinance, the Director shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger
a written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation and the amount
of charges and fees. Within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of notice,
the discharger shall respond personally or in writing, advising the County of
its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter the parties shall meet
in a Director's hearing to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where
necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction of the violation in
the form of a consent order. Failure to comply with a consent order is a
violation of this section and warrants escalation to a show cause hearing.
Actions taken from this section shall be termed a second level enforcement
action.
   (f)    Where the violation of ordinance has not been corrected by the
discharger in a timely manner after a Director's hearing, the Director may
order the discharger to show cause before him or his duly authorized
representative, why enforcement action should not be taken. A written notice
shall be served on the discharger either personally or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and the place of
the hearing, the reason for why the enforcement action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action, and directing the discharger to show cause before
the Director or his designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten (10) days
before the hearing. Thereafter, the Director shall enter appropriate orders
with respect to the alleged violation. The orders may be in the form of a
compliance order or a cease and desist order.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)
926.10 HEARING; DIRECTOR'S AND SHOW CAUSE.
   (a)    The Director of Sanitary Sewer Services or the Director's
representative shall conduct the hearing and shall determine the order in which
the hearing shall proceed.
   (b)    At the hearing, both the discharger or its representative or attorney
or technical consultant shall be permitted to present its position, arguments
and contentions. Evidence may be admitted and witnesses may be examined and
cross-examined to either support the discharger's position or to refute
evidence and testimony offered by the County. Further, the right to proffer
evidence into the record shall be recognized. All witnesses shall be placed
under oath and the Director shall permit subpoenas to be issued upon written
request. If neither the discharger nor its authorized representative appears at
the hearing, the Director shall proceed with the hearing. A written record of
the hearing proceedings shall be kept and copies supplied to all parties
involved.
   (c)    Within thirty (30) days from the date of the hearing, the Director
shall render a decision in writing, supported by conclusions of fact supporting
his decision, to all parties. The Director may order any appropriate relief
including dismissal of the citation compliance schedule or termination of
wastewater treatment services and the wastewater discharge permit of the
discharger. The decision of the Director shall be a final administrative order
and any discharger adversely affected by such decision may appeal to the common
pleas court according to law.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00; Ord. 2015-555. Adopted 12-14-15.)
926.11 JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.
   In the event of failure of the discharger to comply with a compliance order
or cease and desist order within the specified time, the Director may commence
judicial proceedings or take other action as deemed appropriate. The Director
may terminate judicial proceedings upon proof by the discharger of the
elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00.)
926.12 INTERPRETATION OF REGULATIONS.
   Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in
writing an interpretation or ruling by the Director of Sanitary Sewer Services
on any matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written
reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters
of performance or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement activity
relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's
request may at the Director's discretion stay all proceedings pending receipt
of the aforesaid written reply.
(Ord. 2000-563. Adopted 11-13-00; Ord. 2015-555. Adopted 12-14-15.)
926.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    Injunctive Relief. Whenever a community has violated or continues to
violate this chapter, its community discharge permit, or any administrative
order of the County or court of competent jurisdiction, the County may petition
the Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as
may be appropriate) to restrain or compel activities on the part of the
community.
   (b)    Civil penalties. Any person, or persons who intentionally or
willfully violate any provision of this chapter, their community discharge
permit, or any administrative order of the County or court of competent
jurisdiction or any person or persons that allow a violation to continue after
becoming aware of said violation shall be punishable, upon conviction, by a
criminal penalty of up to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) per day per
violation and not more than six (6) months in jail. Second offenders may be
fined up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per day and imprisonment for no
more than two (2) years.
   (c)    Falsifying Information. Any person or persons who knowingly make any
false statement, representation or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
chapter, any community discharge permit, or any administrative order of the
County or court of competent jurisdiction, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method, shall be
punishable, upon conviction, by a criminal penalty of up to eighteen thousand
dollars ($18,000) per day per violation and not more than six (6) months in
jail. The maximum penalties for second violations are twice those for first
violators.

927.01 AUTHORITY OVER PRIVATE SEWER LATERALS.
   (a)   The County shall have the authority to establish and enforce
regulations concerning the construction, installation and use of private sewer
laterals. The basis of the authority is the home rule police power derived from
the County Charter which permits regulation in areas concerning the health,
safety and welfare of the public.
      (1)   All sanitary sewers and appurtenances, of every kind and nature
within the territory of the Summit County Metropolitan Sewer District shall be
under the care and control of the Director of Sanitary Sewer Services.
      (2)   Subject to other provisions of this chapter, property owners are
responsible for the installation, maintenance, destruction, operation, or
upkeep of private sewer laterals.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this
section, upon discovery, if a sanitary sewer lateral serving a residential
property ("Private Sewer Lateral" as defined below) breaks within the County's
portion of the sanitary sewer ("Public Sewer Lateral" as defined below), and
the break was not caused by any fault on the part of the property owner or
occupant, the County will repair or replace that sanitary sewer. By assuming
responsibility for such repairs, the County does not forfeit any defenses,
claims, rights, or causes of action it may have against any third party other
than the property owner.
         (i)   The Public Sewer Lateral serving a residential property extends
from the public sewer to the property owner's property line.
         (ii)   The Private Sewer Lateral serving a residential property
includes any portion of the sanitary sewer on the property owner's property.
         (iii)   If the property owner's property line is within or abuts a
County owned easement or right-of-way, the dividing point between the Public
Sewer Lateral and the Private Sewer Lateral is at the easement or right-of-way
line.
      (4)   Where it has been determined by the Director of Sanitary Sewer
Services that a break exists in any sanitary sewer lateral, and that the County
is not responsible for repair or replacement of the sanitary sewer lateral
under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Director shall give notice by
regular mail to the property owner to repair or replace the sanitary sewer
lateral. If the property owner fails to make the needed corrections to the
sanitary sewer lateral within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the
Director may perform the work necessary to repair or replace the sanitary sewer
lateral. The cost of such work shall be charged to the property owner and shall
become immediately payable to the Department of Sanitary Sewer Services upon
written notice of the amount to the property owner. If the property owner does
not make full payment, then any delinquent fees associated with the repair(s)
or replacement(s) shall be certified to the Fiscal Officer of the County of
Summit, to be placed on the property owner's tax list and duplicate and
collected as other taxes are collected.
      (5)   Nothing herein shall be construed to be a waiver of any defenses
and immunities available at law to the County.
   (b)   Additional authority for such regulations is found in the December 17,
1974 agreement between the County and the Board of Health of the Summit County
General Health District which authorizes the County to perform the following
services previously performed by the Board of Health:
      (1)   Issue permits and inspect the construction of all private sewer
laterals in the County's sewer district.
      (2)   Enforce private sewer lateral standards established by the Board of
Health.
      (3)   Collect fees for the cost of issuing permits and inspecting private
sewer laterals.
      (4)   Register private sewer lateral installers (pursuant to the February
24, 1975 letter of clarification from the Health Commissioner).
   (c)   The provisions of the Environmental Health Code of the Summit County
General Health District pertaining to private sewer laterals and private sewer
lateral installers, as they may be amended from time to time, are incorporated
herein as if fully rewritten hereof. The County shall enforce the applicable
provisions of the Environmental Health Code except in the event of a conflict
with the provisions of this Title Five - Sewers and Wastewater in which case
the provisions of this Title shall control.
(Res. 92-824. Approved 12-29-92; Ord. 2019-244. Adopted 6-24-19.)
927.02 SEWER PERMITS.
   (a)   No unauthorized person shall uncover, open, use, alter, disturb or
connect with any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a
sewer permit from the Director of Sanitary Sewer Services. No person shall make
any modifications to an existing structure connected to a public sewer which
results in a change from one user classification to another without first
obtaining a sewer permit from the Director.
   (b)   To obtain a sewer permit, the owner of the property to be connected or
an agent shall complete and file with the County a prescribed permit
application. The application shall be accompanied by any plans, specifications
or other information required by the Director.
   (c)   The sewer permit shall be issued to an applicant upon approval of the
application and other submittals. A permit and inspection fee shall be paid to
the County at the time the permit is issued.
   (d)   In no case shall work be commenced and prosecuted unless the sewer
permit is issued and in the possession of the person doing the work authorized
by the permit. Each permit shall state the correct name and number of the
house, building or establishment, and the lot or sublot for which the
connection is being made.

   (g)   The Director shall assign an inspector to the work as soon as is
practicable, to assure quality, workmanship, and conformance with the current
standards and specifications. Work shall not commence until the inspector is
present or has authorized construction before the arrival of the inspector. The
inspector shall approve or disapprove the installation of the private sewer
lateral and the connection to the public sewer lateral. In the event the work
is disapproved, the owner shall not discharge flows to the sanitary sewer until
such time as all problems have been resolved and the work has been approved by
the inspector.
   (h)   All excavations for private sewer laterals shall be adequately guarded
with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the
work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the County.

937.01 PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of streams within the County
of Summit contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the County of Summit. The purpose of this Riparian Setback chapter
is to protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the County of
Summit and to protect residents of the County of Summit from property loss and
damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream. The method of
implementing this chapter is by controlling uses and developments within a
Riparian Setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter
streams.
      (5)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream
channels.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (7)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide
array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the County of Summit economically by minimizing
encroachment on stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering
solutions such as dams and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and to the environment of the County of Summit, the quality
of life of the residents of the County of Summit and corresponding property
values.
      (9)   Protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
County of Summit.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect these services of
riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses
in riparian setbacks.
(Ord. 2002-154. Adopted 4-29-02.)

to restore the Riparian Setback through a plan approved by Summit SWCD.
   (d)   The provisions of this Title Seven may be enforced through civil or
criminal proceedings brought by the County of Summit Prosecutor on behalf of
the County of Summit.
(Ord. 2002-154. Adopted 4-29-02.)
937.03 CONFLICTS WITH OTHER REGULATIONS AND SEVERABILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by any other provision of law, regulation, contract or
deed, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
   (b)   These regulations shall not limit or restrict the application of other
provisions of law, regulation, contract, or deed, or the legal remedies
available thereunder, except as provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   If any clause, section, or provision of these regulations is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected thereby.

cover is destroyed and which may result in, or contribute to, erosion and
sediment pollution.
   (s)   STREAM: A surface watercourse with a well-defined bed and bank, either
natural or artificial, which confines and conducts continuous or periodical
flowing water (ORC 6105.01) in such a way that terrestrial vegetation cannot
establish roots within the channel.
   (t)    STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP): The plan which
describes all the elements of the stormwater strategy implemented during and
after construction. The plan addresses erosion control and stormwater quality.

(Ord. 2004-133. Adopted 3-15-04.)
937.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF A RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)    Riparian Setbacks are established as provided in this Title Seven.
   (b)    Streams addressed by this chapter are those which meet the definition
of “stream” in Section
937.04 of these regulations and are indicated on at least one of the following
maps:
      (1)   USGS topographical map.
      (2)   Summit County Riparian Setback map.
      (3)    Soils maps located in the Soil Survey for Summit County, Ohio,
USDA, NRCS.
   (c)   Widths of setbacks are measured as horizontal map distance outward
from the ordinary high water mark on each side of a stream, and are established
as follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 300 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 20 square miles and up to 300 square miles.
      (3)   A minimum of 75 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.5 square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles.
      (4)   A minimum of 50 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.05 square mile (32 acres) and up to 0.5 square mile (320 acres).
      (5)   A minimum of 30 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
less than 0.05 square mile (32 acres).
   (d)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
chapter: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey stormwater to another system, tile drainage systems,
and stream culverts.
   (e)    The following shall apply to the Riparian Setback:
      (1)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than the Riparian Setback on
either or both sides of the stream, the Riparian Setback shall be extended to
the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA and approved by the County of Summit Department of Building
Standards.
      (2)   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the Riparian Setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope        Width of Setback
15% through 20%              Add 25 feet
Greater than 20% through 25% Add 50 feet
Greater than 25%             Add 100 feet
   
Average percent slope of the streambank is to be calculated for the area within
the Riparian Setback and is to be measured as a line perpendicular to the
stream channel at the location where structures or uses are proposed in the
plan. All of the following measurements aare to be performed using County of
Summit Geographical Information system data (1994, 2000). Calculate slope as
follows:
Change in elevation from the edge of stream channel to edge of Riparian Setback
divided by Horizontal map distance from the edge of stream channel to the edge
of the Riparian Setback.
      (3)   Where wetlands protected under federal or state law are identified
within the Riparian Setback, the Riparian Setback shall consist of the full
extent of the wetlands plus the following additional setback widths:
         A.   A 50-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of Category
3 wetlands.
         B.    A 30-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 2 wetlands.
         C.    No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands.
      (4)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate
agencies. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the
Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of
application of the regulations.
      (5)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the Riparian
Setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by subsections
(b) through (d) hereof, and identifying this setback on all subdivisions, land
development plans, and/or building permit applications. This delineation shall
be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans, or all plans that
are required, or at the time of submission of any permit applications. This
delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the Summit SWCD. As the
result of this review, the Summit SWCD may require further studies from the
applicant.
      (6)   Prior to any soil disturbing activity, the Riparian Setback shall
be clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by
the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout
soil- disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained in an
undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these regulations. All fencing
shall be removed when a development project is completed.
      (7)    No approvals or permits shall be issued by the County of Summit or
Township prior to delineation of the Riparian Setback in conformance with these
regulations.
      (8)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the Riparian Setback
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the County of Summit.
         (Ord. 2004-133. Adopted 3-15-04.)
937.06 USES PERMITTED IN THE RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)   The following uses are permitted by right within the Riparian Setbacks
without prior approval. Open space uses that are passive in character shall be
permitted in the Riparian Setback including, but not limited to, those listed
in subsections (a)(1) through (4) hereof. No use permitted under these
regulations shall be construed as allowing trespass on privately held lands.
   Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited. Except as otherwise
provided in these regulations, the Riparian Setback shall be preserved in its
natural state.
      (1)   Recreational activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by

fishing, hunting, picnicking and similar uses and associated structures
including boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables,
and wildlife viewing areas.
      (2)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than 6 inches in diameter, shall be anchored to the shore or
removed from the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or reforestation. The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the Riparian Setback shall be allowed without approval of the
Summit SWCD. Species of shrubs and vines recommended for stabilizing floodprone
areas along streams within the County of Summit are listed in the Appendix.
      (4)   The County of Summit Engineer maintains the right of access to all
streams within the County of Summit for the purposes outlined in the Ohio
Revised Code, Sections 6131.01 to 6131.64, 6133.01 to 6133.15, 6135.01 to
6135.27, and 6137.05.1.
   (b)   The following uses are permitted by right within the Riparian Setbacks
with prior approval of the design.
      (1)   Stream bank stabilization/erosion control measures. Best Management
Practices (BMP’s) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control may be
allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, state, and
federal government regulations and are ecologically compatible and emphasize
the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical and
available. Such stream bank stabilization/ erosion control practices shall only
be undertaken upon approval of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP or
SW3P) by the Summit SWCD.
      (2)   Crossings. In reviewing plans for stream crossings, the Township
may confer with the Summit SWCD, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Natural Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division
of Surface Water; the County of Summit Engineer; the Department of Sanitary
Sewer Services of Summit County; the Summit County Health Department; or other
technical experts as necessary.
         A.   Limited crossings of designated streams through the Riparian
Setback by vehicles, storm sewers, sewer and / or water lines, and public
utility lines will be per the approval of local, county, and state governing
agencies and as a part of the regular subdivision review process.
         B.   One driveway crossing per stream per tax parcel will be allowed
for individual landowners.
         C.   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be designed
and constructed per the County of Summit Engineer’s design standards and as
approved by the Summit County Planning Commission and approving township. If
more than two crossings per 1,000 linear feet of stream center is required for
these areas, the applicant must apply for a variance.
         D.   All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the Riparian Setback and shall mitigate any
necessary disturbances.
      (3)   Placement of stormwater retention or detention facilities may be
considered within the Riparian Setback if:
         A.   Stormwater quality treatment that is consistent with current
state standards is incorporated into the basin.
         B.   The stormwater quality treatment basin is located at least 50
feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.

*High Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet species surviving when flooded or
exposed to high water table more than 40% of the growing season.
*Moderate Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet species surviving when flooded
or exposed to high water table more than 30% of the growing season but less
than 40%.
*Intermediate Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet-mesic species surviving
occasional inundation or elevated water table between 20% and 30% of the
growing season.
*Low Flood Tolerance: Generally upland mesic and mesic-dry species rarely
inundated or exposed to an elevated water table for periods of short duration,
between 5% and 20% of the growing season.
*No Flood Tolerance: Generally upland dry species exhibiting immediate and
rapid decline frequently culminating in death if inundated or exposed to
elevated water table for more than 5% of the growing season.
**Shade Tolerance: Shade tolerance means able to grow in a state of health and
vigor beneath dense shade. In this ranking, shrubs and vines are ranked on a
scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very shade tolerant, and 5 being very shade
intolerant.

941.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   The SWP3 must contain a description and location of all appropriate
BMPs for each construction operation. Prior to the start of grading and within
seven days from the start of grubbing the applicant must implement such
controls. The SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity
the appropriate control measures; the general sequence during the construction
process under which the measures will be implemented; and the person(s)
responsible for implementation. The time frame for SWP3 implementation shall be
consistent with the current Ohio EPA NPDES Construction permit. No project
subject to this Chapter shall commence without a SWP3 or approved by the Summit
SWCD. No project subject to this Chapter shall commence without a pre-
construction meeting being held with the Summit SWCD. It will be the
applicant’s responsibility to contact the SWCD.
   (b)   The applicant shall inform all contractors and subcontractors not
otherwise defined as “operators” as defined in the Ohio EPA’s NPDES Permit, who
will be involved in the implementation of the SWP3 of the terms and conditions
of the SWP3. The applicant shall maintain a written document containing the
signatures of all contractors and subcontractors involved in the implementation
of the SWP3 as proof acknowledging that they have reviewed and understand the
conditions and responsibilities of the SWP3. The written document shall be
created and signatures shall be obtained prior to commencement of work on the
construction site. A copy shall be provided to the Summit SWCD prior to
commencing with the project.
   (c)   All projects regardless of the area of disturbance must utilize BMP’s
to minimize erosion and off site sedimentation. The controls shall include the
following minimum components:
      (1)   DURING ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION
         A.   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The applicant must make use
of practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
            1.   Stream protection. The requirements of Chapter
937 Riparian Setbacks of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit shall
be followed.
            2.   Wetland Protection.  The setback requirements of the Summit
County Subdivision Regulations shall be followed in addition to state and
federal regulations.
         B.   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The applicant must make use of erosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over 70% of disturbed soils. A
description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after
grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
         C.   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES. The applicant must make use of measures
that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.
Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to
direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
         D.   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES. The applicant must install structural
practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert
flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas.
Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment from a
site remaining disturbed for more than 7 days. Such practices may include,
among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding or filtering runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth
diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control
practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
         E.   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials and concrete wash out water shall be discharged in
storm water runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices
to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering
water resources or wetlands.
         F.   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
         G.   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
         H.   APPLICANT INSPECTIONS. An initial inspection of all erosion and
sediment control practices shall be conducted by a qualified individual to
certify that the installations comply with the approved SWP3. All controls on
the site shall be inspected by the applicant’s agent at least once every seven
calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half
inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall assign a qualified
individual to conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices
are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether
additional control measures are required. Internal inspections and
documentation of corrective actions taken must be made available upon request.
         I.   MAINTENANCE. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Summit SWCD.
            1.   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
               i.   When practices require repair or maintenance.  If an
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
               ii.   When practices fail to provide their intended function.
If an inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
               iii.   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If
an inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
         J.   FINAL STABLIZATION. All soil disturbing activities are complete
and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent coverage
for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by
permanent structures. In addition, all temporary erosion and sediment control
practices have been removed and disposed of in an acceptable manner.
      (2)   POST CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY PRACTICES
         A.   NON-STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Non- structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
            1.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
            2.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
in perpetuity in accordance with Chapter
943 of these Ordinances. All easement or conservation areas must appear on the
final plat and be disclosed to potential buyers.
         B.   STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Structural post construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration.
            1.   All structural water quality practices must be established
prior to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices
should be made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If
detention/retention facilities were used for sediment control during
development sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post
construction storm water quality.
            2.   Maintenance. The post construction water quality practice must
be maintained in perpetuity in accordance with Chapter 943 of these Ordinances.

Engineer recalculate the number of ERUs to be charged. The County Engineer
shall notify the owner, in writing, of any change to the calculation of ERU s.
Any owner that receives a notice of the calculation of ERUs by the County
Engineer under this paragraph may appeal the calculation in the manner and
method set forth in Section
942.09 of these Codified Ordinances.
   (g)    Notwithstanding Section
942.09(e), with respect to Conventionally Developed Residential Property, if,
due to demolition, destruction, or some other cause, the Dwelling Units and
appurtenant structures are removed such that the Zoned Lot or Tract no longer
qualifies as Conventionally Developed Residential Property and instead
qualifies as Undeveloped Land, an owner may notify the County Engineer of such
change and request that the County Engineer recalculate the number of ERUs to
be charged. The County Engineer shall notify the owner, in writing of any
change to the calculation of ERUs. Any owner that receives a notice of the
calculation of ERUs by the County Engineer under this paragraph may appeal the
calculation in the manner and method set forth in Section
942.09 of these Codified Ordinances.

      (b)   The County Engineer may impose such reasonable conditions or
requirements upon the issuance of a permit as the Engineer deems necessary or
proper to assure faithful compliance with this Chapter. The County Engineer
shall take into consideration the public health, safety, general welfare, and
particular consideration shall be given as to whether the plan shall cause
negative impacts or create any of the following conditions:
         (1)    Interference with surface water flow and drainage;
         (2)    Interference with lateral supports and slopes;
         (3)    Causes erosion, alteration of the natural topography and grade
of land, depletion of natural deposits of topsoil and other natural materials,
disturbance of the plant and wildlife, creation of nuisances and potentially
dangerous slopes, walls or open pits or creation of stagnant water pools;
         (4)   Impacts upon the use of adjacent properties;
         (5)    Increases the height or duration of floodwater;
         (6)    Results in incompatible land uses or uses which would be
detrimental to the protection of surface and ground water supplies;
         (7)    Increases the financial burdens imposed on the community
through increasing water treatment costs, increasing floods and overflow of
water;
         (8)    Is inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land uses
compatible with the preservation of the natural landforms, vegetation, and the
wetlands within the community;
         (9)    Includes development of land and water areas essential to
continue the temporary withholding of rapid runoff of surface water which
presently contributes to downstream flooding or water pollution or for land and
water areas which provide ground water infiltration which diminishes the land
area necessary to carry increased flow or storm water following periods of
heavy precipitation.
A permit issued under this section shall expire one year from the date of
issuance, except that the County Engineer may, for good cause shown, extend any
permit for one-year periods after complete review of all plans and examination
of work accomplished and proposed, provided application is made at least thirty
days prior to the expiration date of such permit. In no case shall a permit be
extended if the provisions of this regulation have not been complied with,
provided, however, that in connection with continuing operations, the County
Engineer may waive, for one-year periods, those requirements which would make
continuing operations impractical.

   23.051 PERFORMANCE BONDS.
After review of a properly submitted application, the County Engineer shall
establish the amount of the performance bond, if any, and shall inform the
applicant of such required bond. Prior to the County Engineer’s approval of an
application requiring a performance bond, the Developer/Owner shall furnish the
performance bond to the County Executive. Performance bonds will generally be
required in an amount equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the
approved total cost of the improvements, but may vary based upon the amount
deemed sufficient to ensure completion of all work following excavation,
grading or filling pursuant to the conditions of approval. Performance bonds
shall be provided in the form of bonds issued by sureties or insurance
companies authorized to transact business in the State of Ohio by the Ohio
Department of Insurance, and as approved by the Director of the Department of
Law and Risk Management. In lieu of such bond, the County may accept a
certified or cashier's check in the same amount payable to the County.
Performance bonds will remain in effect until released by the County Executive.

damage to its facilities. Permits may be revoked by the Engineer at any time
for noncompliance with the conditions imposed.
      (4)    The permit shall be revocable at the discretion of the Engineer
upon a finding that the encroachment interferes with the operation or
maintenance of the drainage facility, or that the property owner failed to
maintain the permitted encroachments, and, upon termination of the permit, the
property owner shall remove such encroachment(s) at the property owner’s
expense within sixty (60) days of notification by the Engineer, without damage
to the property of the District or the Engineer. Should the permittee fail to
remove the encroachments and restore the area to the satisfaction of the County
within this time period, the County may remove and restore the area and charge
all related costs to the permittee.

943.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   The storm water system, including water management practices for
storage, treatment and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to
prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to
maintain predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the
following criteria:
      (1)   The storm water management practices shall function as an
integrated system that controls flooding and minimizes the degradation of the
physical, biological, and chemical integrity of the water resources receiving
storm water discharges from the site. Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project, and complies with Chapter
937 of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
      (2)   Areas developed for a subdivision, as defined in
Part 11 of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit, shall provide water
management and water quality controls for the development of all subdivided
lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent
structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm, and maintain, to the
extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks
from the lots.
      (3)   Storm water management practices and related activities shall not
be constructed in water resources unless the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps,
and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
943.07 of this Chapter, and the activity is in compliance with Chapters
937 and
941 of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit, all as determined by
the County Drainage Engineer.
      (4)   All storm water pond and storm conveyance designs must provide a
minimum of one (1) foot freeboard above the projected peak stage within the
facility during the 100-year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds
and conveyance channels the applicant shall include, to the extent practicable,
practices to address public safety concerns.
      (5)   The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted shall be
exempt from the requirements of Section
943.09 of this Chapter if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the County
Drainage Engineer that the site is part of a larger common plan of development
where the storm water management requirements for the site are provided by an
existing storm water management practice, equal to, or better than, that
required herein, or if the storm water management requirements for the site are
provided by practices defined in a regional or local storm water management
plan approved by the County Drainage Engineer.
      (6)   All storm water management practices shall be maintained in
accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by the County
Drainage Engineer as detailed in Section
943.08 of this Chapter.
      (7)   Unless otherwise required by the County, storm water management
practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot
held, where possible, and maintained by an entity of common ownership. For
those subdivisions that are subject to drainage maintenance assessments, as per
Section
1109.03(a) of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit, maintenance
shall be the responsibility of the County Drainage Engineer. Storm water
management practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots,
protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (8)   Practices that preserve and/or improve the existing natural
drainage shall be used to the maximum extent practicable. Such practices may
include minimizing site grading and compaction, protecting and/or restoring
water resources, riparian areas and existing vegetation, and maintaining
unconcentrated water runoff to and through these areas.
      (9)   Concentrated water runoff from BMPs to wetlands shall be converted
to diffuse flow before the runoff enters a wetland in order to protect the
natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and wetland flora. The flow shall be released
such that no erosion occurs down slope. Practices such as level spreaders,
vegetative buffers, infiltration basins, conservation of forest covers, and the
preservation of intermittent streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may
be used to maintain the wetland hydrology.
         If proposing to discharge to natural wetlands, the applicant shall
perform a hydrological analysis to demonstrate that the proposed discharge
matches the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics.
      (10)   The course of flow of storm water discharge from a facility shall
be shown to be adequate when such flow reaches a public stream or right-of-way.
Where such a course may cross land owned by another, an easement adequate
enough for maintenance access shall be provided.
 
   (b)   All water management practices shall be designed to convey storm water
to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   The County Drainage Engineer may allow the enclosure or relocation
of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all
appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other
applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
943.07 of this Chapter, and the activity is in compliance with Chapters
937 and
941 of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit, all as determined by
the County Drainage Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show
how the project will minimize changes to the vertical stability, floodplain
form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and downstream channels on and off
the property.
      (2)   Off-site storm water runoff that discharges onto, or across, the
applicant's development site shall be conveyed through the storm water
conveyance system planned for the development site at its existing peak flow
rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be diverted around the
post construction water quality practices or, if this is not possible, the post
construction water quality practices shall be sized to treat the off-site flow.
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved until it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the County Drainage Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through, and from, the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains sheet flow over
as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow shall be
determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the use of
easements or other legally binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading and/or
the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall the sheet
flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area exceed 1.5
acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other storm
water management practice from areas too long and/or too large to maintain
sheet flow, all as determined by the County Drainage Engineer.
      (4)   Unless otherwise allowed by the County Drainage Engineer, drainage
tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an open
channel with landscaped banks designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour storm
water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems shall be preferred on all new development
sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer systems shall be
allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities allowed under local
zoning requirements, or where the use of an open drainage system affects public
health or safety, all as determined by the County Drainage Engineer. The
following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributory area within the proposed
development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the
development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is twelve (12) inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private
systems, subject to the approval of the County Drainage Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   The following criteria shall be used to design structures that
cross a water resource in the County:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold
water habitat, exceptional warm water habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams.
         C.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
         D.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent (25%) of the cross-sectional area, or a minimum of one (1) foot of box
culverts and pipe arches, must be embedded below the channel bed.
         E.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         F.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         G.   Streams with a drainage area of five (5) square miles or larger
shall incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict
head loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-
year storm event.
         H.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve (12) inches.
         I.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a ten
(10) fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions.
Erosion protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to control
entrance and outlet velocities.
      (7)   Overland flood routing paths shall be used to convey storm water
runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate receiving water
resource or water management practice such that the runoff is contained within
the drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or other structures. The peak 100-year, 24-hour storm surface water
elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the
finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood routing
paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   In order to preserve floodplain storage volumes, and thereby avoid
increases in water surface elevations, any filling within floodplains approved
by the County must be compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material.
First consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes
should be given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to
the new floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration
will also be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to
compensate for floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the
contributing watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the County Drainage
Engineer, reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within
the legal boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory
storage areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the
disturbed area.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations, and along the length of any outfall, to provide non-erosive flow
velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics of the water resource are maintained and
protected.
 
   (c)   Storm Water Quality Control.
      (1)   The site shall be designed to direct runoff to one or more of the
following water quality practices which shall be designed to comply with the
current version of the Summit County Engineer Storm Water Drainage Manual:
         A.   Extended conveyance facilities that slow the rate of storm water
runoff, filter and biodegrade pollutants in storm water, promote infiltration
and evapotranspiration of storm water, and discharge the controlled runoff to a
water resource.
         B.   Extended detention facilities that detain storm water, settle or
filter particulate pollutants, and release the controlled storm water to a
water resource.
         C.   Infiltration facilities that retain storm water, promote
settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants. The County Drainage
Engineer may require a soil engineering report to be prepared for the site to
demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities meet these performance
standards.
         D.   For sites less than five (5) acres, but greater than one (1) acre
and not part of a common plan of development, where (1) or more acres are
disturbed, the County Drainage Engineer may approve other BMPs if the applicant
demonstrates to the County Drainage Engineer's satisfaction that these BMPs
meet the objectives of this Chapter.
         E.   For sites equal to or greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, the County Drainage Engineer may allow
alternative BMPs if the applicant demonstrates that these BMPs meet the
objectives of this Chapter and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         F.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the County Drainage Engineer may approve BMPs not included in this
Chapter, but they must show compliance with the current Ohio Department of
Transportation standards.
      (2)   Each BMP shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site. All BMPs must be
sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv), and to ensure compliance with
Ohio Water Quality Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1) and the latest revision of
the NPDES Construction Storm Water General Permit for Ohio.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities:
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility fall within hydrologic soil groups A or B, if the seasonal high water
table is at least three (3) feet below the final grade elevation, and any
underlying bedrock is at least six (6) feet below the final grade elevation.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities:
         A.   Facilities shall be lined with fine turf-forming, flood-tolerant
grasses.
         B.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention criteria shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than three (3) feet below the final grade
elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a two and five-tenths (2.5) foot deep layer of soil amendment with a
permeability equivalent to a HSG A or B soil, and an under drain system is
provided.
         C.   Facilities designed according to the flow through design drain
time criteria shall:
            1.   Only be allowed on sites where:
               a.   The total area disturbed is five (5) acres or less.
               b.   The discharge rate from the BMP will have negligible
hydrologic impacts to received waters as described in the most current version
of the Ohio EPA's General Permit for Storm Water Discharge from Small and Large
Construction Activities.
               c.   Prior written approval is given by the County Drainage
Engineer; and
               d.   For sites greater than five (5) acres or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale that will disturb
five (5) or more acres, prior written approval has been given by the Ohio EPA.
            2.   Be designed to slow and filter runoff flowing through the turf
grasses with a maximum depth of flow no greater than three (3) inches.
            3.   Be designed to have a minimum hydraulic residence time of five
(5) minutes.
         D.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow, or a
diffuse flow, using a plunge pool, flow diffuser, or level spreader, before
entering an extended conveyance facility designed according to the flow through
drain time.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities. Additional
criteria for extended detention facilities shall comply with the latest
revisions of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Soil and
Water Resources manual, Rainwater and Land Development, and the Summit County
Engineer Storm Water Drainage Manual.
 
   (d)   The Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan shall describe how the
proposed water management practices are designed to meet the following
requirements for storm water quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm, and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions, shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm, shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Calculate, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic methods approved by the County
Drainage Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-
hour storm occurring on the development drainage area before and after
development. These calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten (10) years and not only the
current land use.
            4.   Account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section
943.09 (d)(3)A, determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from the
latest revision of the Summit County Engineer Storm Water Drainage Manual.
 
   (e)   Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans for redevelopment projects
shall comply with the requirements of the most current version of the Ohio
EPA's permit, "General Construction Permit Authorization for Storm Water
Discharges associated with Construction Activity under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System".
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the County Drainage Engineer determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this Chapter, off-site alternatives that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water quantity may be
used. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Achieve the same level of storm water quantity and quality control
achieved by the on-site controls required under this Chapter.
      (2)   Implement the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watershed unit as the
proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   Establish an inspection and maintenance agreement, as described in
Section
943.08 (d)(10), to ensure perpetual maintenance.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
 
   (b)   Alternative actions require approval by the County Drainage Engineer.
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to storm water management practices as required by the County
Drainage Engineer for inspections and maintenance shall be secured by
easements. The following conditions shall apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the County Drainage Engineer prior to
approval of a final plat, and shall be recorded with the Summit County Fiscal
Officer, and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the County Drainage Engineer, access
easements between a public right-of-way and all storm water management
practices, including the outlet flow path, shall be no less than twenty-five
(25) feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an
additional twenty-five (25)-foot wide band around the perimeter of the storm
water management practice.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment access in and around each facility, as defined in the
Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   There shall be no construction of buildings, fences, walls, and other
structures, within the Easements that may obstruct the free flow of storm water
and the passage of inspectors and maintenance equipment, and no changes to the
final grading plan approved by the County. The County Drainage Engineer may
remove any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement
at the property owners' expense.
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed and provided to the County Drainage
Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent storm water
management and post construction water quality practices must be installed and
made functional, as determined by the County Drainage Engineer and per the
approved Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certificate, including an As-Built Survey and Inspection
Report, sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the storm water management and water
quality practices, as designed and installed, meet the requirements of the
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan approved by the County Drainage
Engineer. In evaluating this Certificate, the County Drainage Engineer may
require the submission of a new set of storm water practice calculations if he/
she determines that the design was altered significantly from the approved
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement, which will include the entity responsible for long-term maintenance,
as specified in Section
943.08.
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   Subdivisions. The County Drainage Engineer will perform ongoing
inspection and maintenance of all storm water control BMPs in subdivisions
assessed by the County for drainage maintenance.
 
   (b)   Single Lots. Owners of single lots, or lots not assessed for drainage
maintenance, shall be responsible for the ongoing inspection and maintenance of
all storm water control BMPs within those lots. Owners shall submit an annual
inspection and maintenance report to the County Drainage Engineer detailing all
the activities carried out in order to comply with the requirements of this
Chapter. The County Drainage Engineer will carry out inspections of these lots,
at reasonable intervals, but no more frequently than once per calendar year, to
ensure compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. The property owner
will be billed the actual cost of these inspections. Failure to submit an
annual report to the County Drainage Engineer, or any non-compliance found
during the inspections carried out by the County Drainage Engineer, constitutes
a violation of this Chapter and Section
943.17 of this Chapter will apply. Any non-compliant BMPs are subject to
additional inspections by the County Drainage Engineer at the property owner's
expense until the BMPs are compliant with this Chapter.
   The County Drainage Engineer reserves the right to have any third party
inspector, carry out inspections on its behalf.
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.14 FEES.
   (a)   At the Concept Plan Meeting, the applicant will pay a fee of two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the County Drainage Engineer.
 
   (b)   The County Drainage Engineer shall establish a fee based upon the
actual estimated cost for review, filing, and inspection. At the time of the
submittal of the Preliminary Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan, the
applicant will submit a deposit to the County Drainage Engineer to cover the
cost of at least fifty percent (50%) of the anticipated fee. The deposit,
submitted to the County Drainage Engineer, is required before the review
process begins. This deposit will reimburse the MVGT fund for actual expenses
as they occur during the review and inspection phases of the project. If and/or
when the amount of the deposit is at, or below, ten percent (10%) of the
original estimate, a further deposit of funds will be required to restore the
balance to fifty percent (50%) of the original anticipated fee. The County
Drainage Engineer may halt review until a sufficient deposit is restored.
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.15 BOND.
   (a)   A performance and maintenance bond shall be posted according to the
County of Summit Subdivision Regulations. No project will be released from the
bond if there is failure to comply with the requirements of this Chapter. The
bond will be returned, less Summit County administrative fees as detailed in
Section
943.14 of this Chapter, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After eighty percent (80%) of the lots of the project have been
complete and one hundred percent (100%) of the total project has been
permanently stabilized for three (3) years.
      (2)   The County Drainage Engineer has conducted an as-built inspection
of all storm water management and water quality practices.
      (3)   The County Drainage Engineer has accepted an Inspection and
Maintenance Agreement signed by the developer, the contractor, the County, and
the private owner or homeowners association who will take long-term
responsibility for these BMPs.
 
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If any of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
Summit County may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
storm water management structures on the site. Any remainder of the bond shall
be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for the purpose of
long-term maintenance of the project. Should such outstanding issues exceed the
bond amount, the County shall invoice the applicant accordingly.
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the County Drainage Engineer and Summit SWCD. This occurs after
the completion of the final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are
installed, and the site is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other
appropriate methods. The developer must provide documentation acceptable to the
County Drainage Engineer to demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized.
Upon this proof of compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed
and placed into service. Upon completion of installation of these practices,
all disturbed areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these
practices must be stabilized within two (2) days.
(Ord. 2013-364. Adopted 8-26-13.)
 
943.17 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated
any of the provisions of this Chapter, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this Chapter, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this Chapter or in violation of any permit granted under
this Chapter.
 
   (b)   If, after a period of not less than thirty (30) days has elapsed
following the issuance of a notice of violation, the violation continues, the
County Drainage Engineer shall issue a second notice of violation. Except as
provided in division (d) of this Section, if, after a period of not less than
fifteen (15) days has elapsed following the issuance of the second notice of
violation, the violation continues, the County Drainage Engineer shall issue a
stop work order, if appropriate, and may undertake the necessary repairs and
assess the responsible party.
 
   (c)   Each violation of this chapter shall result in a civil fine of not
less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more than five hundred dollars
($500.00). Each day of violation of a rule or stop work order issued under this
Chapter shall be considered a separate violation subject to a civil fine.
 
   (d)   In addition to any fines, the Summit County Prosecutor may seek an
injunction, or other appropriate relief.
 
   (e)   No stop work order shall be issued under this section against any
public highway, transportation, or drainage improvement or maintenance project
undertaken by a government agency or political subdivision in accordance with
its standard policies that are approved by the County or the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources' Division of Soil and Water Resources.
 
   (f)   The Summit County Department of Building Standards may suspend the
issuance of occupancy certificates within developments that do not comply with

containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable
water quality standards, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct or
continuance of any illegal discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except described
as follows:
      (1)    The following discharges are exempt from the discharge
prohibitions established by this Chapter: water line flushing or other potable
water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows,
rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated
pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawlspace pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
non-commercial washing of vehicles, street wash water, natural riparian habitat
or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated – typically less than one
PPM chlorine), firefighting activities and any other water source not
containing pollutants.
      (2)    Discharges specified in writing by the County Engineer as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)    Discharges from off-lot household sewage treatment systems
permitted by the Summit County Combined General Health District for the purpose
of discharging sewage effluent in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code §
3701-29-02 until such time as the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issues
an NPDES permitting mechanism for residential 1, 2, or 3-family dwellings.
These discharges are exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a
public health nuisance by the Summit County Combined General Health District.
In compliance with NPDES Permit #OHQ000001, or subsequent versions thereof,
discharges from all off-lot discharging household sewage systems must either be
eliminated or have coverage under an appropriated NPDES permit issued and
approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit coverage
is available, discharges from the off-lot discharging household sewage
treatment systems will no longer be exempt from the requirement of this
Chapter.
      (4)    Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
      (5)    The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (b)    Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to an MS4 is prohibited.
      (2)    This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of the
connection.
      (3)    A person is considered in violation of this Chapter if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to an MS4 or allows such a connection to be
made.
         (Ord. 2021-347. Adopted 11-22-21.)
   
944.07 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)    Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
County Engineer may, without notice, suspend discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or the waters of the State
of Ohio. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the Engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the State of Ohio or to minimize danger
to persons.
   (b)    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to an MS4 in violation of this Chapter may have their storm
drainage access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The County Engineer will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without
the approval of the County Engineer. (Ord. 2021-347. Adopted 11-22-21.)
944.08 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SWPPP and/or
NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the County Engineer prior to allowing discharges to an MS4.
(Ord. 2021-347. Adopted 11-22-21.)
944.09  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)    Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial, residential, institutional, or
commercial activity, including construction activity.
   (b)    Access to Facilities.
      (1)    The County Engineer shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this Chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this Chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)    Facility operators shall allow the County Engineer ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES
permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties
as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)    The County Engineer shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the County
Engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water
discharge.
      (4)    The County Engineer shall have the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (5)    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall promptly be removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
      (6)    Unreasonable delays in allowing the County Engineer access to a
permitted facility is in violation of a storm water discharge permit and this
Chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a SWPPP or NPDES
permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the County Engineer reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this Chapter.
      (7)    If the County Engineer has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and the County Engineer is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there has been a violation of
this Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
Chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the County Engineer may, through the
County Prosecutor, seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 2021-347. Adopted 11-22-21.)
944.10 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY THE
USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   Chapter
943 of the Codified Ordinances, entitled “Comprehensive Storm Water
Management,” has adopted requirements identifying Best Management Practices
(“BMPs”) for activities, operations or facilities which may cause or contribute
to the pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or
waters of the State of Ohio. The owner or operators of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge or prohibited materials or other wastes
into an MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs.
(Ord. 2021-347. Adopted 11-22-21.)
944.11 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. When the County Engineer finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this regulation, the
County Engineer may order compliance by written Notice of Violation. Such
notice must specify the violation and shall be hand delivered, and/or sent by
registered mail, to the owner/operator of the facility or property.
Such notice may require the following actions:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit discharges or illegal connections;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; or
      (5)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility or property owner/operator fail to remediate or
restore within the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be
initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing: Any person aggrieved or adversely affected by
any action taken or determination made under this Chapter may request a hearing
before the County Engineer pursuant to the Appeals Process set forth in
Codified Ordinance Section
 942.11. Any further proceedings shall be held pursuant to that section.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation. Enforcement may be brought pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3767.04, or any
other applicable provision of law. If an owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the County Engineer may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/
operator from activities that would create further violations or compelling the
owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
(Ord. 2021-347. Adopted 11-22-21.)
944.12 REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies listed in this regulation are not exclusive of any other
remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is
in the discretion of the County Engineer to seek cumulative remedies

   (b)   Concept Plan Stage Procedure.  The purpose of the Concept Plan Stage
is to hold a review meeting to provide advice and assistance concerning the
proposed Subdivision so the Developer may prepare a complete Preliminary Plan
and Final Plat consistent with the requirements of the County Subdivision
Regulations. A Concept Plan review meeting provides an opportunity to discuss
the review process, the scope of appropriate submittal requirements and
compliance with the County Subdivision Regulations. Potential problems may be
identified before a formal Preliminary Plan is submitted. Also a Concept Plan
review process provides a mechanism for effectively coordinating needed street
connections. Prior to submitting a Concept Plan application to Staff, the
Developer shall beet with the County Engineer for the Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan and compliance with the Access Management Manual.
      (1)   Submission of Concept Plan. The Developer or Agent of the Developer

         B.   Five (5) copies of concept plan drawing folded to approximately
9”x 12”size.
         C.   Other information that the Staff may request to assist in
understanding issues of the proposed subdivision.
The Concept Plan discussion meeting shall be scheduled within fourteen (14)
working days from the date of submission of the applicant’s form and materials.
The formal meeting may be waived by the Planning Commission, if, after review
of the application, it is determined to be unnecessary due to the limited
nature, or impact of the project. If additional information is requested, the
fourteen-day period may be extended.
      (2)   Transmission of Concept Plan. The Staff shall transmit at least one
(1) copy of the Concept Plan to the following officials and agencies for their

         A.   Upon determination by the Staff that the Preliminary Plan has
been properly submitted, the Preliminary Plan shall be accepted as being
officially filed. Official filing shall take place a minimum of twenty (20)
working days prior to the Planning Commission's regularly scheduled meeting for
consideration of Major Subdivisions. The Staff shall not accept a Preliminary
Plan as being officially filed if it is missing any of the required
information. However, where it appears to the Staff that the Developer can
reasonably produce the missing information within a short time, the Staff may
grant the Developer up to five (5) additional working days to produce the
additional information. The Planning Commission need not consider a Preliminary
Plan unless it is officially filed.
         B.   Following official filing, and at least ten (10) days prior to
consideration of the Preliminary Plan by the Planning Commission, written
notice shall be mailed by Staff, by first class mail, to all owners of property
contiguous to and directly across the street from such area proposed to be
developed. The notice shall state the date, time and location of the Planning
Commission meeting at which the preliminary plan for the proposed development
will be considered.
      (5)   Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission shall approve,
approve conditionally, or disapprove the Preliminary Plan. The Planning
Commission may take time and delay its decision on the Preliminary Plan until
the next regularly scheduled meeting, and may take additional time only upon
request or permission by the Developer. The action shall be conveyed in writing
to the Developer and all reviewing agencies that Staff deems necessary. The
action shall also be entered on the official records of the Planning Commission
and a copy of the Preliminary Plan and action taken will be kept on file with
Staff.
      (6)   Effect of Approval. An approved Preliminary Plan is to be used as a
guide for the preparation of Improvement Plans and for the preparation of a
Subdivision Plat for final approval and recording upon fulfillment of all
conditions of preliminary approval and all requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations. Approval of a Preliminary Plan shall be effective for a period of
two (2) years following the date of approval unless an extension of time is
granted in writing by the Planning Commission. In the event conditional
approval of a Preliminary Plan is granted by the Planning Commission, such
approval shall expire within six (6) months from the date of conditional
approval, unless all conditions required as part of the conditional approval
have been satisfied as determined by Staff and applicable agencies during said
period. Preliminary Plans for which conditions have been satisfied are
effective for a period of two (2) years following the date of conditional
approval unless an extension of time is granted in writing by the Planning
Commission.
      (7)   Extension of Preliminary Plan Approval. In cases where regulatory
conditions and requirements have not been fully addressed or met by the
expiration of the approval and where the Developer is legitimately pursuing
approvals, the Planning Commission may grant up to two (2) one-year extensions.
For each extension requested, the Township Zoning Inspector must sign and date
the Preliminary Plan to indicate that it still meets the local Zoning
Regulations, in order for the extension request to be reviewed by the Planning
Commission. If after all the extensions have been exhausted, any phase(s) or
portion(s) of the original approved Preliminary Plan has not received Final
Plat approval, then a new Preliminary Plan shall be submitted for Planning
Commission approval. When a subdivision is proposed to be developed in phases,
the Preliminary Plan approval will automatically be extended for one (1) year
from the Final Plat approval date of a phase.
      (8)   Expiration of Preliminary Plan Approval. Upon expiration of a
Preliminary Plan approval, no approval of a Final Plat shall be given until the
Preliminary Plan has been resubmitted and approved. Construction shall not
begin until the Improvement Plans have been approved by the County Engineer and
where applicable, Department of Sanitary Sewer Services, County Executive and
the OEPA.
      (9)   Changes in Preliminary Plan. During the preparation of Improvement
Plans, technical reasons may necessitate the modification of the approved
Preliminary Plan. Whenever modifications would substantially change between the
Final Plat and the approved Preliminary Plan, the change shall be submitted to
Staff for consideration. Substantial changes include road or major easement
reconfiguration, increase in the number of lots, or decrease in the area or
change in the specified use of blocks. Within fifteen (15) working days after
receipt of the notification of the change and with consultation with
appropriate agencies, Staff will:
         A.   Give written approval for the modifications, or
         B.   Give written notice that the proposed modifications must be
reviewed by the Planning Commission at its next scheduled public meeting.
   (d)   Improvement Plan Stage Procedure. The Improvement Plan Stage requires
the Developer to present engineering Improvement Plans to the County Engineer
and to the Department of Sanitary Sewer Services, where applicable. The
Developer's Engineer shall prepare Improvement Plans which shall conform to the
approved Preliminary Plan and include all phases of the work to be performed to
make the land suitable for development into the use proposed. These plans shall
be complete and precise in all details. When sanitary sewer or water mains are

   Three (3) copies shall be submitted to the Engineer and three (3) copies to
the Department of Sanitary Sewer Services, where applicable. The Improvement
Plans shall include three copies of the SWPPP for review and approval by Summit
Soil and Water. The requirements for the SWPPP are listed in Section
1105.07(b). In a situation when the final design has been modified after
approval of the SWPPP by Summit Soil and Water, the Developer is responsible
for resubmitting a revised SWPPP to Summit Soil and Water for review and
approval. Summit Soil and Water shall send a copy of the approved SWPPP along
with the letter of approval to the County Engineer. A copy shall be marked and
returned to the Developer's Engineer for corrections if necessary. If found to
be satisfactory, the original mylar shall be submitted for approval signature
by the County Engineer and Department of Sanitary Sewer Services, where
applicable. Two (2) copies shall be submitted to the Township for information
only. One (1) copy of the Improvement Plans shall be submitted to County
Engineer in digital format. (See,

construction, and before acceptance, the Developer’s Engineer shall update the
original Improvement Plan sheets as directed by the County Engineer and
Department of Sanitary Sewer Services, where applicable, showing the locations,
sizes, and elevations of all improvements as constructed (hereafter “As- Built
drawings”). A legible paper original of the As-Built drawings shall be
furnished to the Department of Sanitary Sewer Services, where applicable. The
original plan sheets shall remain with the County Engineer. All final As-Built

at least fifteen (15) working days prior to consideration by the Planning
Commission at their regularly scheduled meeting. Upon determination by the
Planning Commission that the Final Plat has been properly submitted, the
Planning Commission shall accept the Final Plat as being Officially Filed and
shall certify the official filing date on the copies.
   (h)   Planning Commission Action. If the Final Plat application is complete,
the Planning Commission shall review the Final Plat within thirty (30) days
after submission of the Final Plat.
      (1)   Planning Commission Action. One of the following actions shall be
taken by the Planning Commission:
         A.   Final Approval. Prior to the granting of approval of the Final
Plat, the Developer shall have received official approval from all applicable
authorities of the Preliminary Plan and Improvement Plans. Planning
Commission’s approval is also contingent upon Summit Soil and Water’s approval
of the SWPPP and the Developer’s compliance with the approved SWPPP for all
phases of the project if the site is under construction. The Final Plat must
conform to the approved Preliminary Plan, and all other applicable Regulations.
Construction may begin only to the extent permitted pursuant to Chapter
1110 of these Subdivision Regulations.
The Planning Commission may give final approval before the required
Improvements are installed, authorizing its Chairperson, or any other officer
of the Planning Commission, to indicate such approval and date on the tracing
mylar of the Final Plat (Refer to Chapter
1110 Requirements for Construction of Improvements for these requirements).
         B.   Disapproval. Should the Planning Commission determine to
disapprove the Final Plat, written notice of such action shall be mailed to the
Developer and his/her engineer and/or surveyor. The notice shall contain
specific reference to regulations or other requirements with which the Final
Plat does not comply. The action shall also be entered in the official records
of the Planning Commission.
         C.   Approval without Planning Commission Action. In the event the
Planning Commission shall fail to act upon the Final Plat within thirty (30)
calendar days of the date of its Official Filing, or within a time extension
mutually agreed upon between the Developer and the Planning Commission, the
Final Plat shall be deemed to have been approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Effect of Approval. Final Approval of a Final Plat by the Planning
Commission shall not be an acceptance by the public of the offer to dedicate
any street, highway, or other public ways, or open space upon the Final Plat
until such acceptance is also endorsed by the County Council upon the tracing
of the Final Plat. The Planning Commission final approval shall automatically
expire if the Final Plat is not presented to the County Council for final
approval within two (2) years of the Planning Commission's Preliminary Plan
approval. Before the Final Plat may be considered for approval by County
Council, the Developer shall furnish to the County Executive Bonds as required
by Section
1110.04.

1105.01 GENERAL PURPOSE.
   After a proposed Subdivision has received all necessary Township review and
approvals per the local Township Zoning Resolution, and comments have been
received from applicable Township departments for design consideration, review
of general Subdivision and site design falls under the jurisdiction of the
Planning Commission. The purpose of good Subdivision site design is to protect
the public health, safety and general welfare of the County and to create a
functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to
ensure that a project will be an asset to the County. To promote this purpose,
these Subdivision Regulations shall set forth requirements for the manner in
which streets, lots and other elements of a proposed Subdivision shall be
arranged on the land. Improvements required by these Subdivision Regulations
shall facilitate convenient and safe streets and usable lots, and shall reserve
adequate space for public utilities, as well as recreational, institutional,
and other public uses.  
   The development shall be designed to avoid adversely affecting groundwater
and aquifer recharge, to reduce cut and fill; to avoid unnecessary impervious
cover; to prevent flooding; and to provide adequate access to lots and sites.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1105.02 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Planning Commission determines that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to poor drainage, flood hazard,
topography, inadequate water supply, landslip potential, unstable subsurface
conditions due to underground mining, hazardous waste contamination or other
reasons and other such conditions which may endanger the health, life, safety,
public welfare or property; and if by any public regulatory agencies concerned,
it is determined that in the best interest of the public, the land should not
be developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning Commission shall not
approve the Subdivision unless appropriate and adequate methods for solving the
problems are provided by the Developer.
   (a)    Soils. The Planning Commission shall require a Developer to submit a
detailed soils study in specified areas of a proposed Subdivision, where, as
determined by Summit Soil and Water or the County Engineer, existing soil
conditions in a proposed Subdivision are severe and may require adjustments in
design to compensate for existing conditions. This Study may be required as
part of Preliminary Plan approval. The Study shall recommend corrective
measures necessary to compensate for existing conditions in the proposed
Subdivision and shall be reviewed and approved by Summit Soil and Water, the
Department of Sanitary Sewer Services, the Division of Building Standards and
other relevant County Departments.
The following note may be required on the Final Plat to acknowledge development
issues or restrictions: "Note: Prior to the construction of the footing/
foundation for the building to be constructed on each of the lots, the builder
of such building shall confer with the Division of Building Standards for the
purpose of determining if special foundation and/or basement construction
techniques and/ or materials are to be employed on such lot."
   (b)    Flood Hazard. The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps should be used to
determine if land is in a flood area. The Developer shall show the 100-year
flood boundary be shown on the topographic map for the Subdivision. If any
portion of the land within the Subdivision is subject to flooding or other
hazards, due consideration shall be given to such problems in the design of the
Subdivision and the flood plain must be shown on the Preliminary Plans,
Improvement Plans and Final Plat. Land subject to flooding and land otherwise
uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for such other
uses that may increase danger to health, life, or property, or aggravate the
flood hazard as delineated on the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, or detailed
engineering study. Furthermore, building areas are not encouraged in the
Floodway Fringe.
   (c)    Wetlands. All wetlands will be delineated by a qualified professional
per Section
1104.04(c)(2)K. and the wetlands boundary and their associated setbacks
identified on the Preliminary Plan. The full wetlands delineation study shall
be completed and approved as part of the Improvement Plan Stage. The delineated
wetlands and their associated setbacks and the Category 2 and/or Category 3
determination shall be identified on the Improvement Plans and the Final Plat.
If the wetlands will be impacted in a manner exceeding the limits of current
law, the Developer is responsible to contact the USACE and the OEPA, the two
agencies having jurisdiction over wetlands. The Developer is responsible for
securing wetland Development permits from the USACE and OEPA. Summit Soil and
Water has resources available to identify potential wetlands.
(1)   Land to be subdivided or developed should be designed and improved in a
way that impacts to wetlands are minimized. Grading or removal of vegetative
cover is not permitted within thirty (30) feet of a Category 2 wetland, and
fifty (50) feet of a Category 3 wetland, unless a Section 404 permit to fill
has been obtained from the USACE and all permit approvals have been obtained
from the OEPA. The required buffer setbacks should be placed in a no-build
reserve on the Preliminary Plan, Final Plat, and Minor Subdivision drawings. A
Conservation Easement should be developed and deeded over to a government
agency, a qualifying conservation or historic preservation organization, or
homeowner's association. Copies of all USACE and OEPA Wetland Permit
Information and Mitigation Plans shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission,
Staff, Summit Soil and Water, the County Engineer and appropriate Township.
(2)   There are no wetland buffer setbacks required for Category 1 wetlands.
This category of wetlands is defined by the OEPA as wetlands that have minimal
habitat and minimal hydrologic and recreation functions. Category 2 wetlands
are defined by the OEPA as wetlands that have moderate habitat or moderate
hydrology and recreation functions. Category 3 wetlands are defined by the OEPA
as wetlands that have superior habitat or superior hydrologic or recreation
functions.
(3)   If other local wetland ordinances or resolutions are adopted that would
supersede state or federal regulations, then the most stringent of the wetland
protection and buffering Regulations will apply.
   (d)   Riparian Setbacks. Development shall be subject to the requirements of
Chapter
937 of these Ordinances establishing Riparian Setbacks within the County of
Summit. (See,
Appendix J, County of Summit Riparian Ordinance)
      (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16; Ord.
2023-339. Adopted 11-27-23.)
1105.03 SUBDIVISION AND SITE DESIGN.
   Design of the Subdivision shall consider existing county, township and
regional comprehensive plans and shall be based on analysis of site
characteristics. To the maximum extent practicable, development shall be
located to preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of
environmental sensitivity and to minimize negative impacts and alterations of
natural features and habitat to the extent consistent with the reasonable
utilization of land and in accordance with state, local or federal regulations
including but not limited to the following:
   (a)   Unique or fragile areas, including wetlands, as may be defined in
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended, and in OEPA standards.
   (b)   Land in the Floodway and Floodway Fringe as identified and mapped
using the FEMA's Flood Hazard Boundary Maps.
   (c)   Steep slopes in excess of eighteen (18) percent unless appropriate
engineering measures concerning slope stability, erosion and resident safety
are taken into account.
   (d)   Habitats of endangered wildlife, as identified on federal and state
lists.
   (e)   Historically and culturally significant structures and sites, as
listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
   (f)   Land located within 100 feet of an existing oil or gas well, 200 feet
from an existing tank battery and 50 feet from a proposed street pavement edge
to an existing oil or gas well and/or an existing tank battery shall remain
undeveloped.
   (g)   Riparian Setbacks per Chapter
937 of these Codified Ordinances or applicable township zoning.
      (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1105.04 BLOCKS.
   (a)    Residential Block Lengths. The long dimension of a residential block
shall not exceed one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet.
   (b)    Commercial or Industrial Blocks. Blocks intended to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed specifically for such uses
with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading facilities as
required by the applicable zoning.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08.)
1105.05 LOTS.
   (a)    Zoning Conformance. The lot size, width, depth, and the minimum
Building Setback Lines shall conform to the minimum requirements of the
existing Township Zoning Regulations.
   (b)    Double-Frontage Lot. Lots shall be laid out so that there are no
double-frontages except:
(1)   Where extreme conditions in elevation prevent access to the lot from one
(1) of the streets;
(2)   Where it is necessary to separate residential lots from major arterial
thoroughfares. Where double-frontage lots are created adjacent to arterial
thoroughfares, a minimum twenty (20) foot wide reserve strip along the arterial
thoroughfares shall be deeded to the County of Summit. The Final Plat shall
state that there shall be no right of access across such reserve strip. The
Planning Commission may require buffering per Section
1106.06.
   (c)    Lot Lines. Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial
to street lines. Lot lines should follow municipal, township and county
boundary lines rather than cross them.
   (d)    Lot Depth. No lot depth shall exceed four and one-half (4½) times the
lot width unless otherwise required by local zoning resolutions. The lot width
shall be measured at the minimum building setback line. This also applies to
Section
1103.03(a).
   (e)    Access to Public Streets. Unless otherwise permitted herein, the
subdividing of land whether as a Major or Minor Subdivision, shall provide each
lot with a minimum of fifty (50) thirty (30) feet of continuous frontage on a
dedicated street. Access to public streets shall comply with the Access
Management Manual.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1105.06 EASEMENTS.
   (a)    Easements in General. Adequate easements along rear or side lot lines
shall be provided for utilities and drainage where necessary. A ten (10) foot
easement on each front lot line for utilities is required.
   (b)    Stormwater and Drainage Easements. A drainage easement shall be
provided, where a Subdivision is traversed by a, new or improved ditch, storm
sewers or detention and retention basins that were constructed as part of the
development and post construction water quality practices. The easement width
shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet or as the County Engineer and Planning
Commission may require. The easement width for the major (100-year) storm path
shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet wide. The easement width for the
overland floodways shall be dependent upon the width of the channel plus any
operational space deemed necessary by the County Engineer.
   (c)    Fire Pond Easements. Easements shall be provided as may be required
for fire ponds and related appurtenances.
   (d)    Utility Lines. All utility lines shall be located underground.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1105.07 MASTER GRADING PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Grading Plan. A master grading plan shall be a part of required
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan and Improvement Plans for all Major
Subdivisions and may be required for other proposals. This grading plan shall
show contour lines at two (2) foot intervals, with stormwater best management
practice details at one (1) foot intervals. Elevations are to be based on the
NAVD88, and the grading plan shall show:
(1)   Existing and proposed contour lines.
(2)   Yard swales.
(3)   Minimum building envelope and other spot elevations.
(4)   Lot layout and lot dimensions.
(5)   Finished grade of streets.
(6)   Stormwater management features and major storm routing path (if
applicable, include fire pond).
   (b)    Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan. 
(1)   SWPPP. When the Developer intends to remove or disturb the natural
topsoil, trees, and other vegetation, and/or add impervious surfaces, or where
the Developer intends to change the surface contour of a proposed Subdivision,
he/she shall prepare a SWPPP and have such plan approved by the Summit Soil and
Water prior to the commencement of earthwork. The SWPPP shall be included in
the improvement drawings and the Stormwater Management Plan. In general,
erosion and sediment control work will consist of phasing construction,
minimizing disturbed areas, timely application of temporary and permanent
seeding, and the installation of temporary structural erosion and post-
construction best management sediment control practices as specified in Chapter
941 of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit. The SWPPP shall also
include the design of permanent structural and non-structural post construction
water quality practices their associated long term maintenance agreement.
Summit Soil and Water has developed a check list to assist with the creation of
the SWPPP which is included in
Appendix L.
(2)   Storm Water Management. When impervious surfaces are proposed for a
development project, the Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan shall
include all structural and non-structural features that convey, detain, retain,
infiltrate, and filter storm water runoff to manage and treat storm water
runoff both as to quantity and quality from the development site as specified
in Chapter
943 of the Codified Ordinances of the County of Summit and the Summit County
Engineer's Stormwater Drainage Manual. Practices may include retention and
detention basins, swales, ditches, storm sewer pipes and storm water inlets and
post construction water quality practices.
(3)   Inspection. The County Engineer and the Summit Soil and Water will have
the work inspected to insure that the Developer has complied with the approved
plans or necessary environmental conditions. Summit Soil and Water will provide
site inspections to verify compliance with the SWPPP. Failure to comply with
the plan may result in enforcement. The County Engineer may take necessary
steps to provide corrective measures, and the cost of such services will be
charged to the Developer. This does not relieve the Developer or contractor of
any liability that may arise. No project will be released from Bond if there is
failure to comply with an approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan
unless the Developer has performed cleanup and repair of damages. Final
inspection requires all drainage facilities to be free of deposits from
erosion, siltation and construction debris. The Preliminary Plan(s) for
subsequent phases and proposed Final Plat(s) will be disapproved if there are
compliance issues on any phase of a development. (Also refer to Inspection
Requirements per Section
1110.07(c)).

1106.01 OPEN SPACE DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The purpose of the Regulations is to set forth requirements to protect
the public health, safety and welfare by providing for the park, Open Space and
other such recreation needs of new residents by equitably apportioning the
costs of providing sites for parks, recreation facilities, linear greenway and
trail systems.
(1)    Dedication Requirement. The requirements of this section shall apply to
Major Residential Subdivisions. Land dedications or permanent conservation
easements shall be dedicated to Summit County Metro Parks, Township Park
District, Owners' Association, Land Trust, Board of Township Trustees or other
public entity. Land obtained under these requirements shall only be used for
Open Space, parks, trails, playgrounds, play fields, swimming pools, or other
passive or active recreational purposes.
The land dedication requirement for Open Space, Parks and Recreation facilities
shall be calculated in accordance with the following Table:
Table 1. Recreation Requirements
 
AVERAGE SIZE OF          PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LAND IN SUBDIVISION
RESIDENTIAL LOT          TO BE RESERVED
                         FOR RECREATION PURPOSES
80,000 sq. ft. & greater 1.5%
50,000 sq. ft.           2.5%
40,000 sq. ft.           3.0%
35,000 sq. ft.           3.5%
25,000 sq. ft.           5.0%
15,000 sq. ft.           8.0 %
 
(2)    Set-Aside Credits. In determining the amount of land to be set aside by
Developers for recreational purposes, the following credits shall be given:
A.   Full acreage credit for Open Space areas preserved to be used in
fulfilling the Major Subdivision Park and Open Space land dedication
requirements.
B.   Full acreage credit to be used in fulfilling their Major Subdivision Park
and Open Space land dedication requirements for Riparian Setback Areas
protected through conservation easements or donated to a Public Parks System.
C.   Full credit shall be given for trails, linear parks and greenways the
Planning Commission may require as a condition of Final Plat approval the
dedication of multi-purpose trails and linear parks.
D.   Credit may be included for stormwater retention wet ponds and/ or fire
ponds that are incorporated in Park and Open Space land dedication provided
that such areas or facilities are safe, accessible and useable as community
amenities by the public or residents of the Subdivision (e.g., picnic areas,
playgrounds, ponds for fishing and/or boating).
E.   Full credit shall be given for the preservation of Category 2 and Category
3 wetlands with required buffers. Category 1 wetlands shall be calculated at a
maximum eighty percent (80%) set aside credit. (Refer to Section
1105.02(c)(2) for description of wetlands categories).
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16; Ord. 2023-339.
Adopted 11-27-23.)
1106.02 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS.
   Land set aside for Park and Open Space uses shall meet the following design
criteria:
(a)   Open Space land shall front onto a road in the Subdivision for a distance
of at least fifty (50) feet unless part of a greenway or trail connection. This
requirement shall be waived if the Open Space shall adjoin and become a part of
an already existing adjacent Park or Open Space area which is accessible from a
public street.
(b)   Open Space land shall be compact and contiguous unless the land shall be
used as continuation of an existing trail or linear park or specific
topographic features require a different configuration. An example of such
topographic features would be the provision of Open Space along a scenic creek
or stream.
(c)   When land required to be dedicated or set aside is less than three (3)
acres in size, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, the Open Space
land may be located at a suitable place on the periphery of the Subdivision or
land development so a more usable tract will result when additional Open Space
land is obtained or set aside when adjacent land is developed.
(d)   When Park and Open Space land exists adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided or developed, Open Space land shall, to the maximum extent feasible,
be located to adjoin and enlarge the presently existing Park and Open Space
land.
(e)   When a Preliminary Plan includes multiple phases, each separate phase
must contain a proportionate amount of required Open Space unless the Open
Space for all phases is being recorded in the first phase Final Plat.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16; Ord. 2023-339.
Adopted 11-27-23.)
1106.03 FEE-IN-LIEU OF DEDICATION.
   As an alternative to dedicating land per Section
1106.01(a)(1), and only with the approval of the Planning Commission, the
Developer may pay a fee-in-lieu of the Dedication.
(a)   Criteria.
(1)   A useable parcel of land does not exist in the subject Subdivision or for
some other reason, land dedication is inappropriate or infeasible; or
(2)   Summit Metro Parks, or other public recreation agency with authority in
the Subdivision, recommends the payment of a fee-in-lieu of land dedication.
(3)   The fee-in-lieu of land dedication amount shall be determined as follows:
 
                    Land area that would otherwise
Fee-in-lieu of land be required to be provided as
dedication =        determined by Section          X Fair Market Value
                    1106.01 (b)(1) of this
                    Chapter.
Fair Market Value shall equal the average value per acre of all land in the
proposed Subdivision in its raw undeveloped state as determined by one of the
following procedures:
A.   The current per acre land transaction price of the Subdivision property as
recorded or as stated in the Option to Purchase Agreement, provided the land
transaction or Agreement is less than two (2) years old at the time of Final
Plat filing for the first phase of the Subdivision, or
B.   The current per acre land value as determined by a professional appraiser
selected by the Summit County Planning Commission approved and paid for by the
Developer.
(b)    Parks and Recreation Fund.  
(1)   A fee-in-lieu of a land dedication, per Section
1106.01(c), shall be paid to the Planning Commission after approving the Final
Plat for the first phase of a Subdivision along with the Performance and/or
Maintenance Bond, before the plat is recorded. The fee in- lieu of land
dedication monies shall be deposited in a special fund administered by the
County Fiscal Officer entitled "Parks and Recreation Fund." The County Fiscal
Officer shall have a separate account for these funds for each Township, and
track these funds by Subdivision in each Township.
Such "Parks and Recreation Fund" monies shall be used only for the acquisition
or development of public land for parks, playgrounds, trails, greenways, nature
preserves, recreational facilities, open space, or for the retirement of debt
incurred for such purposes.
(2)   Funds generated through development of a particular Subdivision must be
applied within five (5) years of receipt by the Planning Commission for
eligible uses that will benefit the Subdivision for which the fee was
collected. The designated agent of the Township in which the "Parks and
Recreation Fund" was created shall make written request to the Planning
Commission Staff to place a request to appropriate all or some portion of
monies from a "Parks and Recreation Fund" created hereunder on the agenda of
the Planning Commission. The Township written request shall state reasonably
specific reasons for the request including but not limited to the amount of
money requested, the intended use for the requested funds, the governmental
authority who has oversight jurisdiction for any proposed project or is legally
responsible for administration of any released funds, the location of the
dedicated recreational land to be improved or acquired and the contemplated
date of project completion. The Planning Commission shall then approve,
disapprove or conditionally approve the request to appropriate monies from a
"Parks and Recreation Fund" by formal vote. If the request to appropriate is
approved or conditionally approved, the Planning Commission's motion shall
direct the County Fiscal Officer on how these funds will be distributed to
benefit the new Subdivision residents in the Township.
(3)   Prohibition. No Final Plat shall be signed by the County and recorded by
the Developer unless and until a deed for conveyance of a park, recreation or
open space reserve has been reviewed and approved by the County Department of
Law or in the case of a fee-in-lieu of dedication, the fee payment has been
fully deposited into the Parks and Recreation Fund account.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16; Ord. 2023-339.
Adopted 11-27-23.)
1106.04 OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE OF OPEN SPACE.
   (a)    Provisions for Ownership. The Planning Commission will review the
form of ownership being proposed for any permanently dedicated Open Space, or
Common Areas (including areas reserved for designated public use). The type of
ownership may include:
(1)   Dedicated to a public entity, subject to the entity's acceptance;
(2)   Owned jointly or in common by the owners with an Owners' Association;
(3)   Owned by a quasi-public organization, such as a non-profit land trust.
   (b)    Prohibition of Further Subdivision of Restricted Open Space. Any
lands dedicated for Open Space, park or other public purpose in a residential
Subdivision (including conventional or planned residential developments) shall
have appropriate covenants, bylaws, conservation easements and/ or deed
restrictions reviewed and approved by the County Department of Law and filed
with the Final Plat and recorded with the County ensuring that:
(1)   The Open Space, park, or other public purpose area will not be further
subdivided in the future;
(2)   The use of the Open Space, park or other public purpose land will
continue in perpetuity for the purpose specified;
(3)   Appropriate provisions will be made for the maintenance, repair and
liability of the Open Space, park or other public purpose area;
(4)   Common undeveloped Open Space or park land shall not be turned into a
commercial enterprise admitting the general public for a fee;
(5)   Homeowners in the development shall have adequate access to the Open
Space, park or other public purpose land.
      (6)   Any lands dedicated for Open Space, park or other public purpose in
a Subdivision shall be shown on the Final Plat.
   (c)   Maintenance by Owners' Association.  If an Owners' Association is
established for the ownership and maintenance of Open Space, the Owners'
Association Agreement must guarantee the continuing maintenance, repair and
liability for the Open Space. The Owners' Association shall be established
before any lot/parcel in the Subdivision is sold or any dwelling unit is
occupied. As each lot/parcel is sold, the purchaser must become a member of the
Owners' Association and this membership shall be written into the deed and run
with the land in perpetuity. The Owners' Association Agreement must be
submitted to the Planning Commission for review prior to or in conjunction with
submission of the Final Plat. The Owners' Association's covenants, restrictions
and bylaws, shall be filed with the Final Plat and recorded with the Fiscal
Office.
(1)   Specific Provisions in Owners' Agreement.  
A.   Owners' Association must be responsible and accept liability for
construction, repair and maintenance, including cost thereof, insurance and
taxes on Open Areas.
B.   Owners' Association must agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless all
governmental bodies for any and all claims of any kind that may arise related
to the Common Areas.
(2)   Draft Agreement must be submitted to the Planning Commission at the
Preliminary Plan stage.
   (d)    Maintenance of Open Space Areas. The owners of the Development
property as approved in Section
1106.04(a) above shall be responsible for maintenance, repair and liability of
all Open Space and park land. An Owners' Association may be established for the
purpose of permanently maintaining, repairing and being liable for all Open
Space and non-commercial recreation facilities. Such Owner Association
agreements, guaranteeing continuing maintenance, repair and liability shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for approval prior to the issuance of any
Subdivision Final Plat approvals. (See also Section
1106.04(e), Owners' Association).
   (e)    Owners' Association. An Owners' Association is a viable tool for
owning and maintaining various aspects of a Subdivision including but not
limited to, Common Areas and Open Space, private roads, sidewalks/walkways and
landscape elements (e.g. gateways, buffers,) Planned Residential Developments
with any private streets shall provide for the establishment of an Owners'
Association as part of Preliminary Plan and Final Plat approval.
(1)   Roles and Responsibilities. Dedicated Open Space created through the
Subdivision process shall remain undivided and may be owned and managed by an
Owners' Association. The Owners' Association shall be responsible and liable
for any and all construction, repair, replacement, maintenance, insurance,
taxes and costs of any kind or nature on Common Areas including but not limited
to: Open Space, recreation facilities, private roads and private community
water and sewer systems. The Owners' Association shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless all governmental bodies for any and all claims of any kind or
nature that may arise or are related to the Common Areas.
(2)    A preliminary document including bylaws shall be submitted by the
Developer at the Preliminary Plan Stage. If open space is owned and maintained
by a Home Owners' Association, the Developer shall file a declaration of
Covenants, Restrictions and bylaws that will govern the association, to be
submitted with the application for Preliminary Plan approval. The provisions
shall include but are not necessarily limited to the following. The Owners'
Association shall be established before any lot/parcel in the Subdivision is
sold or any dwelling unit is occupied. Once established, the Owners'
Association shall maintain and exercise control over Common Areas, Open Space
and facilities. As each lot/parcel is sold, the purchaser must become a member
of the Owners' Association and this membership shall be written into the deed
and run with the land in perpetuity. Owners' must pay a pro rate share of
required costs and any assessment levied by the Owners' Association can become
a lien on the property if not paid. These covenants and restrictions and
bylaws, shall be filed with the Final Plat and recorded with the Fiscal Office.

1106.05 PUBLIC FACILITIES, OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION.
   Public Facilities. When land in a Major Residential Subdivision has been
identified as the site for a public park, school or other public facility as
part of an adopted comprehensive land use, parks or facility master plan, the
Planning Commission shall have the option to require that the land be reserved
in the Final Plat if the public body charged with the responsibility for the
designated public use submits a written request to the Planning Commission for
reservation of the land. This request shall not duplicate a dedication
requirement of Section
1106.01. Land Reservations shall terminate and be null or void, if the reserved
land is not purchased by the end of a two year period and it shall revert in
ownership to the Developer. The two year reservation and purchase period shall
be specified on the recorded Final Plat.

Adopted 11-27-23.)
1106.07 LANDSCAPE PLAN.
   An overall Landscape Plan as approved by the local Township shall be
submitted for all Major Subdivisions for the Planning Commission to review. The
Landscape Plan shall be designed by a registered landscape architect. The
Landscape Plan shall identify existing and proposed trees, shrubs and ground
covers; natural features such as rock outcroppings and other landscaping
elements. Landscaping shall be provided at the entrance(s) to the Subdivision
and adjacent to the Subdivision streets inside or outside of the right-of-way
as determined by consultation with the Township and County Engineer. Where
existing plants and trees are to be retained, the Landscape Plan shall include
proposed methods of protecting them during construction. The character of the
landscape design shall be agreed upon at the Concept Plan Stage review meeting.
   (a)   Native Plants and Prohibited Species. All Landscape Plans should
incorporate at least thirty (30%) of native trees, shrubs and grasses into the
plant materials to provide habitat for local flora and fauna and reduce
irrigation needs. Landscape Plans shall not utilize species that are included
on the list of prohibited species found in
Appendix K.
   (b)   Low Impact Design. The use of low impact design and other innovative
measures to manage stormwater are encouraged. Certain measures can implement
the principles of low impact design including bioretention, rain gardens, rain
barrels, green roofs, permeable and porous pavements. The use of low impact
design measures are encouraged where appropriate because they are sustainable
measures that use natural hydrologic features to manage water.

following standards:
(1)   External light fixtures including pole or wall mounted, and parking lot
lighting shall be cut-off type fixtures of similar type and style.
(2)   All light fixtures chosen shall minimize glare and light trespass onto
adjacent properties.
(3)   Accent lighting of buildings or landscaping shall be permitted from
concealed cut-off type fixtures.
(4)   On site lighting standards shall be filed with the Final Plat.
   (b)   Commercial and Industrial Lighting. For commercial and industrial
Subdivisions, on-site lighting shall not trespass beyond property lines and
shall be so designed as to eliminate light pollution occurring off-site.
Lighting shall be classified into the following three types, all of which
should be incorporated into commercial and industrial sites: pedestrian
lighting; private parking lighting; and public street lighting.

CHAPTER 1107
Subdivision Standards for Planned Residential Developments
1107.01   General.
1107.02   Standards.
1107.03   Private streets.
1107.04   Sidewalks/walkways and pedestrian access.
1107.05   Staging of residential planned development.
1107.06   Open space and recreation facilities.
1107.07   Easements.
 
1107.01 GENERAL.
   Township Zoning approval of a Planned Residential Development does not
constitute either preliminary or final Subdivision approval.
   Planned Residential Developments, also known as Planned Unit Developments or
Conservation Developments are separate entities with a distinct character and
which are intended to be in harmony with surrounding developments. The project
must clearly demonstrate that natural features and substantial Open Space is
being preserved, that amenities are being provided which would enhance the
livability of the project and that can only be achieved as a Planned
Residential Development and such attributes of the project could not be
achieved with strict adherence to these Subdivision Regulations.
The purpose of a Planned Residential Development is to promote the following
goals:
   (a)    Minimize development on and destruction of sensitive natural resource
areas;
   (b)    Reduce the quantity and improve the quality of storm water runoff
from expected development;
   (c)    Maintain natural characteristics (such as woods, hedgerows, natural
vegetation, wetlands, meadows, slopes and streams);
   (d)    Reduce the amount of disturbed land, and the conversion of natural
areas to landscaped areas for lawns; and
   (e)    Maintain a traditional rural settlement pattern characterized by
compact groups of development in otherwise wide-open spaces.
      (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1107.02 STANDARDS.
   A major element of the Planned Residential Development is privately owned or
publicly owned Common areas and Open Space in the Development. Homeowners need
to have adequate access to the Common Open Space being preserved. These
developments usually contain such features as an internal park network abutting
home sites, recreation facilities, and preservation of natural amenities.
   Planned Residential Developments may be exempted from the conventional
development standards of these Subdivision Regulations only upon proper
justification and approval as set forth herein.
   The design of internal circulation systems shall be sensitive to such points
as safety, convenience, access to dwelling units and nonresidential facilities,
separation of vehicular and pedestrian-bicycle traffic, and general
attractiveness. Internal streets shall be adequate to carry anticipated traffic
and yet provide convenient and safe access in accordance with the standards set
forth herein.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1107.03 PRIVATE STREETS.
   Private local streets may be allowed in Planned Residential Developments
after review and approval by both the County Engineer and Planning Commission
and provided that the local Township Zoning Resolution provides for such
private streets. These private streets must meet the County approved
construction and inspection standards per Section
1107.03(a).
   Collector streets in Planned Residential Developments shall be publicly
dedicated streets and conform to the appropriate design standards. The Planning
Commission may also require certain streets within Planned Residential
Developments to be publicly dedicated if the Planning Commission determines
that the project density necessitates the use of public streets and that
traffic connections are required to adjacent plats or developments for adequate
traffic circulation.
   (a)    Planned Residential Development Private and Public Street Standards.
All public and private streets must comply with the County Engineer design and
pavement composition standards as well as the following requirements. The
construction of these streets will require inspection pursuant to Section
1110.07(c) and Performance and Maintenance Bonding pursuant to Section
1110.04. Private streets may be permitted in Planned Residential Developments
provided they meet the following requirements:
(1)   Loop or cul-de-sac streets in Planned Residential Developments that are
less than 250 feet in length and have ten (10) or fewer dwelling units
occupying the street will be permitted to be private. The design of these
streets shall provide for emergency vehicle access.
(2)   Access roads such as loop streets or cul-de-sacs within a Planned
Residential Development that are low volume traffic streets (Average Daily
Traffic of 200 vehicles or less) will be permitted to be private in accordance
with these Subdivision Regulations. The following standards also apply to
public streets.
A.   These public and private streets will be required to meet a 30-MPH design
speed, and 175 minimum foot centerline radius and in accordance with the County
Engineer Specs and Details.
B.   Centerline radii less than 175 feet may be approved for low volume loop
type streets or cul-de-sacs upon review and written approval by the County
Engineer.
C.   For roadways, drainage and utility easements, a fifty (50) foot dedicated
easement shall be granted to the Owners' Association. The purpose of the
easements should be stated on the Plat. If a public street, there must be fifty
(50) feet of dedicated right-of-way.
D.   A paved snow collection area adjacent to the private street and separate
from the residential unit driveways in the Planned Residential Development
shall be provided for storage of snow plowed from the roadway. The size of the
parking area shall be a minimum of 20% of the private roadway surface area.
(3)   Any street within a Planned Residential Development that has or is
projected to have an Average Daily Traffic exceeding 200 vehicles and is a
Light-Medium Traffic Local Road as classified in the County Engineer Specs and
Details, Table 1 may be permitted to be private in accordance with these
Subdivision Regulations. The area of the project devoted to streets and related
pavement should be the minimum necessary to provide adequate and safe movement
through the development. The following standards also apply to public streets.
A.   These roads will be required to meet a 30-MPH design speed, and 250- foot
centerline radius.
B.   A fifty (50) foot dedicated easement shall be granted to the Owners'
Association. If a public street, there must be fifty (50) feet of dedicated
right-of-way. The purpose of the easement should be stated on the plat.
         C.   Include twelve (12) foot utility easement outside of fifty (50)
feet.
   (b)   Private Street Requirements. In all cases where private streets are
permitted per these Subdivision Regulations an Owner's Association shall be
formed to control and maintain the streets as specified in Section
1106.04. Staff shall verify that submitted Owners' Association documents have
been properly filed with the appropriate government bodies and shall be
recorded on the Subdivision Plat. The approval of a private street does not
provide for or imply responsibility for construction, repair, replacement, or
maintenance, (including but not limited to: snow or ice removal, dust control,
drainage, mowing, tree trimming, etc.) of any private street by any government
body. All responsibility and liability remains with the Owners' Association and
owners of the lots served by the private street. Deed restrictions for private
streets are required to include the following language:
The undersigned grantee (s) hereby acknowledge (s) that (he, she) understand
that the premises described herein is located on a private non-dedicated
street. The Owners' Association is responsible or liable for the care, and
repair, replacement, snow or ice removal, dust control, drainage, mowing, tree
trimming, or maintenance of said private street. The Owners' Association for
such Development shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all governmental
bodies for any and all such claims of any kind or nature that may arise or be
related to the private street.
      (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16; Ord.
2023-339. Adopted 11-27-23.)
1107.04 SIDEWALKS/WALKWAYS AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS.
   A pedestrian circulation system should be designed to assure that
pedestrians can walk safely and easily on a site, between properties and
activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system.
   Sidewalks/walkways should connect with off road trails, which in turn should
link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with
existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable).
   The sidewalks/walkways shall be maintained by the Owners' Association, or
other maintenance arrangement approved by the Planning Commission, with input
from the local Township. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the
ADA and the County Engineer's Specs and Details. Deed restrictions for
sidewalks/walkways are required to include the following language:
No governmental body is responsible or liable for the care, repair, replacement
or maintenance of said sidewalks/walkways. The Owners' Association for such
Development shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all governmental bodies
for any and all such claims of any kind or nature that may arise or be related
to the sidewalks/ walkways.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1107.05 STAGING OF RESIDENTIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   Each stage of a Planned Residential Development must be so designed to stand
independently of future related stages in the event future stages are not
constructed. The construction and provision of all of the Common Open Spaces
and public and recreational facilities shown on the Final Plat must proceed at
the same rate as the construction of dwelling units.

1108.01 GENERAL PURPOSE.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, and location of all streets shall
conform to the Summit County General Land Use Development Plan. Proposed
streets and public access to adjacent unplatted lands shall be designed so that
the entire area can be served with a coordinated public street system. The
street system of a proposed Subdivision shall be designed to coordinate with
existing, proposed and planned streets outside of the Subdivision.
   All streets must be designed and constructed to the County Engineer Specs
and Details and comply with the Access Management Manual. The width of right-
of-way is to be provided so that all underground utilities can be located
outside of pavement areas.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1108.02 STREET PLANNING PRINCIPLES.
   (a)    Streets shall be designed so that building sites are at grades that
facilitate optimum drainage patterns.
   (b)    Street systems shall be designed to permit efficient drainage and
utility systems, and shall consist of only the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
   (c)    The use of curvilinear, U-shaped or loop streets and cul-de-sacs are
suitable in residential areas.
   (d)    All streets shall be properly related to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
   (e)    In commercial and industrial development, streets and other access
ways shall be planned to coordinate with the groups of buildings and the
location of rail facilities. Access ways, truck loading and maneuvering areas,
including walks and parking areas, shall be provided to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian and
bicycle. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the ADA and all
other applicable regulations.
   (f)    Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas
shall be planned to connect with arterial streets so as not to generate traffic
on residential streets. The intersection of parking lot driveways with arterial
or collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible
interference with traffic movement on those streets.
   (g)    In industrial subdivisions, streets shall be planned to serve
industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial or principal
collector streets so that no industrial traffic will be directed onto any
residential streets.
   (h)    There shall be a minimum separation of three hundred (300) feet
between intersections.
   (i)    Any oil or gas well and/or tank battery shall not encroach upon the
right-of-way of a proposed road.
   (j)   Road construction shall be in accordance with the County Engineer
Specs and Details.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1108.03 ACCESS LIMITATIONS.
   Where a Subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street the Planning Commission may require that access to such streets be
limited by means such as the following:
   (a)   Shared access points to the public right-of-way. (See, Figure 1)
   (b)    A series of U-shaped streets, short loops or cul-de-sacs entered from
and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear
lines of their terminal lots backing onto the principal arterial street.
   (c)    A marginal access or service road separated from the principal
arterial street by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at
suitable points.
   (d)    Dedicated access easements for future service road.
   (e)    The subdivision of land into lots so that they back onto the
principal arterial street and front onto a parallel local street. No access to
individual lots shall be provided from the principal arterial street, and a
safety buffer shall be provided in a strip along the rear property line of such
lots. (See, Figure 2)

1108.04 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   The Developer shall comply with the access management standards of the
Summit County Engineer as set forth in the County Engineer Specs and Details.
Access systems shall be properly designed so thoroughfares will be able to
accommodate the access needs of continued development while retaining their
primary transportation function. To achieve this policy intent, a Traffic
Impact Study will be required for Subdivisions which have access off County
roads. This study will evaluate the effect of Subdivision traffic with regard
to access management along the frontage of County Roads and adjacent
intersections and address what type of traffic improvements such as left turn
lanes, right turn lanes, traffic signals, acceleration and deceleration lanes
will be required. The County Engineer has the authority to waive the Traffic
Impact Study based upon the existing traffic volume and Subdivision size.
   The Traffic Impact Study shall be conducted in accordance with the standards
of the County Engineer as set forth in the County Engineer Specs and Details.

serving less than 25 sub-lots.
      (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16; Ord.
2023-339. Adopted 11-27-23.)
1108.06 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All construction pertaining to roads, drainage and underground utilities
shall conform with the latest edition of the "Access Management Manual," the
County Engineer Specs and Details and the Latest Edition of the "State of Ohio
Department of Transportation Construction and Material Specifications", except
as modified or otherwise specified herein.
   (a)   Local Streets. Local streets shall provide direct and full access to
each lot and shall be designed so that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged. The street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets
shall be in general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous
development of the entire neighborhood. The streets shall be extended to the
boundaries of the tract to be recorded unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the Subdivision with the development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets or
cul-de-sacs will be approved only when necessitated by topography or other
physical conditions or where they are appropriate for the type of development
contemplated. For fire and safety emergency access purposes each lot in a Major
Subdivision may be required to have two (2) means of access. The emergency
access issue will be reviewed at the Concept Plan Stage (See, Section
1103.07(b)) to determine a solution).
   (b)   Parallel Streets. Parallel Streets (e.g. access or service road) may
be required along an existing or proposed major arterial thoroughfare to
provide access to lots along such major arterial thoroughfares.
   These specifications and details, are for average soil conditions. Where in
the opinion of the County Engineer, soil conditions are below average, the
County Engineer may require the Developer to submit a soil study and
adjustments in design to conform with the conditions. Where in the opinion of
the Developer and/or the agent of the Developer, soil conditions are above
average, he may submit a soil study to the County Engineer for the
consideration of adjustments in design to conform with conditions.
   The County Engineer may also require adjustments in design to conform with
special conditions inherent within a particular subdivision, such as, but not
limited to wetlands, quicksand, springs, and landslides.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1108.07 GEOMETRIC DESIGN.
   The geometric design of roads in Subdivisions shall conform with the Access
Management Manual and the following:
   (a)    Sight Distance. All Subdivision roads and roads intersecting an
existing state, county and township roadway must have proper sight distance.
The requirements for sight distance are in the County Engineer Specs and
Details.
   (b)    Right-of-Way Widths. The minimum right-of-way width for all
Subdivisions shall be as shown in Table 1.
This minimum width shall be increased by easements where and to the extent the
County Engineer deems it necessary to conform with topographic, construction
and drainage features. The right-of-way shall be cleared of all obstructions
unless otherwise approved by the County Engineer.
   (c)    Pavement Width. The pavement width for each road class shall be as
shown in Table 1 and in the County Engineer Specs and Details.
   (d)    Location of Utilities Within a Dedicated Public Right-of-Way. All
main line utilities shall be located outside of the pavement structure to
insure the safety of the traveling public from hazards such as: settlement of
the trench from poor compaction, repairs to the main line, service connections
and general maintenance. When conflicts arise with other utilities, the
geometry of the proposed road, or other conditions; limited sections of
utilities will be considered for placement underneath the pavement structure.
The layout of these utilities will be reviewed on a case by case basis and must
be given approval prior to final design.
   (e)    Shoulders, Ditches and Slopes. The minimum requirements for
shoulders, ditches and slopes shall be as shown in the typical sections of the
County Engineer Specs and Details.
   (f)    Street Intersections. No more than four (4) road legs will be
permitted at any intersection. Road intersections shall be at ninety (90)
degrees where practical, but in no case less than seventy (70) degrees. Each
intersecting road shall have a tangent distance of at least one hundred (100)
feet for local roads or a curve with a minimum fourteen hundred (1,400) foot
radius, and two hundred (200) feet for collector roads or a curve with a
minimum of nineteen hundred (1,900) foot radius. Roads intersecting another
road from opposite sides shall be at least three hundred (300) feet apart,
measured between centerlines. The minimum radius of right-of- way lines and
pavement at intersection corners shall be twenty-five (25) feet. Drainage
should be directed away from the intersection as shown in Figure 401-2 of the
ODOT Location and Design Manual, Volume 1. Street jogs with centerline offsets
shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission and
County Engineer.
   (g)    Horizontal Alignment. At the Point of Intersection or tangent
Intersection, curves shall be installed having minimum radii as shown on Table
1.
   (h)    Vertical Alignments. Maximum and Minimum Grades for roads shall be as
shown on Table 1. The minimum grade for roadside ditches shall be greater than
or equal to 0.5%. Simple parabolic vertical curves shall be used to effect a
gradual change between tangent grades where the algebraic difference of grades
in percent is greater than 0.5%.
      (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1108.08 HALF STREETS.
   Half streets shall be prohibited except where there is an existing half
street adjacent to the Subdivision, in which case the remaining half of the
street shall be constructed and platted.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1108.09 BOULEVARDS AND ROADWAY ISLANDS.
   Boulevards and Roadway Islands shall meet Township approval. Refer to
Section
1108.11 with regard to ADA compliance. No portion of the Roadway Island shall
be located within county highway right of way.
(Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1108.10 CUL-DE-SAC AND DEAD-END STREETS.
   (a)    A residential street designed to be a permanent cul-de-sac, which
contains central water service and fire hydrants for its full length, may serve
up to twenty-five (25) lots; otherwise a permanent cul-de-sac shall not be
longer than one thousand (1,000) feet in residential areas. In commercial/

         (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)
1109.03 DRAINAGE DESIGN.
   Provisions shall be made to accommodate effectively the increased runoff
caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after completion of
the development. It may be necessary to direct surface water to a drainage
ditch, stream, or an existing storm system which has the capacity to carry the
flow. No natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings, nor
structures shall be placed in, on, or over it unless provision is made for the
flow of water in a manner satisfactory to the County Engineer.
   An easement shall be provided to the County Engineer on both sides of an
improved surface drainage course that was constructed during development for
the purpose of maintaining, and protecting, such stream for drainage and water
quality purposes. If the drainage facility is across private property then a
right-of-way or Easements must be obtained by the Developer in the name of the
County of Summit. These rights-of-way or Easements shall be shown on the Final
Plat and the Improvement Plans. A copy of the recorded easement shall be
furnished to the County Engineer.
   Storm sewer laterals will be provided as directed by the County Engineer for
each building on a street having curb and gutter. Rear drainage arrangements
shall be placed based upon the topography of the land.
   (a)   Drainage System Requirements.  The drainage system shall be designed
per the criteria of the County Engineer Stormwater Management Manual. To ensure
proper maintenance of the Stormwater Management System constructed by the
Developer, a Long-Term Maintenance Agreement requires a Maintenance Fee
obligation pass with the Title to the property. The Maintenance Fee to be
assessed is pursuant to O.R.C. Chapters 6131 and 6137 and is determined by the
County Engineer. A copy of the Maintenance Agreement Form that is to be
completed by the Developer and filed with the Plat is included in the County
Engineer Specs and Details.
   (b)   Road Drainage System. The road storm drainage system shall serve as
the local drainage system. It shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent
land, and house storm water drainage. To prevent excessive pipe sizes, storm
sewers shall drain into natural waterways as soon as possible.
   (c)   Storm Sewers, Manholes and Catch Basins.
(1)   Where curbs are installed, storm sewers with curb inlets will be required
in accordance with the Standard Drawings included in the County Engineer Specs
and Details.
(2)   Storm sewers or other approved means of erosion control shall be
installed in ditches or creeks running through subdivisions where water flow
velocity exceeds six (6) feet per second. Storm sewer manhole and inlet basin
spacing shall be approved by the County of Summit Engineer. See Pipe
Requirements, in County Engineer Specs and Details for approved material for
storm sewers. The minimum diameter of storm sewers shall be twelve (12) inches.
(3)   The installation of storm sewers, manholes, inlets and catch basins shall
conform with the construction in the County Engineer Specs and Details. All
storm sewers shall discharge into drainage courses shown on approved drainage
drawings or as approved by the County Engineer.
   (d)   Off-Road Drainage System. The design of the off-road drainage system
shall include the watershed affecting the allotment and shall be extended to a
watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
   (e)   Protection of Drainage Systems. The Developer shall adequately protect
all ditches (roadways and watercourses) to the satisfaction of the County
Engineer and Summit Soil and Water as shown by calculations made in accordance
with the policy of the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation and the
subdivision drainage criteria of the County Engineer and all other applicable
laws and regulations. In all cases, any drainage facilities within the
Subdivision shall be in a stable condition, free from either erosion or
sedimentation and/or other debris. Any damage resulting from erosion, scour,
silting of drainage ways, or blockage of storm drainage systems on and off the
development caused by the construction shall be corrected at the Developer's
expense.
   (f)   Drainage Outlets. All Subdivisions shall have an adequate outlet for
storm water. Where the County Engineer finds it necessary to clean, alter, or
reconstruct a natural drainage course or storm sewer system outside the
development boundary to provide a storm water outlet or to prevent damage to
other properties due to an increased runoff, the outlet shall be improved at
the expense of the Developer and in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by the County Engineer. When it is determined than an adequate outlet
does not exist, the Developer shall be required to provide a drainage system to
convey runoff from the development area to an approved drainage system.
   (g)   Drainage Drawings. The Developer's Engineer shall make a complete
study of the drainage area contributing to the Subdivision. The Developer will
then prepare a plan of the entire Subdivision showing the following:
(1)   Existing and proposed contours at two (2) foot intervals.
(2)   Proposed streets and lots.
(3)   Proposed drainage system showing the area contributing to each pipe or
drainage structure.
The Developer's Engineer shall submit copies of all data and calculations
sheets to the County Engineer for review and approval.

Appendix E. It must be submitted not less than twenty (20) days prior to a
regularly scheduled Planning Commission Meeting. Each request for a variance
shall be on a separate application form. The variance request application form
shall be completed in its entirety and shall include the specific section from
which a variance is being sought and the specific reason (s) for a variance.
Staff may return an incomplete application form pertaining to a notice of an
appeal for a variance to the Applicant and request additional information as
required.
(2)   The Applicant shall provide the following information with the variance
application form.
A.   The specific section of the Subdivision Regulations shall be cited from
which a variance is requested.
B.   Written justification for a variance shall address the following factors:
1.    Whether the variance is substantial.
2.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be altered or
whether adjoining properties would be adversely affected as a result of the
variance.
3.   Whether exceptional topographic or other physical conditions exist which
are peculiar to the particular parcel of land.
4.   Whether the peculiar conditions specified in subparagraph number 3 did or
did not result from previous actions by the Applicant.
5.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental
services.
6.   Whether the Subdivision Regulation was in effect at the time of
acquisition of the property by the applicant and whether the Applicant
purchased the property with the knowledge of these Subdivision Regulations.
7.   Whether the Applicant's predicament can be obviated through some method
other than a variance.
8.   Why the variance from the terms of these Subdivision Regulations will not
be contrary to the public interest.
9.   Describe the special conditions that will cause an unnecessary hardship
result from a literal enforcement of these Subdivision Regulations.
10.   Show how the spirit and intent behind these Subdivision Regulations will
be observed if the variance is granted.
11.   That the requested variance is the minimum variance to these Subdivision
Regulations that will allow for a reasonable division of land.
   (b)    Other Conditions. In evaluating a variance request, the Planning
Commission may consider the opinion of Township officials and require other
conditions to be met to accomplish the purposes of these Subdivision
Regulations in order to grant such variance without unduly affecting the public
safety.
(1)   Cul-de-sac Length. If the proposed variance involves the establishment of
a cul-de-sac in excess of the maximum permitted length, the Planning Commission
may also consider the number and size of lots served by the cul-de-sac and the
availability of central water service to determine if the variance will permit
appropriate development of the land without unduly affecting the public safety.
(2)   Lot Width. If the proposed variance involves the creation of a lot whose
depth exceeds four and one-half (4½) times its width, the Planning Commission
may also consider the pattern of existing platting for similarly zoned land in
the vicinity.
(3)   County Council. The County Council may grant variances affecting required
improvements upon recommendation of the Planning Commission. Such
recommendations shall be based on the findings listed above in Section
1111.06.
   (c)   Expiration of Variance Approval. Any variance (s) granted by the
Planning Commission from these Subdivision Regulations in conjunction with an
approved Preliminary Plan runs with the Preliminary Plan Approval. Any such
variance (s) shall expire when the approved Preliminary Plan expires.
      (Res. 2008-026. Adopted 3-17-08; Ord. 2015-561. Adopted 1-25-16.)

where there is actual and immediate risk of failure or collapse of a structure

1345.03   Administration.
1345.04   Use and development standards for flood hazard reduction.
1345.05   Appeals and variances.
1345.06   Enforcement.
 
1345.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Statutory Authorization.  This resolution is adopted pursuant to
authorization contained in Sections 307.37 and 307.85 of the Ohio Revised Code.
This resolution adopts regulations for areas of special flood hazard that are
necessary for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (b)    Findings of Fact.  The County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas) has
special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)    Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)    Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the County of
Summit (Unincorporated Areas) as identified in Section 1345.01 (f), including
any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the County of Summit
(Unincorporated Areas).
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)    Flood Insurance Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective April 19, 2016.
      (2)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas) as required by Section
1345.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Department of Building Standards.
   (g)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing resolutions including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other resolution, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)    Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas), any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)    Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations
be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part
thereof, other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2024-047. Adopted 3-4-24.)
1345.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure
A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and
subordinate to, the principal structure.
Appeal
A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any
provision of these regulations or a request for a variance.

one hundred (100) year flood.
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum,
usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American
Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In
Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade
elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3 feet).
Basement

sides.
Development
Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor
See “Lowest Floor.”
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
    (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
Zone A99: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
the County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas)’s historic preservation program,
which program is certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction,
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the lowest floor” which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code, as amended.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park
means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by Summit County
(Unincorporated Areas) and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
“start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [April 15, 1981] or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Rev. Code §111.15(A)(2) as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or any
court.
Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less
when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-
propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio
Rev. Code §4703.01 and 4703.19.
Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A-130,
or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone
and designated from other federal state or local sources of data including but
not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks,
previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the ‘before damaged’ condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This
term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless
of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.
(Ord. 2024-047. Adopted 3-4-24.)

completed by a registered professional engineer or architect together with
associated documentation.
   (h)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit. A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Appeals Board in accordance with Section
1345.05 of these regulations.
   (i)    Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.  An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for maintenance work such
as roofing, painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural
development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than
$2500.
   (j)    State and Federal Development.
      (1)    Development that is funded, financed, undertaken, or preempted by
state agencies shall comply with minimum NFIP criteria.
      (2)    Before awarding funding or financing or granting a license,
permit, or other authorization for a development that is or is to be located
within a 100-year floodplain, a state agency shall require the applicant to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the agency that the development will comply
with minimum NFIP criteria and any applicable local floodplain management
resolution or ordinance as required by Ohio Revised Code Section 1521.13. This
includes, but is not limited to:
         A.    Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured
home park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Commerce and
subject to the flood damage reduction provisions of the Ohio Administrative
Code Section 4781-12.
         B.    Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting
Board under Section 4906 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         C.    Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous
Waste Siting Board under Section 3734 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (3)    Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which
are subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 – Floodplain Management.
         1.    Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)    Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Summit County’s flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1305.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)    Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.    For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.    Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.    Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
            3.    Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.    Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1345.04 (c).
         B.    It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with Section
1345.03 (k)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.    The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.    Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.    Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.    Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1345.03(k)(1)1.
      (2)    Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the County Executive of
the County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas) and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)    Annexation / Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas) have been modified by annexation or the
community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In
order that Summit County (Unincorporated Areas)’s Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas) boundaries,
include within such notification a copy of a map of the County of Summit
(Unincorporated Areas) suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the County of Summit (Unincorporated
Areas) has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)    Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)    In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1345.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)    Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)    Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data
      (1)    Zone A:
         A.    Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.    When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)    Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
         A.    BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.    Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.    Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.    If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1345.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)    Zones B, C, and X:
         A.    Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO. Communities are
encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that
the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)    Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)    Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)    Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)    Development in Floodways.
         A.    In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.    Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base
flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by
the applicant:
            1.    Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1345.03(k)(1);
            2.    An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.    Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.    Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.    Concurrence of the County Executive of the County of Summit
(Unincorporated Areas) and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities
impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)    Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.    In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.    Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.    An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.    Section
1345.04(i)(1)B, items (1) and (3)-(5).
      (3)    Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.    Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
County of Summit (Unincorporated Areas) specifying the maintenance
responsibilities. If an agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of
the floodplain development permit.
         D.    The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1345.03(k)(1)3 when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2024-047. Adopted 3-4-24.)
1345.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)    Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The County of Summit Board of Building Appeals is hereby appointed
to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Chapter
1327.
      (2)    Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the
Department of Building Standards.
   (b)    Powers and Duties.
      (1)    The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
these regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1345.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)    Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 15 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)    Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)    Application for a Variance.
         A.    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.    All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the County of
Summit (Unincorporated Areas).
      (2)    Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)    Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
            Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)    Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing items in Section
1345.05(d)(3) A-K have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
onehalf acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
