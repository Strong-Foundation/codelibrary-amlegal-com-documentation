EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self- identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 147.02 indicates that the code number is 1, the chapter number is 147
(or the 47th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 311.01 indicates that the code number is 3,
the chapter number is 311 (or the 11th chapter within code 3), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially odd-numbered, thus
reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 759.061, 759.062 and 759.063
follow 759.06 and precede 759.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections.
   Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material contained within a given chapter.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the 1971 Codified Ordinances of Parma
Heights was either ordinances or resolutions previously enacted by City
Council, or new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the 1971
Codified Ordinances without any history indicate that such sections contain new
matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the following table, the
disposition of all source material in the 1971 Parma Heights Codified

of the Council member's ward equal to twenty percent (20%) in number of the
electors of such ward who voted at the last preceding municipal election.
   Within ten (10) days after filing such petition, the Council shall determine
the sufficiency thereof. If the Council shall find the petition insufficient,
it shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is defective,
and deliver a copy of its certificate to the person who filed the petition with
it, and such person shall be allowed a period of twenty (20) days after the day
on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition sufficient.
   If the Council shall find the petition sufficient, it shall promptly so
certify to the officer whose removal is sought, and if the officer does not
resign within five (5) days thereafter, the Council shall thereupon fix a day
for holding a recall election, not less than thirty (30) days nor more than
forty (40) days from the date of the certificate of sufficiency. At such recall
election the question shall be placed on the ballot "Shall (naming the officer)
be allowed to continue as (naming the office) ?" with the provision on the
ballot for voting affirmatively and negatively on such question. If a majority
of the votes cast at such election shall be voted affirmatively such officer
shall remain in office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted
negatively such officer shall be considered as removed and such office shall be
declared vacant.
   Such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer
removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the
vacancy created by such recall election.

CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

CHAPTER 111
City-Issued Credit/Purchasing Card Policy
111.01   Purpose.
111.02   General guidelines.
111.03   Finance Director responsibilities.
111.04   Overseeing appropriate use of the card.
111.05   Ensuring documentation requirements are met.
111.06   Rules and procedures for use.
111.07   Documentation requirements.
111.08   Preventing fraud.
111.09   Unauthorized purchases.
111.10   Inappropriate use of cards.
111.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this policy it to ensure that City issued credit cards and/or
purchase cards (such as Home Depot, VISA, Mastercard, Discover) are closely
monitored to provide for maximum security and to guard against misuse and/or
losses for which the City may be held liable. This policy is meant to comply
with the mandates of Sub HB 312 enacted by the 132nd General Assembly. City use
includes cases where a purchase order is not accepted for needed services,
supplies and/or materials, or are purchased from a vendor who issues a purchase
card to be used in conjunction with a purchase order. The City-issued cards are
NOT for personal use, and will not be permitted to be carried by personnel on a
regular basis for any reason. All City credit cards shall be issued in the name
of the "City of Parma Heights, Ohio"; or issued jointly in an individual City
employee name and "City of Parma Heights", as may be required by the credit
card issuing agency.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 2-11-19.)
111.02   GENERAL GUIDELINES.
   (a)   City credit cards and/or purchase cards are to be kept in the control
of the Director of Finance or his/her designee, who will secure the cards in a
safe, or in a locked cash box in a secure office.
   (b)   The Director of Finance shall keep a master list of all employees who
are permitted to use City credit cards, along with each employee's title, and a
master list of cards (and the names that appear on each card, if applicable)
within the department. A copy of both master lists must be on file with the
Finance Department and must remain current. All City employees authorized to
use a City credit card and/or purchase card must sign the Credit/Purchasing
Card Policy acknowledging statement.
   (c)   A log of the card name showing date, sign out time, sign in time,
signature of person using the card, and valid purchase order number is to be
kept by the Finance Director or designee. The Director of Finance, or designee
must initial each entry on the log indicating approval of the card's use and
the purchase. Anyone needing to use a card must go to the Director of Finance,
or designee holding the card and sign the card in and out on this log.
   (d)   Regular purchase order policy and procedures must be followed whenever
you anticipate using the card. Every purchase using any card must have a valid
purchase order assigned to it before the purchase is legal. The purchase order
must contain the vendor and provide descriptions, account numbers and estimated
dollar amounts. No purchase shall exceed a spending limit of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) without the express written consent of the Director of
Finance or designee. This will assure that sufficient appropriations exist to
cover the anticipated charges. Once an invoice is received, simply return a
copy of the P.O. along with the receipts you have accumulated, directly to the
Finance Department, to complete the transaction.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 2-11-19.)
111.03   FINANCE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (a)   Determining Who Should Receive a Card. The Finance Director or
designee should review, approve, and determine when a credit card account will
be opened. Cards may be signed out to City employees only.
   (b)   Retrieving Cards from Employees. The credit and/or purchase card must
be returned to the Finance Director at the conclusion of the purchase; and no
later than the close of business on the day the card is signed out; unless
prior arrangements are made with the Finance Director or designee.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 2-11-19.)
111.04   OVERSEEING APPROPRIATE USE OF THE CARD.
   The Finance Director or designees will review all credit card transaction
and management reports to ensure that the cards are being used appropriately.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 2-11-19.)
111.05   ENSURING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.
   The Finance Director or designees will:
   (a)   Ensure necessary detail and documentation are provided on all
transactions.
   (b)   Ensure that itemized receipts and card statements are retained and
kept in accordance with the City's Records Retention Schedule.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 2-11-19.)
111.06   RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR USE.

personal purchases.
   (b)   The card may only be used by the City employee having signed out the
card.
   (c)   Itemized receipts must be obtained for all transactions.
   (d)   Pyramiding - i.e., dividing one purchase into two or more, in order to
stay within your transaction limit - is not allowed.
   (e)   City credit/purchasing cards may not be used to receive cash advances.
   (f)   Personnel using City credit/purchasing cards are responsible for
resolving discrepancies and ensuring credits are received.
   (g)   Personnel using City credit/purchasing cards may not receive cash back
or in-store credits for any refunds or exchanges. Such amounts must be credited
to the credit card account. If a supplier mistakenly issues a refund check, it
must be submitted to the Budget and Finance Department within five days of
receipt by the cardholder.
   (h)   Cardholders should not pay Ohio sales tax. The cardholder must tell
in-State suppliers the City is exempt from Ohio sales tax. A copy of the City's
Tax Exempt Certificate is available if the supplier needs to see it.
   (i)   If grant funds are being charged, City credit/purchasing card users
are responsible for seeing that all granting agency requirements are fulfilled.
   (j)   Personnel using City credit/purchasing cards may not make purchases
that violate City policy restricting business transactions that may be
perceived as a conflict of interest (purchases from a business in which you or
a relative have a financial interest).
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 2-11-19.)
111.07   DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Employees should always obtain an itemized receipt for each
transaction. If a cash register tape does not have descriptions, write them on
the tape. Any transaction without a properly substantiated receipt is subject
to reimbursement of the City by the employee.
   (b)   A receipt is defined as an invoice, cash register receipt, sales slip,
or packing slip which contains an itemized list of goods purchased, with dollar
amounts, and the name and location of the supplier. An employee of the supplier
must sign handwritten receipts.
      (1)   Purchases made in person. Retain the itemized receipt in addition
to the credit card copy to properly substantiate the purchase.
      (2)   Faxed or mailed purchases. Retain a copy of the order as faxed or
mailed and the fax confirmation (if available) for your records.

   (c)   The user must immediately advise the Finance Director if a card is
damaged, lost, stolen or the subject of suspected fraudulent activity.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 2-11-19.)
111.08   PREVENTING FRAUD.
   Personnel using City credit/purchasing cards should use basic security
measures, as outlined below, to guard against fraud:
   (a)   DO keep the card in a secure location; guard the card number
carefully.
   (b)   DO save receipts and statements in a secure area (they may contain
your card number).
   (c)   DO keep an eye on the card during the transaction, and retrieve it as
soon as possible.
   (d)   DO always know where the City credit/purchasing card is. If you can't
find the card, assume the worst: Notify the Director of Finance so that the
account can be canceled.
   (e)   DO be aware of what you are signing: Your signature can copy through
to other slips deliberately placed underneath.
   (f)   DO audit your monthly statement closely. Make sure all charges shown
are legitimate charges.
   (g)   DO visit reputable, familiar merchants whenever possible.
   (h)   DO report possible fraud immediately.
   (i)   DO NOT discard credit card slips in public areas, or discard them
whole. Thieves can acquire your card number from receipts, slips and
statements.
   (j)   DO NOT lend the City credit/purchasing card to anyone; including
another City employee.
   (k)   DO NOT give your card number to anyone over the phone unless you know
you are dealing with a reputable vendor.

card. If inappropriate use of the card is discovered, disciplinary action up to
and including discharge from employment is possible. In the event of fraudulent
use, the City may pursue legal prosecution.

employee's attending physician's prognosis as to the employee's ability to
return to employment. Once an employee has returned to assume normal duties,
following absence due to a service-connected injury, subsequent absences,
alleged as being due to the service-connected injury, will be charged against
the employee's accumulated sick leave, unless excused by the employee's
attending physician's certificate.
      (3)   At the time of retirement from active duty with the City or death
of the employee, the employee, or the employee's estate, will be paid in cash
for sixty percent of the value of his or her accrued, but unused, sick leave
credit. Such payment shall be based on the employee's rate of pay at time of
retirement or death. Payment for sick leave on this basis shall be considered
to eliminate all sick leave credit accrued by the employee at that time. Such
payment shall be made only once to any employee. The maximum payment which may
be made shall be sixty percent of 1,200 hours for employees working eight-hour
days and sixty percent of 1,050 hours for employees working seven-hour days.
The formula for computation shall be:
         A.   In the case of employees working eight-hour days: Annual salary +
annual longevity (if applicable) divided by annual regular hours x .60 (up to
1,200 hours).
         B.   In the case of employees working seven-hour days: Annual salary +
annual longevity (if applicable) divided by annual regular hours x .60 (up to
1,050 hours).
         NOTE: Annual rate of pay used in above unused sick time payment
calculations is based on the total of the base salary and longevity pay only.

within the same pay period with supervisor approval, then for overtime hours in

191.03   ADMISSIONS EXEMPT FROM TAX.
   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any admission all
the proceeds of which inure:
   (a)   Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies or organizations, if no part of the net earnings
thereof inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual;
   (b)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State and if no part of their net

   (c)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons who serve in the military or
naval forces of the United States and are in need;
   (d)   Exclusively to the benefit of members of the Departments of Police and

or
   (e)   Exclusively to the benefit of any fund of the City, the proceeds from

   The exemption from tax provided by this section shall, however, not be
allowed in cases of admission to wrestling matches, prize fights, boxing,
sparring or other pugilistic matches or exhibitions, nor in the case of
admissions to any athletic game or exhibition the proceeds of which inure
wholly or partly to the benefit of any high school, academy, preparatory or
other school, in cases wherein the admission price is forty-one cents (41£) or
more, or wholly or partly to the benefit of any college or university.
   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from admissions tax has
been allowed, the treasurer of the institution, society or organization for
whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Director of Finance, setting forth the amount of money actually received by
such treasurer, together with the expense of promoting and conducting such
event. Such statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for
exemption from admissions tax for the benefit of such institution, society or
organization. If such statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for
promoting and conducting such event in relation to the profits, if any, no such
exemption shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed to any
institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis, if such percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.
(Ord. 1960-95. Passed 11-28-60.)
191.04   COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect it until paid to
the Director of Finance as herein provided. Any person required to collect the
tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect it or, having collected it,
fails to remit it to the Director in the manner prescribed by this chapter,
whether such failure is the result of his own act or the result of acts or
conditions beyond his control, shall nevertheless be personally liable to the
City for the amount of such tax and shall, unless the remittance is made as
herein required, be guilty of a violation of this chapter.
   The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Director in
monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the tenth day of the
month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received.
   Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check, unless
payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Director. Payment by check
shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability for payment and
remittance of the tax to the Director unless the check is honored and is in the
full and correct amount. The person receiving any payment for admissions shall
make out a return upon such forms and setting forth such information as the
Director may require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which
he is liable for the preceding monthly period. He shall sign and transmit the
form to the Director with a remittance for such amount. The Director may, in
his discretion, require verified annual returns from any person receiving
admission payments, setting forth such additional information as he may deem
necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement
makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the
same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Director shall be the
judge, the Director may require the report and remittance of the admission tax
immediately upon the collection of the tax, at the conclusion of the
performance or exhibition or at such other times as the Director shall
determine.
   Failure to comply with any requirement of the Director as to report and
remittance of the tax as required herein shall be a violation of this chapter.
The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied
shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be subject to examination
and audit by the Director at all reasonable times. If the tax imposed by this
chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added as part of the tax a penalty
of ten percent per month or fraction thereof from the time the tax became due
until paid.
(Ord. 1982-30. Passed 6-14-82.)
191.05   CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Director of
Finance, make application to and procure from the Director a Certificate of
Registration, the fee for which shall be one dollar ($1.00), which Certificate
shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which it is issued. Such
Certificate of Registration, or duplicate original copies thereof to be issued
by the Director without additional charge, shall be posted in a conspicuous
place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold.
(Ord. 1960-95. Passed 11-28-60.)
191.06   CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a Certificate of Registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lot or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section 191. 04
by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting the
place. The applicant for a Certificate of Registration for such purpose shall
furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner, lessee
or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be conducted. Such
owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Director of Finance of the
issuance of such Certificate and the joint liability for collection and
remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 1960-95. Passed 11-28-60.)
191.07   RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Director of Finance shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing
the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A copy of such
rules and regulations shall be posted in the manner provided by ordinance at
least once before they become effective and copies shall be made available in
the office of the Director. Failure or refusal to comply with any such rules
and regulations shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.

relating to admission taxes in effect on August 31, 1947, except as the same

competent jurisdiction. However, the Director may furnish the Bureau of
Internal Revenue, Treasury Department of the United States, with copies of
returns filed.
(Ord. 1960-95. Passed 11-28-60.)

   In the taxation of income which is subject to City income taxes if the books
and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within and
without the boundaries of the City, shall disclose with reasonable accuracy
what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable sites in the City for the purposes of
municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the City, in the absence of
actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business apportionment percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
   (a)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated;
   As used in the preceding division, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
   (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed;
   (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
(Ord. 1966-104. Passed 12-30-66; Ord. 2004-36. Passed 12-13-04.)

goods within the City;
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion;
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where title

the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.

   (a)   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with divisions
(a), (b) and (c) of Section
193.24 or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the particular
taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of percentages used in
deriving such total in order to obtain the business apportionment percentage
referred to in Section
193.24.
   (b)   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned entirely in
or outside the City.

193.27   RENTALS.
   (a)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under divisions (c), (d)
and (e) of Section

operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
   (b)   Residents are required to file and report the status of all property
located within and without the City. Nonresidents are required to file and
report the status of all property within the City whether or not income is
received. When the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties
aggregates in excess of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month,
the net income shall be subject to tax. City residents owning rental property
located outside of the City are required to file the net profit or loss with
the City and pay any tax due. In the case of commercial property, the owner
shall be considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on
a fixed or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of
the lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the
owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he or she shares
in crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net
receipts derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds such
one hundred twenty- five dollars ($125.00) per month; and provided further that
the person who operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in
business whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month.

following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.

entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the

close of each calendar quarter, make a return and pay to the Administrator the
amount of taxes so deducted, subject to divisions (c), (d) and (e) of this
section. Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to
the Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of

who is charged with the responsibility of filing the return, including the
power of making the payment, shall be personally liable for the failure to file
the return and pay the tax due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy
or reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability, for a prior failure of such business, to file a return
and pay taxes due. An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
   (b)   Such employer, in collecting such tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his or
her employees, shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust
fund in the hands of such employer.

dollars ($250.00) or more in the first or second month of a calendar quarter
shall, on or before the twentieth day of the following month, pay to the
Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted.
   (d)   Such employer who makes such payments on a monthly basis for the first
two months of a calendar quarter shall pay such tax deducted for the third
month of a calendar quarter at the regular time for filing the employer's
quarterly return of income tax withheld.
   (e)   Such payments shall be on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable
upon request from the Administrator, setting forth the amount of tax deducted
for the month.
   (f)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person's residence, even though such residence is in the City, but
such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.

on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This

nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (c)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
taxable income" as defined in Section

taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to Parma
Heights for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
194.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and

involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;

shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section

affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer

the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in

the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

owned by the individual, shall be subject to Parma Heights' tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Parma Heights or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Parma

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of Parma Heights shall report the

reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or

than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:

periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division g(1)D.1. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee’s or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (f) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (f)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (f)(2):
         A.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)A. of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)B. of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)C. of this section, and
notwithstanding division (f)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (f)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 194.04 of this chapter.

withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Parma Heights in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of
Parma Heights in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00).
               Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         C.   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (b)(l)A. and B. of
this section, taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of Parma Heights in the
preceding calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
dollars ($11,999), or if in any month of the preceding calendar year exceeded
one thousand dollars ($1,000). Payment under division (b)(1)C. of this section
shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not
later than one of the following:
            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;

deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of the month.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment and subsequent payments, based on the Tax Administrator's
determination, may be required to be made by electronic funds transfer to the
Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Parma
Heights. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division
does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any
return as required under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Parma Heights as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Parma Heights income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Parma Heights the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to Parma
Heights income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Parma Heights until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Parma Heights during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Parma Heights
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an

this section, an employer is not required to withhold Parma Heights income tax
on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services in Parma Heights if the employee performed such services in Parma

conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in Parma

"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in Parma Heights at which the employer provides or provided services
that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last
more than twenty days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected

applies at the time the services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty days.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in Parma
Heights only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in Parma Heights than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Parma Heights exceeds the twenty day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to Parma Heights for any subsequent days
in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in Parma Heights.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Parma Heights
under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for Parma
Heights for the first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in Parma Heights.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Parma Heights and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
194.02, the employer shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to Parma
Heights, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of Parma Heights.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to

the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the

            A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

extended due date of Parma Heights’ income tax return for a taxpayer that is

unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Parma Heights' income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month

municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (g)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (g)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has

required to receive the extension under division (g)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (g)(2)B. of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this

payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
194.04(b)(1)A. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for Parma Heights by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section

remitted to Parma Heights and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by Parma Heights to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Parma Heights, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Parma
Heights or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this

otherwise due to Parma Heights before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by Parma Heights in accordance with

taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of

   (s)   (l)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Parma Heights'
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated Municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated Municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated Municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(l) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(l) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
Municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Parma Heights income tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Parma Heights. A taxpayer that is required to file
a consolidated Parma Heights income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Parma Heights income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Parma Heights income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (l)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated Municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
194.02, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Parma Heights income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
194.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Parma Heights income tax return shall do
one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or
loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Parma Heights. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Parma Heights. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Parma Heights;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Parma Heights income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Parma Heights income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this
section by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Parma Heights income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by Parma Heights in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Parma Heights before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Parma Heights may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed 100 percent of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other municipality by the tax rate in such other municipality or the rate of
two percent, whichever is lower.
   (b)   Parma Heights shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of Parma Heights who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax
in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing
the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.
(Ord. 2015-52. Passed 12-14-15.)
194.07   ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for Parma Heights from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to Parma Heights in equal amounts on each payment date
unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve

194.05(g) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Parma Heights,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;

month of the following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for
the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the

194.05.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
194.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with Parma
Heights under Section
194.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Parma Heights but was
not domiciled here on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

194.09   REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
194.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by Parma Heights:

   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the

      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
194.18(a)(4).

have been deposited with Parma Heights is subject to recovery by Parma Heights.

Heights shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Parma
Heights claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If Parma Heights' tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Parma
Heights' tax rate. However, if Parma Heights' tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Parma Heights, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-52. Passed 12-14-15.)
194.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Parma Heights changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with Parma
Heights. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal

consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or

prosecutions under Section
194.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by Parma Heights. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
194.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.

State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Parma Heights' tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Parma Heights return showing income

Heights income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Parma Heights does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Appeals, of the Ohio
Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of
Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than
the amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as

194.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
194.09(e).
   (e)   No civil or criminal action to recover Parma Heights income tax or

alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.

this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by

      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able

certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the assessment's
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Parma Heights official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local Board of Tax Appeals within sixty days after
the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
            "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Parma Heights
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Appeals.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-52. Passed 12-14-15.)
194.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Parma Heights that arises pursuant to Parma Heights's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of Parma
Heights:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-52. Passed 12-14-15.)
194.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Parma Heights as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit Parma Heights from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-52. Passed 12-14-15.)
194.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Parma Heights' ordinance or State
law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to

Parma Heights to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

194.19   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR AND FINANCE DIRECTOR; VERIFICATION OF

   Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and Federal and State income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         B.   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under Parma Heights'
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

respective official duties as provided by law;

other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator and Finance Director shall

applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by Parma Heights or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

books, papers, records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this
section shall fail to comply.

number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
194.99 for a violation of Section
194.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
         D.   In the case of residents, it is incumbent upon the taxpayer to

subject to appeal.

before the Board of Tax Appeals and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Appeals
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Appeals may affirm, reverse, or modify the Finance
Director assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax Appeals
shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety days after the
Board of Tax Appeals' final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within
fifteen days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Finance

rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Ohio R.C.

(ORC 4513.361)
303.08   IMPOUNDING OF VEHICLES; REDEMPTION.
   (a)   Police officers are authorized to provide for the removal and
impounding of a vehicle under the following circumstances:
      (1)   When any vehicle is left unattended upon any street, bridge or
causeway and is so illegally parked so as to constitute a hazard or obstruction
to the normal movement of traffic, or so as to unreasonably interfere with
street cleaning or snow removal operations;
      (2)   When any motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, is left on private residential property, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.60, or on private agricultural property, for at least
four consecutive hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property, or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way
of any road or highway, for 48 consecutive hours or longer, without
notification to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving such vehicle in
such place, except that when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to
traffic, it may be ordered into storage immediately;
      (3)   When any vehicle has been stolen or operated without the consent of
the owner;
      (4)   When any vehicle displays illegal license plates or fails to
display the current lawfully required license plates;
      (5)   When any vehicle has been used in or connected with the commission
of a felony;
      (6)   When any vehicle has been damaged or wrecked so as to be inoperable
or violates equipment provisions of this Traffic Code whereby its continued
operation would constitute a condition hazardous to life, limb or property;
      (7)   When any vehicle is left unattended due to the removal of an ill,
injured or arrested operator;
      (8)   When any vehicle has been operated by any person who has failed to
stop in case of an accident or collision;
      (9)   When any vehicle has been operated by any person who is driving
without a lawful license or while his or her license has been suspended or

      (10)   When any vehicle is found for which two or more citation tags for
violations of this Traffic Code have been issued and the owner or operator
thereof has failed to respond to such citation tags as lawfully required.
   (b)   Any vehicle removed under authority of division (a)(2) of this section
shall be ordered into storage and/or disposed of as provided under Ohio R.C.
4513.60 et seq. Any other vehicle removed under authority of this section shall
be ordered into storage and the Police Department shall forthwith notify the
registered vehicle owner of the fact of such removal and impounding, reasons
therefor and the place of storage. Any person desiring to redeem an impounded
vehicle shall appear at the Police Department to furnish satisfactory evidence
of identity and ownership or right to possession. Prior to issuance of a
release form, the claimant, owner or operator shall either pay the amount due
for any fines for violations on account of which such vehicle was impounded or,
as the court may require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear
to answer to such violations. The pound operator shall release such vehicle
upon the receipt of the release form and payment of all towage and storage
charges.
   (c)   No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the place
of storage without complying with the above procedure. Possession of a vehicle
which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the place of storage, by the
owner or operator, shall constitute prima facie evidence that it was so removed
by the owner or operator.
303.09   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief's territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief's or trooper's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief's records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing
of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10   REMOVAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (a)   No person shall leave an abandoned vehicle standing or parked on
private property for seven days or more unless such vehicle is stored in the
garage located on the owner's, lessee's or agent's premises. It shall be prima
facie evidence of abandonment if any of the following circumstances exist:
      (1)   The vehicle fails to display the current lawfully required license
plates.
      (2)   The vehicle has been damaged or wrecked so as to be inoperable.
      (3)   The vehicle violates equipment provisions of this Traffic Code.
      (4)   The vehicle is apparently inoperable.
   (b)   The director of public safety shall cause a written notice to be
served upon the owner, lessee or agent of the premises requiring an abandoned
vehicle to be removed from the premises within 72 hours after service of
notice.
   (c)   No person shall fail to remove the vehicle within 72 hours after
service of notice.

penalty is otherwise provided is guilty of one of the following:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree;
         B.   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this Traffic Code, a
misdemeanor of the third degree;
         C.   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this Traffic
Code, a misdemeanor of the second degree.
      (2)   When any person is found guilty of a first offense for a violation
of Section
333.03, upon a finding that the person operated a motor vehicle faster than 35
miles an hour in a business district of the Municipality, or faster than 50
miles an hour in other parts of the Municipality, or faster than 35 miles an
   hour while passing through a school zone during recess or while children are
going to or leaving school during the opening or closing hours, the person is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
      (3)   The penalties for the misdemeanors set forth in division (b)(1) and
(2) of this section shall be as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (4)   A.   Notwithstanding division (a) of this section, upon a finding
that such person operated a motor vehicle in a construction zone where a sign
was then posted in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.98, the court, in addition to
all other penalties provided by law, shall impose a fine of two times the usual
amount imposed for the violation. No court shall impose a fine of two times the
usual amount imposed for the violation upon an offender who alleges, in an

division, provided the court determines that the offender is an indigent person
and is unable to pay the fine.
         B.   As used in this division “construction zone” shall have the
meaning given that term in Ohio R.C. 5501.26.

this Traffic Code that is substantially equivalent to a provision of the
Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to suspend a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a violation of that
provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties authorized by law, may
suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the court determines
appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the violation of the
provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of suspension that
is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the provision of
the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is substantially
equivalent.

in driving upon any such street or portion thereof.
311.05   TOY VEHICLES UPON ROADWAY AND PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (a)   No person upon roller skates or a skateboard, or riding in or by means
of any sled, toy vehicle or similar device, shall go upon any roadway except
while crossing a street on a crosswalk and except upon streets set aside as
play streets when and as authorized by the Director of Public Safety.
   (b)   No person upon a skateboard or like device shall go upon the adjacent
premises, including the parking lot area, of any commercial or business
establishment without the consent of the owner. No person, while in possession
of a skateboard or like device, shall go upon the parking lot area or other
private property of any commercial establishment at any time when such premises
are not open to the public for business, except with the consent of the owner.
   (c)   Whenever any person operates any of the devices mentioned in division
(a) of this section in violation of this section, such device shall be seized
by any member of the Police Department. The Chief of Police shall impound such
device at the Police Station for 30 days.
   (d)   When any such device has been seized and so impounded, written notice
or personal service shall be made forthwith by the officer in charge to the
owner of such device, or, in the event the person is a minor under the age of
18 years, then such notice shall be made to the parent or guardian of the owner
of such device. The notice shall contain a full explanation of the reason for
seizing and impounding such device.
   (e)   Any device impounded under the provisions of this section shall be
surrendered to the owner or to the parent or guardian of any minor after the
expiration of the impounding time set by the Chief of Police and upon showing
sufficient proof of ownership of such device. However, nothing herein shall
relieve the offender of any penalty imposed in Section
303.99.
(Ord. 1992-35. Passed 11-23-92.)
311.06   MINIMUM CHILD POPULATION.
   The Director of Public Safety is granted special power to prohibit
commercial vehicles, other than those making deliveries to properties located
on the street, from using any street which, in his opinion, has such a large
child population as to substantially increase the chances of accidents
involving motor vehicles on such street. A minimum child population average of
at least 2.0 children under 18 years of age for each house on the street must
be present before the Mayor can prohibit the street from being used by
commercial vehicles, using the authority granted by this section.
311.07   UNSAFE CONDITIONS.
   (a)   The Director of Public Safety is granted emergency power to prohibit
all vehicles, either for commercial or pleasure purposes or for both, from
making use of any street which, in his opinion, is in such poor condition as to
warrant its temporary closing.
   (b)   This same power is granted to the Director of Public Safety when, in
his opinion, it is necessary to shut off vehicular traffic from a street
because of the dangers incident to fire, flood, collapse of a building, police
action, snow, ice, enemy action or because such a street or part thereof has
been temporarily placed into use for recreational purposes.
311.08   PROCEDURE.
   The Director of Public Safety's decisions regarding the use of streets by
vehicular traffic shall be directed to the Chiefs of Police and Fire, and once
he orders traffic to be controlled in any manner authorized by this chapter,
any person who disobeys such order shall be punished according to Section
311.99.
311.09   BARRICADES.
   The Director of Public Safety is given the authority to cause barricades to
be erected by the Departments of Police, Fire or Public Service in order to
assist him in the enforcement of any action taken under the foregoing sections
of this chapter, and anyone removing or damaging such barricades shall be
punished as set forth in Section
311.99.
311.10   CONSTRUCTION IN STREETS; FLAGMAN REQUIRED.
   (a)   At all places where construction work of any nature whatsoever is
being done within the dedicated right-of-way of streets, roads and highways
within the City, the person performing such work shall have present at the work
site a flagman, whose full responsibility shall be to direct and warn vehicular
traffic and other users of the highway of the conditions then existing, so as
to avoid accidents or injury to persons or property. The flagman shall have a
red flag signaling device, not less than 12 inches square, mounted on a holding
bar from which the red flag will drape or fall so as to be clearly visible.
When required by the Director of Public Safety, the flagman shall be on the job
site at all times during which work is actually being performed.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree.

313.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
313.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
313.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.
(ORC 4511.14)
313.06   FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 313.06 was repealed as part of the 2013 updating and
revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially equivalent State
law (Ohio R.C. 4511.15) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
313.07   UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No person shall place, maintain, or display upon or in view of any
highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of, or resembles a traffic-control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic- control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
   (b)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking, or device is a public
nuisance, and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway may remove the
same or cause it to be removed.
(ORC 4511.16)
313.08   ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No person, without lawful authority, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Knowingly move, deface, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly

intended to protect it;
      (3)   Knowingly move, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly tamper
with a manhole cover.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (a)(1) or (3) of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree. If a violation of division (a)(1) or (3) of this section creates a risk
of physical harm to any person, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the

315.04   TICKET.
   (a)   A traffic law violation for which a ticket is issued by the City
pursuant to
Chapter 315 is a civil violation. If the City issues a ticket for such a
violation, the ticket shall comply with the requirements of this section.
   (b)   The City or its designee shall process such a ticket for a civil
violation and shall file the ticket with the Parma Municipal Court in
compliance with the Court's rules and regulations relating to such tickets. The

the Court's rules, a ticket charging the registered owner with the violation
that is the subject of the traffic law violation. The City or designee shall
ensure that the ticket contains all of the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner;
      (2)   The letters and numerals appearing on the license plate issued to
the motor vehicle;

vehicle was involved in a traffic law violation, and a statement indicating
that the recorded images are prima facie evidence of that traffic law
violation, both of which may be signed electronically;
      (9)   Information advising the person or entity alleged to be liable of
the options prescribed in Section
315.05, specifically to include the time, place, and manner in which an appeal
may be initiated and the procedure for disclaiming liability by submitting an
affidavit as prescribed in that section;
      (10)   A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in Section
315.05 is deemed to be an admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity
to contest the violation.
   (c)   The City or its designee shall send a ticket not later than 30 days
after the date of the alleged traffic law violation.
(Ord. 2009-26. Passed 11-23-09. Ord. 2012-19. Passed 5-21-12; Ord. 2015-10.
Passed 3-9-15; Ord. 2022-2. Passed 3-14-22.)
315.05   PROCEDURE.
   (a)   A person or entity who receives a ticket for a civil violation sent in
compliance with Section
315.04 shall elect to do one of the following:
      (1)   In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the opportunity to
contest the violation;
      (2)   Within 30 days after receipt of the ticket, provide the court with
either of the following affidavits:
         A.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
         B.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at the
time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to the
motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or control
of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant permission
to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the
license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation and therefore
were not under the control or possession of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a report about the
stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the appropriate law
enforcement agency prior to the violation or within 48 hours after the
violation occurred.
      (3)   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within 30 days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the registered
owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (a)(2)A. or B. of this
section to the court in a form established by court and the following
conditions are met:
         A.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (a)(2)A. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request a
hearing within 30 days or is determined liable in a hearing;
         B.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (a)(2)B. of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division.
      (4)   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the Court of the name and address of the
lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
A motor vehicle leasing dealer or motor vehicle renting dealer who receives a
ticket for an alleged traffic law violation detected by a traffic law photo
monitoring device is not liable for a ticket issued for a motor vehicle that
was in the care, custody, or control of a lessee or renter at the time of the
alleged violation. The dealer shall not pay such a ticket and subsequently
attempt to collect a fee or assess the lessee or renter a charge for any
payment of such a ticket made on behalf of the lessee or renter.
      (5)   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the Court an affidavit, sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the
corporate entity, that provides the name and address of the employee who was
operating the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and who is the
designated party.
      (6)   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for a hearing to
review the ticket. The person or entity shall file the written request not
later than 30 days after receipt of the ticket. The failure to request a
hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver of the right to contest
the violation and ticket, and is deemed to constitute an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
   (b)   If the Court receives an affidavit described in division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(4) of this section or a notification under division (a)(3) of this section
from a registered owner, the Court may proceed to notify the City to send a
ticket that conforms with Section 315.04(b) to the designated party. The Court
shall send the ticket to the designated party by ordinary mail not later than
21 days after receipt of the notification.
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 3-9-15; Ord. 2022-2. Passed 3-14-22.)
315.06   APPEAL.
   (a)   When a person or entity named in a ticket for a civil violation under
Section
315.04(a) elects to contest the ticket and completes the requirements
prescribed in
315.05(a)(5) in a timely manner, all of the following apply:
      (1)   The Parma Municipal Court shall conduct a hearing no later than 180
days after the filing of a written request for the hearing. The Court may
extend the time period by which a hearing must be conducted upon a request for
additional time by any party.
      (2)   The Court shall ensure that the hearing is open to the public. The
Court shall post a docket in a conspicuous place near the entrance to the
hearing room. The Court shall identify on the docket, by respondent, the
hearings scheduled for that day and the time of each hearing. The Court may
schedule multiple hearings for the same time to allow for occurrences such as
nonappearances or admissions of liability.
      (3)   The person who requested the hearing or a representative of the
entity that requested the hearing shall appear for the hearing and may present
evidence at the hearing.
      (4)   The Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the evidence
establishes that the violation alleged in the ticket did in fact occur and that
the person or entity requesting the review is the person who was operating the
vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (b)   (1)   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or entity
named in the ticket is the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of
the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision imposing liability for
the violation upon the individual or entity and submit it to the City or its
designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
      (2)   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact occur but the person
or entity named in the ticket is not the person who was operating the vehicle
at the time of the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision finding
that the individual or entity is not liable for the violation and submit it to
the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
      (3)   If the person who requested the Court hearing or a representative
of the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the hearing, the
Court shall determine that the person or entity is liable for the violation. In
such a case, the Court shall issue a written decision imposing liability for
the violation upon the individual or entity and submit it to the local
authority or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
      (4)   The Court shall render a decision on the day a hearing takes place.
   (c)   (1)   In determining whether the person or entity named in the ticket
is liable, the Court may consider any of the following as an affirmative
defense to a traffic law violation:
         A.   That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to
yield the right-of-way to either of the following:
            1.   A public safety vehicle or coroner's vehicle in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 4511.45 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   A funeral procession in accordance with Section
331.24 of the Codified Ordinances.
         B.   That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen prior to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the
control or possession of the registered owner at the time of the violation. In
order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen prior
to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the violation, the registered owner
shall submit proof that a report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the
traffic law violation or within 48 hours after the traffic law violation
occurred.
         C.   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the traffic law photo-
monitoring device was not in proper position and the recorded image is not of
sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the information
necessary to impose liability.
         D.   That the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket
was not the person operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. In
order to meet the evidentiary burden imposed under division (c)(1)D. of this
section, the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket shall
provide to the Court the identity of the designated party, that person's name
and current address, and any other evidence that the Court determines to be
pertinent.
      (2)   A Court also may consider the totality of the circumstances when
determining whether to impose liability upon the person or entity named in the
ticket.
   (d)   (1)   If the Court finds that the person or entity named in the ticket
was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation
or receives evidence identifying the designated party, the Court shall provide
to the City or its designee, within five days of the hearing, a copy of any
evidence substantiating the identity of the designated party.
      (2)   Upon receipt of evidence of the identity of the designated party,
the City or its designee may issue a ticket to the designated party.
      (3)   The City shall ensure that a ticket issued under division (d)(2) of
this section conforms with Section
315.04(b). The City or its designee shall file the ticket not later than 21
days after receipt of the evidence from the Court or the registered owner of
the identity of the designated party.
   (e)   If a designated party who is issued a ticket under division (d)(2) of
this Section or
315.05(b) contests the ticket by filing a written request for a hearing to
review the ticket not later than 30 days after receipt of the ticket, the Court
shall require the registered owner of the motor vehicle also to attend the
hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party, the Court cannot
determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The Court then
shall issue a written decision imposing liability for the violation on the
registered owner and submit it to the City or its designee and to the
registered owner. If the designated party also is a registered owner of the
vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the order of registered
owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (f)   A person who is named in a ticket for a civil violation may assert a
testimonial privilege in accordance with Ohio R.C. 2317.02(D).
   (g)   No decision rendered under this section, and no admission of liability
under this section or Section
315.04, is admissible as evidence in any other judicial proceeding in this
State.
   (h)   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation, sworn
to or affirmed by a law enforcement officer employed by the City, including by
electronic means, and the recorded images produced by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and
is admissible in a proceeding for review of the ticket issued under this
section.

315.07   CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a citation from a

the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:

left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the

   (c)   Prosecution; Limitation on Convictions. In any proceeding arising out
of one incident, a person may be charged with a violation of division (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or (b)
of this section or for an equivalent offense, the court may admit evidence on
the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them in the
defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily
substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of
the substance withdrawn within two hours of the time of the alleged violation.
When a person submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement
officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, only a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw blood for the purpose of determining
the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content of the whole blood, blood serum,
or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or
urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may
refuse to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person's opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn shall be analyzed in accordance with methods
approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit
issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense, if there was at the time the bodily
substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the applicable
concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. The person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. The form to be read to the person to be
tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall state that the
person may have an independent test performed at the person's expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the blood,
breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field
sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in the violation and if
it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the
test in substantial compliance with the testing standards for any reliable,
credible, and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at
the time the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any
testing standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
C., D., E., F., G., H., or I. or (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section or
for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those
divisions, a laboratory report from any forensic laboratory certified by the
Department of Health that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains
all of the information specified in this division shall be admitted as prima
facie evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, or a combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and any hospital,
first-aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant
to this section, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability based
upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a claim of
malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the person. The
immunity provided in this division is not available to a person who withdraws
blood if the person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a
violation of division (a), (b) or (m) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
      (3)    The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (5)   Advice required. The arresting law enforcement officer shall give
advice in accordance with this division to any person under arrest for a
violation of division (a), (b) or (m) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a
written form that contains the information described in division (g)(6) of this
section and shall read the advice to the person. The form shall contain a
statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest and read to the
person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall witness the
arresting officer's reading of the form, and the witnesses shall certify to
this fact by signing the form.
      (6)   Certification of arrest. If a person is under arrest as described
in division (g)(5) of this section, before the person may be requested to
submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the alcohol and drug content of
the person's blood, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol
consumption; or having physical control of a vehicle while under the
influence).
         If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior O.V.I. or O.V.U.A.C.
conviction under State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are
now under arrest for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test,
you will face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the
State O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol in your blood, breath, or urine as set by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (7)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C.
4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-
state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person and
immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to appear
on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the person's
license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer shall order
the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs the
officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency
immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in which the
person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or permit, the
court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial appearance and any
action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (8)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, if the officer advises the
person in accordance with this section of the consequences of the person's
refusal or submission, and if either the person refuses to submit to the test
or tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of division (m) of this
section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
the person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a
prohibited concentration of alcohol in the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   That the officer asked the person to take the designated
chemical test or tests, advised the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and
gave the person the form described in division (g)(6) of this section;
               d.   That either the person refused to submit to the chemical
test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the
chemical test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration
of alcohol in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
at the time of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(8)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (m) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol that the test results
indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
or urine.
      (9)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (10)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (11)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (m) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(5).
      (6)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under division (h)(1)C., D., or E. of this section is assigned or
transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any
other penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to Section
698.02(f) or Ohio R.C. 2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five
thousand dollars ($5,000) for any economic loss arising from an accident or
collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s operation
of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for which the
offender is sentenced under division (h) of this section.
      (8)   As used in division (g) of this section, “electronic monitoring”
has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2929.01.
   (i)   Penalty for Operating a Vehicle After Underage Alcohol Consumption.
Whoever violates division (b) of this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C.
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, the court shall suspend
any jail term imposed under division (h)(1) of this section as required under
that section;
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
or (b) of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction
imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the
offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(4). The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13;
      (3)   If the offender also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court
imposes a jail term for the violation of division (b) of this section, the
court shall impose upon the offender an additional definite jail term pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2929.24(E).
      (4)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Section
698.02(f) or Ohio R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars
($5,000) for any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was

Chapter 3793 by the Director of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.
   (k)   If a person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined
in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.

field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including

sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (m)(3)A.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         B.   Division (m)(3)A. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (m)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (m) is guilty of having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. In addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on

commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio
R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege has
been suspended for being convicted of, or pleading guilty to, an OVI offense
under any of the following:
         A.   Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(a) or (H)(1);
         B.   Ohio R.C. 4510.07 for a municipal OVI offense when the offense is
equivalent to an offense under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(a) or (H)(1);
         C.   Ohio R.C. 4510.17(B) or (D) when the offense is equivalent to an

      (2)   “OVI offense” means a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or a violation
of a substantially similar municipal ordinance or law of another state or the
United States.
      (3)   “Unlimited driving privileges” means driving privileges that are
unrestricted as to purpose, time, and place, but that are subject to any other
reasonable conditions imposed by a court under division (c)(2) of this section.
   (b)   A first-time offender may file a petition for unlimited driving
privileges with a certified ignition interlock device during the period of
suspension imposed for an OVI offense in the same manner and in the same venue
as the person is permitted to apply for limited driving privileges.
   (c)   (1)   With regard to a first-time offender, in any circumstance in
which a court is authorized to grant limited driving privileges under Ohio R.C.
4510.021, 4510.13, or 4510.17 during the period of suspension, as applicable,
the court may instead grant unlimited driving privileges with a certified
ignition interlock device. No court shall grant unlimited driving privileges
with a certified ignition interlock device during any period, or under any
circumstance, that the court is prohibited from granting limited driving
privileges.
      (2)   All of the following apply when a court grants unlimited driving
privileges with a certified ignition interlock device to a first-time offender:
         A.   1.   The court shall issue an order authorizing the first-time
offender to operate a motor vehicle only if the vehicle is equipped with a
certified ignition interlock device, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.43
(C). The order may include any reasonable conditions other than conditions that
restrict the driving privileges in terms of purpose, time, or place.
            2.   The court shall provide to the first-time offender a copy of
the order and a notice that the first-time offender is subject to the sanctions
specified in division (e) of this section.
            3.   The court also shall submit a copy of the order to the
registrar of motor vehicles.
         B.   The court may reduce the period of suspension imposed by the
court by an amount of time not greater than half the period of suspension.
         C.   The court shall suspend any jail term imposed for the OVI
offense. The court shall retain jurisdiction over the first-time offender until
the expiration of the period of suspension imposed for the OVI offense and, if
the offender violates any term or condition of the order during the period of
suspension, the court shall require the first-time offender to serve the jail
term.
   (d)   (1)   A first-time offender shall present to the registrar or to a
deputy registrar an order issued under this section and a certificate affirming
the installation of a certified ignition interlock device that is in a form
established by the director of public safety and that is signed by the person
who installed the device. Upon presentation of the order and certificate to the
registrar or a deputy registrar, the registrar or deputy registrar shall issue
the offender a restricted license, unless the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit is suspended under any other provision of law and
limited driving privileges have not been granted with regard to that
suspension. A restricted license issued under this division shall be identical
to an Ohio driver's license, except that it shall have printed on its face a
statement that the offender is prohibited from operating any motor vehicle that
is not equipped with a certified ignition interlock device.
      (2)   A.   No person who has been granted unlimited driving privileges
with a certified ignition interlock device under this section shall operate a

this prohibition is subject to the penalties prescribed in Ohio R.C. 4510.14.
         B.   The offense established under division (d)(2)A. of this section
is a strict liability offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply.
   (e)   If a first-time offender has been granted unlimited driving privileges
with a certified ignition interlock device under this section and the first-
time offender either commits an ignition interlock device violation as defined
under Ohio R.C. 4510.46 or the first-time offender operates a motor vehicle
that is not equipped with a certified ignition interlock device, the following
applies:
      (1)   On a first violation, the court may require the first-time offender
to wear a monitor that provides continuous alcohol monitoring that is remote.
      (2)   On a second violation, the court shall require the first-time
offender to wear a monitor that provides continuous alcohol monitoring that is
remote for a minimum of 40 days.
      (3)   On a third or subsequent violation, the court shall require the
first-time offender to wear a monitor that provides continuous alcohol
monitoring that is remote for a minimum of 60 days.
      (4)   With regard to any instance, the judge may increase the period of
suspension and the period during which the first-time offender must drive a
motor vehicle equipped with a certified ignition interlock device in the same
manner as provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.13(A)(8)(c). The limitation under Ohio
R.C. 4510.46(E) applies to an increase under division (e)(4) of this section.
      (5)   If the instance occurred within 60 days of the end of the
suspension of the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit
or nonresident operating privilege and the court does not increase the period
of the suspension under division (e)(4) of this section, the court shall
proceed as follows:
         A.   Issue an order extending the period of suspension and the period
of time during which the first-time offender must drive a vehicle equipped with
a certified ignition interlock device so that the suspension terminates 60 days
from the date the offender committed that violation.
         B.   1.   For each violation subsequent to a violation for which an
extension was ordered under division (e)(5)A. of this section, issue an order
extending the period of suspension and the period of time during which the
first-time offender must drive a vehicle equipped with a certified ignition
interlock device so that the suspension terminates 60 days from the date the
offender committed that violation.
            2.   The registrar of motor vehicles is prohibited from reinstating
a first-time offender's license unless the applicable period of suspension has
been served and no ignition interlock device violations have been committed
within the 60 days prior to the application for reinstatement.
   (f)   (1)   With respect to an order issued under this section, the judge
shall impose an additional court cost of two dollars fifty cents ($2.50) upon
the first-time offender. The judge shall not waive this payment unless the
judge determines that the first-time offender is indigent and waives the
payment of all court costs imposed upon the indigent first-time offender. The
clerk of court shall transmit 100 percent of this mandatory court cost
collected during a month on or before the twenty-third day of the following
month to the State treasury to be credited to the State Highway Safety fund
created under Ohio R.C. 4501.06. The Department of Public Safety shall use the
amounts collected to cover costs associated with maintaining the habitual OVI/
OMWI offender registry created under Ohio R.C. 5502.10.
      (2)   A judge may impose an additional court cost of two dollars fifty
cents ($2.50) upon the first-time offender. The clerk of court shall retain
this discretionary two dollar fifty cent ($2.50) court cost, if imposed. The
clerk shall deposit it in the court's special projects fund that is established
under Ohio R.C. 2303.201(E)(1), Ohio R.C. 1901.26(B)(1), or Ohio R.C. 1907.24

line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-
way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by divisions(b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section. The end of every
school zone may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in
this section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of
Traffic-Control Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be
indicated by signs equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other
special notice of the hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.

portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of

(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school

in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone

   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4)
or (a)(5) of this section has occurred, it shall be prima facie evidence that
the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender's control is in a
category described in division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this

division (a)(1), (a)(3) or (a)(5) of this section, the offender and the
operator of the motor vehicle reside in the same household and are related by
consanguinity or affinity.
      (2)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in
division (a)(2) of this section, the offender and the operator of the motor
vehicle reside in the same household, and the offender knows or has reasonable

license, permit, or privilege.
      (3)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in
division (a)(4) of this section, the offender and the operator of the motor
vehicle occupied the motor vehicle together at the time of the offense.

         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.203, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order, for 60 days, the
immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of
that vehicle’s license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and
enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

from the immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization
ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

698.03 or Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

RESPONSIBILITY OR IN VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
335.07 was repealed as part of the 2005-C updating and revision of these

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section

applicable. The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered
under this section unless the court is presented with current proof of
financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's

determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer's view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined

issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
   (c)   (1)   The application for a permit issued under this section shall be
in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe a
permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
      (2)   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
      (3)   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
   (d)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling permit
under division (a)(1) of this section upon application and payment of the
applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(2) of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
   (e)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the vehicle
or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection
by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit.
No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
   (f)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
   (g)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
   (h)   (1)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to gross load limits.
      (2)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
      (3)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (i)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the

motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the
municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is a
leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee
presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all
towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for towing and
storing motor vehicles.
         C.   If a person is charged with a violation of division (f)(1)A.1. or

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or

plates if the parking card or accessible license plates issued to the person or
organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or revoked.

(Ord. 1983-16. Passed 4-11-83.)
351.055   PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW- AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures.
         The phrase does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the
municipal corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service
shall give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle's license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief's order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4513.61 to
4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (h) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4513.601.
   (g)   Whoever violates division (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow- away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101
(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
      (2)   A.   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and
to the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)
(3) of this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7)
of this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the

cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to

conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or
2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of
either of those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for
that violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16,
2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.01 or Ohio R.C. 2903.02
if the conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4,
2023, and applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity
in committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy,
attempt, or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution
for that conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section
as it existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.10   FALSIFICATION.

following applies:

another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

sheriff pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.125 in order to obtain or renew a concealed
handgun license or is made in an affidavit submitted to a county sheriff to
obtain a concealed handgun license on a temporary emergency basis under Ohio
R.C. 2923.1213.
      (15)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.72 in connection
with the person's purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   No person, in connection with the purchase of a firearm as defined in

   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

altered document that purports to be certification of the person’s competence
in handling a handgun as described in division (B)(3) of that section.

an offense of violence.
   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.

      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege
or advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground
for excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.
   (g)   Division (a) or (d) of this section does not require disclosure of

immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.
5119.36.

actor in the course of the actor's duties in connection with a bona fide
program for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are
violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or Ohio R.C. 2907.05 or to victims of felonious
sexual penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12. As used in this
division, "counseling services" include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

619.01   SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter may be cited as the Parma Heights Clean Indoor Air Ordinance.
(Ord. 1987-28. Passed 8-10-87.)
619.02   FINDINGS; INTENT.
   (a)   Council finds that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air
pollution and that smoking in enclosed areas is detrimental to the health,
welfare, comfort and environment of nonsmokers; that exposure to secondhand
smoke is acutely harmful to nonsmokers with cardiovascular or respiratory
disease; that the United States Surgeon General has determined that involuntary
smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers;
that smoking in certain enclosed areas is a public nuisance and a cause of
material annoyance, discomfort and physical irritation to nonsmokers; that
nonsmokers who suffer ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke may experience
a loss of job productivity and may be prevented from using commercial
establishments and other public places; that smoking is a major cause of fires,
as well as burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures that cause losses
to businesses in the City; that courtesy and voluntary smoking restrictions are
not sufficient in all cases to adequately resolve concerns relating to
secondhand smoke; and that nonsmokers presently have no adequate means to
protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them when they involuntarily
inhale smoke emitted from cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other smoking
materials.
   (b)   Council intends that the restrictions and limitations of this chapter
be viewed as minimum standards and should not be construed as limiting in any
way the authority of the persons in charge of public places or places of
employment from entirely prohibiting smoking within their establishments or any
part thereof. It is not the intent of Council to prohibit smoking or the sale
of tobacco products, but rather to affirm the right of nonsmokers to breathe
clean air.

section (Ordinance 1987-28, passed August 10, 1987), each employer of ten or
more employees shall adopt, implement and maintain a written smoking policy
which contains, at a minimum, the restrictions in this section, the rights and
responsibilities of employees and actions that will be taken to ensure that the
policy is effective. The policy shall be communicated to all employees within
three weeks of its adoption and at least yearly thereafter. All employers shall
supply a written copy of the smoking policy to any prospective employee who so
requests and to all new employees within one week of commencing their
employment. This division shall not be interpreted or construed to exempt
employers of fewer than ten employees from any other requirement of this
chapter.
      (2)   Signs. Signs indicating whether or not smoking is permitted shall
be clearly, sufficiently and conspicuously posted in every room, building or
other place managed by the employer and regulated by this chapter. The employer
shall provide signs indicating that smoking is prohibited to any employee

elevator lobbies, stairwells, escalators and hallways shall be posted in
elevators, in elevator lobbies on each floor and in stairwell and escalator
entrances on each floor.
      (3)   Ashtrays. Ashtrays shall be removed from areas where smoking is
prohibited, except that an ashtray may be placed by the entrance of a no-
smoking area, provided that such area is clearly marked as a no-smoking area.
      (4)   Enforcement. Persons smoking in violation of the employer's smoking
policy or this chapter shall be requested to stop.
      (5)   Resolution of disputes. In any dispute arising under the employer's
smoking policy or this chapter, the rights of the nonsmoker shall be given
preference over consideration of the smoker.
      (6)   Work areas. If, due to the proximity of smokers, size of the work
area, poor ventilation or other factors, the restrictions in this section do
not reduce the effects of smoke in an employee's work area to the satisfaction
of the employee, the employer shall make additional accommodation by
reassigning the employee to a different work area, by further restricting
smoking in the place of employment or by implementing other measures reasonably
designed to minimize or eliminate the effects of smoke on the employee.
      (7)   Nondiscrimination. No employer shall discharge, refuse to hire or
in any manner discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment
because such employee or applicant exercises on behalf of himself, herself or
others any rights afforded him or her by the employer's smoking policy or by
this chapter.
(Ord. 1987-28. Passed 8-10-87.)

(Ord. 1987-28. Passed 8-10-87.)
619.07   DESIGNATION OF SMOKING AREAS.

Where smoking areas are designated, signs indicating that smoking is permitted
shall be posted pursuant to Sections
619.04(c)(1) and
619.05(c)(2).
   (a)   Number and Size. Not more than 50% of the total floor space of any
establishment, or portion thereof, within Section
619.04(b) or

   (b)   Barriers and Ventilation. Smoking areas may be designated using
existing barriers and ventilation systems to the maximum extent practicable,

engineering practices to further minimize the migration of smoke to adjacent
no-smoking areas, provided that persons undertaking such modification shall not
be required to incur any expense to meet the requirements of this division.
Where new establishments are constructed, barriers and ventilation systems

with good engineering practices, to minimize the migration and recirculation of
smoke to no-smoking areas.
   (c)   Placement. A smoking area may not be designated adjacent to an indoor
service line or between a no-smoking area and the source of fresh air. Where
practicable, smoking areas shall not be designated such that nonsmokers would

job duties, to patronize an establishment or to reach a no-smoking area.
Special consideration shall be given to individuals with a hypersensitivity to
tobacco smoke.
   (d)   Prohibition Permitted. This section shall not be interpreted or
construed to require persons in charge of places set forth in Section

619.05(b) to provide smoking areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, any proprietor or employer in charge of an establishment may declare
the entire establishment as a no-smoking area.
(Ord. 1987-28. Passed 8-10-87.)

minor misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during

619.09   ENFORCEMENT BY FIRE DEPARTMENT.
   Enforcement of this chapter shall be implemented by the Fire Department
which shall:
   (a)   Establish a telephone number through which all complaints by citizens
relating to violations of this chapter may be directed or referred;
   (b)   Require, while an establishment is undergoing otherwise mandated
inspections, a “self-certification” from the owner, manager, operator or other
person having control of such establishment that all requirements of this
chapter have been complied with. Other Municipal departments conducting
otherwise mandated inspections shall cooperate with the Fire Department in
obtaining such self- certifications.
   (c)   For establishments found out of compliance with this chapter or
receiving repeated citizen complaints:
      (1)   Provide to the proprietor or employer a copy of this chapter and
such advisory assistance to rectify future violations as may be necessary to
achieve compliance with this chapter;
      (2)   Follow up such investigation and advice with a written directive
explaining, in detail, the steps required in order to achieve future compliance
with this chapter; and
      (3)   If the violations do not cease within 30 days after issuing such
directive, request commencement of a civil and/or criminal proceeding by the
Department of Law, as may be appropriate pursuant to Section
619.08.
(Ord. 1987-28. Passed 8-10-87.)
619.10   EDUCATION.
   The Fire Department shall engage in a continuing program to inform and
clarify the purposes of this chapter to citizens affected by it, and to guide
proprietors and employers in their compliance. The Fire Department shall
prepare guidelines for the designation of smoking areas, including but not
limited to the number, size, barriers, ventilation and placement of such areas,
and shall encourage proprietors and employers to utilize the guidelines in
designating such areas.
(Ord. 1987-28. Passed 8-10-87.)
619.11   COOPERATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AND EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.
   The Mayor shall annually request such governmental and educational agencies
not under the jurisdiction of the City, having offices within the City, to
establish local operating procedures to cooperate and comply with this chapter,
and shall urge enforcement of their existing smoking restrictions.
(Ord. 1987-28. Passed 8-10-87.)

smoke.

by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer's education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the

attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a
duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,

tobacco products, or alternative nicotine products.
      (6)   Whoever violates division (b)(2)B. or (b)(4) of this section is

seller, agent or employee raises and proves as an affirmative defense that all
of the following occurred:

tobacco products, or alternative nicotine products presented a driver’s or

implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of division (a) of this

shall consider that reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan may require a seller or an agent or employee of

transaction scan device does not excuse a seller or an agent or employee of a
seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
         A.   Whether a person to whom the seller or agent or employee of a
seller sells, gives away or otherwise distributes cigarettes, other tobacco
products, or alternative nicotine products is 21 years of age or older;

634.01   PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   The purpose of this chapter is to set forth standards for the declaration of
a property or condition as a public nuisance, to declare vacant properties as
nuisances, to authorize the abatement of nuisances by the City and to establish
the procedures for the abatement of nuisances, in order to prevent hazards to

value of neighboring properties.
(Ord. 2017-11. Passed 5-22-17.)
634.02   AUTHORITY TO INSPECT PROPERTIES WHERE NUISANCES EXIST AND TO ABATE
NUISANCE CONDITIONS.

including a Codified Ordinance, as a nuisance, the Director of Public Service,
or their designees, are authorized and directed promptly to enter and inspect
the premises or structure where such nuisance is found to exist to determine
the extent and nature of the nuisance and whether it has been abated, provided
permission to enter or inspect is obtained from the owner or his or her agent.
If such permission is refused or is otherwise unobtainable, a search warrant
shall be obtained before such entry or inspection is made, except in the case
of an existing emergency in which case entry or inspection may be made at any
time and no search warrant is necessary. No person shall refuse to permit such

nuisance.
   (b)   In addition to the authority granted in subsection (a) of this

public ways adjacent thereto, by falling or being cast therein;

634.05   ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE; COLLECTION OF COSTS; ASSESSMENT.

City as determined herein, the owner or agent shall be responsible for payment
to the City of the actual costs incurred by the City in preparing to abate the
nuisance if the City does not proceed with the abatement or in preparing to
abate and abating the nuisance, plus the City's actual administrative costs
applied as a percentage of the total cost incurred by the City, as approved
annually by the Director of Finance. Should the City's actual costs in abating
such nuisance be less than the estimate, and the owner has paid to the City an
amount equal to such estimated amount, then the City shall refund to the owner
the amount of the difference.

communicate with or locate the owner or a party in control.
      (3)   "Occupied." The term "occupied" shall mean the presence of a person
or persons either:
         A.   Living in a structure and using some portion of such structure as
a dwelling unit, as defined in the Housing Code of the City, or
         B.   Working in a structure and using some portion of the structure
for the operation of a business.
      (4)   "Property." The term "property" shall mean all portions of the real
estate of a parcel in the City, including lands and structures of every type.
   (b)   Any property that contains a structure that is vacant or abandoned
shall be considered a nuisance unless and until the owner, agent, lessee or
party in control of the property shall, at minimum, take all actions required
in this section. The exterior of a vacant or abandoned structure, including the
property and structure, shall be maintained in compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the City, and the interior shall be maintained in a safe, secure
and preserved manner to prevent and abate any threat to the health or safety of
the public or anyone entering the structure, and to prevent and abate any
threat of fire or health violation, or to its structural or historical
integrity. The structure shall be winterized to prevent the freezing of pipes,
and all points of entry shall be kept locked and secure. Sufficient property
and liability insurance shall be maintained covering the property up to an
amount at least equal to the fair market value of the property. The City shall
provide the insurance carrier, if known, and any lien holder of record for the
property a written notice of the requirements of this section and that the
property is considered a vacant or abandoned structure. The City may require an
owner or agent of a vacant or abandoned property in violation of this section
or any other ordinance applicable to the property or structure to provide proof
of insurance, and no owner or agent shall fail to provide such proof when so
ordered.
   (c)   The Director may take any action necessary to inspect a vacant or
abandoned property, and to abate a vacant or abandoned property nuisance, as
authorized in this chapter. Upon inspection of a vacant or abandoned structure,
the Director may take any action authorized by law to ensure that the property,
including the structure, is maintained according to the requirements of all
applicable ordinances.
   (d)   No person, other than the owner, agent, lessee or other person with
lawful control of or access to a vacant property that is deemed to be a
nuisance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or abandoned pursuant to
subsection (a) of this section, may enter, remain on, or refuse to leave, or
alter or destroy, the grounds or any structure on such property. Any person who
violates such prohibition, shall be deemed to have entered, remained on,
refused to leave, altered or destroyed the property of another without that
person's consent, and without the privilege, authority or permission to do so,
as such terms are used in Chapter 642 of the Codified Ordinances. Any person
who violates this subsection may be ordered by the Police or any authorized
person to leave the premises or the Police may arrest such person for violating
this subsection or a provision of Chapter 642. Any vehicle remaining on the
grounds of such a property that is not titled in the name of the owner or the
ownership is unknown, or that is otherwise in violation of any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be deemed to be parked without the consent,
authority or permission of the owner, agent, lessee or party in control of the
property. The prohibitions in this subsection do not apply to any employee or
agent of any governmental entity, including the City, which has the lawful
authority to enter such property, when such person is acting in their official
capacity as an employee or agent.
   (e)   Any vacant property that has been deemed to be a nuisance or abandoned
pursuant to this section shall be considered to be in the custody of the City,
and the City shall be deemed to be the lawful agent of the owner of the
property, solely for the purposes of Chapter 642 of the Codified Ordinances.
This subsection confers no authority to or duty upon the City over a property
as an agent or custodian other than to protect such properties from trespassers
or other persons who may enter such properties without the authority, consent
or privilege to do so from the lawful owner, agent, lessee, or party in control
or possession of such properties, and who may vandalize and damage the grounds
or structures thereon leading to further deterioration and neighborhood blight.
This subsection confers no new or different authority or duty on the City as to
the condition, safety or security of any private property other than the
specific authority conferred expressly herein, and such authority is in
addition to, and not in derogation or substitution of, the authority of the
City pursuant to its police powers. This subsection is not intended to, nor
does it, require the City to be or make the City responsible or liable to any
person for the condition, safety or security of any private property.
   (f)   The Director or the Director's designee may file a complaint with the
Police Department or Prosecutor of the City based on any violation of
subsection (d) of this section or any violation under Chapter 642 of the
Codified Ordinances against a property that is in the custody of the City or
for which the City is deemed the agent of the owner pursuant to this section.
The Police or Prosecutor may take any lawful action including, but not limited
to, the filing of a criminal complaint in Municipal Court against any person
who violates any provision of Chapter 642 of the Codified Ordinances or
subsection (d) of this section.

defendant knew was pregnant at the time of the offense) that was included in
the indictment, count in the indictment or information charging the offense,
the court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term as provided in
R.C. § 2929.24(F).

has not previously been convicted or pleaded guilty to a violation of division
(a)(2) of this section or any substantially equivalent state law or municipal
ordinance, the person is guilty of a minor misdemeanor;
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if the person has

and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section
or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by
law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not contraband, the officer
shall return the firearm to the person at the termination of the stop. If a

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as

for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and 698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail
term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other
than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
                  (Ord. 2003-38. Passed 12-15-03.)
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections 666.99 or 698.02 of this
Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a sentence upon an
offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or
combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another State, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2005-C updating and revision of these
Codified Ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C.

698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

765.01   PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limit or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in Ordinance No. 1996-
5 and in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41
(1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v.
City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in
other communities including but not limited to Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis,
Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier,
California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
Cleveland, Ohio; Beaumont, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Newport News, Virginia;
Bellevue, Washington; New York, New York; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and
also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General, Working Group on the
Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota),
the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises;
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments;
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or cubicles for viewing film, videos, or live sex shows;
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions;
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses;
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United
States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983; 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448
through December 31, 1992;
      (8)   As of December 2000, there have been 10,687 reported cases of AIDS
in the State of Ohio;
      (9)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982,
and 45,200 through November, 1990;
      (10)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990;
      (11)   In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the
United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may
be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (12)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
      (13)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and in
part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the
owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities.
      (14)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view “adult”
oriented films;
      (15)   The findings noted in divisions (b)(1) through (14) raise
substantial governmental concerns;
      (16)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
      (17)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business
is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate
to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises
and activities occurring therein;
      (18)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters;
      (19)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments;
      (20)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases;
      (21)   In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is
desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who
are likely to be witnesses to such conduct;
      (22)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter;
      (23)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which
leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases;
      (24)   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of
the City will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

769.02   PURPOSE; INTENT.
   Short-term rentals are unique, semi-commercial operations that adapt a
residential environment into a lodging concept, limited in scope and operation.
The use is clearly of a commercial nature, but may at times be more in keeping
with a residential environment. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a
systematic set of requirements to ensure that such operations, if appropriate
for a residential or commercial area, shall not adversely impact adjacent uses
as a result of the commercial aspects of the structure and property.
Short term rentals shall be the subordinate to the principal use of a structure
as a single-family dwelling. The intent of this chapter is not to provide an
opportunity for the establishment of an intensive commercial lodging business,
which would be considered appropriate within an intensive commercial or planned
commercial zoning district, but rather in certain locations to provide a
limited commercial use in a residential or commercial district.

automatically voided by operation of law without further notice or hearing upon
the sale or transfer of the real property upon which the short-term rental is
located.

application to occupy or use the public right-of-way based on the health,
safety and welfare of the city and in accordance with City ordinances and Ohio
law. These reasons may include but not be limited to those criteria set forth
in Section
777.02(d) of this chapter.
         B.   If the City denies a person’s application to occupy or use the
public right-of-way, the City shall provide its reasons in writing for denying
the application, and shall provide any information that the person may
reasonably request necessary for the person to obtain the city’s consent to

      (4)   The City’s grant of consent for a person to occupy or use the
public right-of-way shall be in the form of a right-of-way occupancy
certificate which shall set forth the specific terms of the city's consent for
such person to occupy or use the public right-of-way.
      (5)   Each person submitting an application for consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way shall pay a fee in the amount of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per site and assessed by the Director of Public Service to
reimburse the City for its administrative costs.
      (6)   A person seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more
than one small cell facility or one wireless support structure may file a
consolidated application for consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way
for up to thirty small cell facilities in a single application or up to thirty
wireless support structure requests in a single application. Said single
application may only address multiple small cell facilities or multiple
wireless support structures if they each involve substantially the same type of
small cell facilities or substantially the same type of wireless support
structures. The city may separately address small cell facilities or wireless
support structures for which incomplete information has been received or which
are denied. In the case of a single application, each small cell facility or
wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified or collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent to occupy or
use the public right-of-way for purposes of tolling the response deadline set
forth in this chapter.
      (7)   The time periods set forth herein may be tolled:
         A.   By mutual agreement between the person requesting consent and the
City;
         B.   Where the City determines that the application is incomplete; or
         C.   By the City in the event it receives applications for at least
twenty-five small cell facilities or wireless support structures contained in
pending requests, in which case the City may toll the ninety-day period for up
to twenty-one days.
      (8)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the City shall provide
written notice to the person requesting consent not later than thirty days
after receiving the request, clearly and specifically delineating all missing
documents or information.
      (9)   The time period resumes when the person makes a supplemental
submission in response to the City’s notice of incompleteness.
      (10)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the City shall notify
the person not later than ten days after receiving the supplemental submission
that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in
the original notice delineating missing documents or information. The time
period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices under the
procedures identified in divisions (7)A. to (7)C. of this Section.
   (d)   Small Cell Facility in Public Right-of-Way. No person shall occupy or
use the public right-of-way as a small cell facility on a wireless support
structure without first obtaining the approval of the proposed improvements by
the Planning Commission. Street lights and other potential support structures
are typically not present within the rights-of-way of local residential
streets. The addition of small cell facilities and wireless support structures
in front of residences would be detrimental to the aesthetic character of
neighborhoods particularly in areas where no other similar infrastructure
exists in the right-of-way and are strongly discouraged. The person proposing
the improvements shall deliver to the Planning Commission ten sets of the plans
and specifications including all necessary details, profiles, and cross-
sections for each proposed improvement. The Planning Commission shall approve
or disapprove of such proposed improvements based on the following standards:
      (1)   Compliance with all City codes and laws and other governmental laws
where required;
      (2)   The recommendation of all administrative departments in regard to
the improvements;
      (3)   The effect of the proposed improvements on the right-of-way and in
relation to all other improvements already installed or approved;
      (4)   The proposed location of the improvements in regard to such items
as sight lines, drainage, safety, and visual interference;
      (5)   The size, bulk, and location of the improvements in relation to
obtaining proper light, air, privacy, usable open space, and compatibility with
surrounding uses;
      (6)   The proper screening or placement of the improvements to minimize
the negative effects of the improvements on the right-of-way or adjoining uses;
      (7)   Compliance with the United States Department of Transportation
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and Ohio Department of
Transportation Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (OMUTCD).

person;
         B.   One million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence, two million
dollars ($2,000,000.00) annual aggregate, for property damage resulting from
any one accident; and
         C.   One million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence, two million
dollars ($2,000,000.00) annual aggregate, for all other types of liability.
      (2)   The liability insurance policies required by this Section shall be
maintained by the service provider throughout the period of time during which
the service provider is occupying or using the public right-of-way, or is
engaged in the removal of its facilities. Each such insurance policy shall
contain the following endorsement:
         “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after
receipt by the City, by registered mail, of a written notice addressed to the
Building Commissioner of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
      (3)   Within thirty days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in
no event later than fifteen days prior to said cancellation, the service
provider shall obtain and furnish to the City replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this Section.
      (4)   All insurance policies required herein shall be written with an
insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Ohio in relation to
the specific type of insurance required.
      (5)   Upon written application to, and written approval by, the Director
of Finance of the City, a service provider may be self-insured to provide all
of the same coverages as listed in this Section. As part of the review process,
the Director of Finance may require, and the self-insurance applicant shall
provide, any and all financial documents necessary to make a valid
determination of the applicant’s ability to meet the needs of this Chapter.
   (f)   General Indemnification. Each application for consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way shall include, to the extent permitted by law, the
service provider’s express undertaking to defend, indemnify and hold the City
and its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, agents,
representatives and subcontractors harmless from and against any and all
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the service provider or its affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the design, construction,
reconstruction, installation, operation, maintenance, repair or removal of its
small cell facility and wireless support structure, and In providing or
offering services over the small cell facility and wireless support structure,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this
Chapter.
   (g)   Surety bond or equivalent financial tool for cost of removal. All
owners must procure and provide to the City a bond, or must provide proof of an
equivalent financial mechanism, to ensure compliance with all provisions of
this section. The bond or equivalent financial method must specifically cover
the cost of removal of unused or abandoned small cell facilities or damage to
City property caused by an operator or its agent of each small cell facility
which the owner installs in the right-of-way in case the City has to remove or
pay for removal of the wireless facility. Two acceptable alternatives to a bond
include a funds set-aside and a letter of credit.

permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent

installation of any city or other public improvement in or upon the public
right-of-way.

Structure. Within thirty days following written notice from the City, any
service provider or other person that owns, controls or maintains any
unauthorized small cell facility, wireless support structure or related
appurtenances in the public right-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove the
small cell facility, wireless support structure or appurtenances from the
public right-of-way of the City. After the thirty days have expired, the City
may remove the small cell facility, wireless support structure or appurtenances
from the public right-of-way at the other party’s expense. A small cell
facility and wireless support structure is unauthorized and subject to removal
in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the service provider’s consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way;
      (2)   Upon abandonment of a small cell facility and wireless support
structure in the public right-of-way of the City;

constructed, reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained, or any
excavation of a public right-of-way was performed, without prior issuance of a

construction permit.

Support Structure. The City retains the right and privilege to cut or move any

need to protect the public health, safety or welfare.

twenty-four hours advance notice to the City, obtaining consent to occupy or
use the public right-of-way pursuant to Section
777.02 , if required.
   (b)   Routine Maintenance and New Service Orders.

service provider to cause a lane obstruction in a public street for more than
two hours, the service provider shall provide the City with forty-eight hours
advance written notice prior to commencing the routine maintenance or new
service order, and shall submit a drawing showing the planned traffic
maintenance and indicating how the service provider will meet all requirements
of ODOT’s Manual of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable governmental
regulations.
   (c)   Emergency Work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
emergency work, a service provider may commence such emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for emergency work that
requires excavation of a public right-of-way or lane obstruction or closing of
a public street, the service provider shall notify the City as promptly as
possible before commencing such emergency work, or as soon as possible
thereafter if advance notice is not practicable. When notice is required, the

905.01   CONSIDERATION IN THE ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued to any applicant for the construction of
a new building on any parcel of land in the Municipality unless the plan
includes a provision to construct or repair sidewalks when the parcel of land
upon which it is proposed to build has no sidewalks or has sidewalks which, in
the opinion of the Director of Public Service, are in need of reconstruction.
(Ord. 1956-75. Passed 10-22-56.)
905.02   WIDTH OF SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks which are constructed in and upon dedicated streets in the
Municipality shall not be less than five feet in width except that they shall
be constructed to conform in width to existing sidewalks in those portions of
streets where some sidewalks have already been constructed.
(Ord. 1956-38. Passed 5-14-56.)
905.03   CONFORMATION RULES.
   The conformation of newly constructed sidewalks with those which have
already been installed shall be obtained according to the following rules:
   (a)   Where a sidewalk is to be constructed throughout the width of an
existing lot or sublot, or other parcel of land regardless of the length of the
newly constructed walk, it shall be constructed as to its width to conform
exactly to the width of the existing walks at the termini thereof, provided the
widths of existing walks at each terminus of the newly constructed walk are the
same and are at least five feet wide at these terminal points.
   (b)   Where a sidewalk is to be constructed throughout the width of an
existing lot or sublot or other parcel of land and the existing sidewalks at
either terminus of such newly constructed walk are of different widths, the
newly constructed sidewalk shall be built to conform to the wider existing
walk, but in any event it shall be built not less than five feet in width and
shall taper gradually to any narrower walk at either terminus, beginning not
less than fifteen feet from such terminus and having the reduction of width on
the curb side.
   (c)   Where a sidewalk is to be constructed throughout the width of an
existing lot, sublot or other parcel of land and the walk is to be less than
sixty feet in length, and the existing sidewalks at either terminus of the
newly constructed walk are the same width but less than five feet wide, the
newly constructed sidewalk shall be constructed in width to conform exactly to
the width of the existing walks at the termini thereof.
   (d)   Where a sidewalk is to be constructed throughout the width of an
existing lot, sublot or other parcel of land and the walk is to be less than
sixty feet in length and the existing sidewalks at each terminus of the newly
constructed walk are of different widths, the newly constructed sidewalk shall
be constructed in width to conform to the width of the wider of the two
existing sidewalks and shall taper gradually to the narrower walk at its
terminus, beginning not less than fifteen feet from such terminus and, with the
reduction in width, taking place entirely on the curb side of the newly
constructed sidewalks.
(Ord. 1956-38. Passed 5-14-56.)
905.04   CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   All sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete and shall meet the following
minimum specifications:
   (a)   Cement. The cement used in concrete shall be Portland cement of a well
known brand and shall be subject to testing by the Director of Public Service
in accordance with Standard Methods of Sampling and Testing (Designation C 77-
37) of the American Society for Testing Materials. All cement used shall have a
specific gravity of not less than 3.1 and a residue by weight of not more than
eight percent on a No. 100 sieve or twenty-five percent on a No. 200 sieve. All
Portland cement, when tested in neat briquettes, shall have a tensile strength
of at least 150 pounds per square inch after one hour set in air and twenty-
three hours set in water and at least 450 pounds per square inch after one day
set in air and six days set in water.
   (b)   Sand. The sand used for concrete shall be clean sharp lake or bank
sand containing less than six percent loam or other foreign substances and
shall be entirely free from clay, shale or vegetable matter. It shall be
uniformly graded from that which will pass a No. 4 sieve to a No. 100 sieve and
at least one-third of the material shall be retained upon a No. 30 sieve.
   (c)   Stone. The mineral aggregate shall be crushed limestone ranging from
one inch down to one-quarter inch designated in the State of Ohio Department of
Highways Construction and Material Specifications as No. 46 size. The limestone
shall have a specific gravity of not less than 2.5, a hardness of not less than
12 and a toughness of not less than 4, all determinations to be made according
to requirements of the American Society for Testing Materials. The limestone
must be machine-broken and screened into the specified sizes. All fragments
must be generally cubical in form, free from an excess of flat, thin fragments
and contain no shale, silt, clay or foreign substances.
   (d)   Mix. Concrete sidewalk shall be cast from a mixture of one part
Portland cement, two parts sand and three and one-half parts limestone, all
materials as specified above and only enough clean water to make the mix
plastic and workable. In mixing ingredients the proportions shall be determined
by volume. The concrete shall have a slump not greater than three inches nor
less than two inches when subjected to the Slump Test for Consistency in
accordance with the American Society for Testing Materials (Designation D 138-
32).
   (e)   Grading. The excavation of subgrade shall include removal of all
earth, loam, shale, rock, roots, briars and undergrowth. All spongy material
shall be removed. Fills are to be made with cinders or other material
acceptable to the Director of Public Service.
   (f)   Forms. Concrete shall be thoroughly mixed before being deposited in
clean steel or wooden forms adequately braced to prevent distortion from the
specified dimensions. All forms shall be of a size sufficient to produce a walk
of a minimum thickness or depth of four inches.
   (g)   Placing Concrete.
      (1)   The concrete shall be thoroughly tamped and consolidated so that
none of the stone appears on the surface. The forms must be kept clean and
shall be coated with a suitable oil before filling with concrete.
      (2)   Foundation beds shall be sprinkled immediately prior to depositing
the concrete.
      (3)   Concrete when mixed shall be rapidly deposited in the forms and any
concrete not in final position within thirty minutes after completion of the
mixing shall be discarded. Under no circumstances shall concrete be used that
has partially set, and the remixing of such materials is prohibited. The
concrete shall be deposited between bulkheads of a uniform thickness and to the
full depth and width of the walk, irregular or sloping surfaces shall be
avoided. The concrete after being placed shall be throughly compacted and
brought to the proper pitch and grade with a templet or straight edge.
      (4)   Immediately prior to the finishing of the surface, the walk shall
be cut into slabs not longer than six feet on any one side. The joints shall be
cut through the full thickness of the walk and the opening so made shall be
filled with clean, dry sand well rammed into place. The joints shall be formed
by a cutting tool or other means satisfactory to the Engineer. The markings in
the surface of the walk at these joints shall not be more than one-fourth inch
deep. All edges shall be rounded with an approved edging tool to a radius of
one-fourth inch.
   (h)   Surface Finish. The finishing of the walk shall immediately follow the
placing and compacting of the concrete. Unless otherwise ordered by the
Director of Public Service, a finish produced by rubbing with wood floats will
be required. The surface shall be free from depressions or inequalities. The
application of dry cement to hasten drying of the surface is prohibited.
   (i)   Curing and Protecting. In rainy weather the concrete shall be
protected as soon as it is finished. In hot or dry weather the contractor shall
keep the concrete wet. Sprinkling shall be begun as soon as the concrete is set
sufficiently to prevent pitting and shall be continued at such intervals as the
weather conditions may require or the Engineer may direct.
   (j)   Expansion Joints. Prepared strips of bitumen and fiber or mineral
aggregate shall be placed in concrete walks at intervals of at least twenty
feet, also at ends where the walk abuts curbing or other lateral walks and
along the building line where the walk is laid full width from the curb to the
building or other structures. Similar joints shall be placed around water meter
covers, gas boxes, hydrants, lamp standards or other fixed objects projecting
through the walk. All strips shall be one-fourth inch in thickness, except for
transverse joints when the temperature is below seventy degrees Fahrenheit, in
which event the strips shall be one-half inch in thickness. The top of the
strip shall be cut off flush with the top of the concrete.
(Ord. 1956-38. Passed 5-14-56.)

         A.   Subject to applicable Federal, State and local laws, regulations
and ordinances and the provisions of this Permit, a permittee may perform all
construction necessary for the operation of its telecommunications and/or other
utilities system. All construction and maintenance of any and all facilities
within streets incident to the permittee's system shall, regardless of who
performs the construction, be and remain the permittee's responsibility. The
permittee shall apply for, and obtain, all generally applicable permits
necessary for the construction or installation of any facilities, and for
excavating and laying any facilities, within the streets. The permittee shall
pay all applicable fees upon issuance of the requisite construction permits by
the City to the permittee.
         B.   Prior to beginning any construction, the permittee shall provide
the City with a construction schedule for work in the streets. When the
permittee's construction of facilities in the streets is completed, the
permittee shall provide the City with a map showing the location of the
installed facilities in the streets, as built, in detail, excluding proprietary
electronics. All as-builts shall be available at the permittee's local office
for inspection.
         C.   The permittee may, with the approval of the City, make
excavations in streets for any facility needed for the maintenance or extension
of the permittee's system. Prior to doing such work, the permittee shall apply
for, and obtain, generally applicable permits from the City, and give
appropriate notices to any other franchisees, licensees or permittees of the
City, or departments of the City, or other units of government owning or
maintaining pipes, wires, conduits or other facilities which may be affected by
the proposed excavation.
         D.   In the event that emergency repairs are necessary, the permittee
shall immediately notify the City of the need for such repairs. The permittee
may initiate such emergency repairs, and shall apply for appropriate permits
within twenty-four hours after discovery of the emergency. The permittee shall
comply with all applicable regulations of the City relating to such excavation
or construction, including the payment of permit or license fees.
      (2)   Location of Facilities.
         A.   Within forty-eight hours after any other franchisee, licensee or
permittee, or other person to which the City has granted permission to conduct
excavation activities, notifies a permittee of a proposed street excavation,
the permittee shall, at the permittee's expense:
            1.   Mark on the surface all of its locatable underground
facilities within the area of the proposed excavation;
            2.   Notify the excavator of any unlocatable underground facilities
in the area of the proposed excavation; or
            3.   Notify the excavator that the permittee does not have any
underground facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation.
         B.   In the event that all surfaces were accurately marked for
underground facilities as requested and the permittee's plant was cut or
damaged for whatever reason, then the entity responsible for causing such
damage shall be required to notify the permittee of such damage and pay for the
repair of the permittee's plant.
      (3)   Restoration of Streets.
         A.   Whenever a permittee disturbs the surface of any street for any
purpose, the permittee shall promptly restore the street to at least its prior
condition to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. When any opening is made by
a permittee in a hard surface pavement in any street, the permittee shall
promptly refill the opening and restore the surface to a condition satisfactory
to the City Engineer.
         B.   If the permittee excavates the surface of any street, the
permittee shall be responsible for restoration of the street and its surface
within the area affected by the excavation, in accordance with applicable
regulations of the City and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. The City
may, after providing notice and an opportunity to correct to the permittee,
refill and/or repave any opening made by the permittee in the street, and the
expense thereof shall be paid by the permittee. The City may, after providing
notice and an opportunity to correct to the permittee, remove and/or repair any
work done by the permittee which, in the determination of the City, is
inadequate. The cost thereof, including the costs of inspection and
supervision, shall be paid by the permittee. All excavations made by the
permittee in the streets shall be properly safeguarded for the prevention of
accidents. All of the permittee's work under this chapter and this section, in
particular, shall be done in strict compliance with all rules, regulations and
ordinances of the City.
      (4)   Maintenance and Workmanship.
         A.   A permittee's system shall be constructed and maintained in such
manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of
the City or County, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals,
structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the streets by, or
under, the authority of the City.
         B.   The permittee shall provide and use any equipment and appliances
necessary to control and carry the permittee's signals or other utilities so as
to prevent injury to the City's property or property belonging to any person.
The permittee, at its own expense, shall repair, renew, change and improve its
facilities as listed above in good repair, and safe and presentable condition.
      (5)   Acquisition of Facilities. Upon a permittee's acquisition of
facilities in any street in the City, or upon the addition or annexation to the
City of any area in which the permittee owns or operates any facility, the
permittee shall, at the City's request, submit to the City a statement
describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by franchise, permit,
license or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such
facilities to the extent the permittee has possession of such information. Such
facilities shall immediately be subject to the terms of this Permit.
      (6)   Reservation of City Street Rights. Nothing in this Permit shall
prevent the City or public utilities owned, maintained and/or operated by
public entities other than the City, from constructing sewers; grading, paving,
repairing and/or altering any street; laying down, repairing or removing water
mains; or constructing or establishing any other public work or improvement.
All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, so as not to obstruct,
injure or prevent the use and operation of the permittee's system. However, if
any of the permittee's system interferes with the construction or repair of any
street or public improvement, including construction, repair or removal of a
sewer or water main, such portion of the permittee's system shall be removed or
replaced in the manner the City shall reasonably direct, and the City shall in
no event be liable for any damage to any portion of the permittee's system. Any
and all such removal or replacement shall be at the expense of the permittee.
Should the permittee fail to remove, adjust or relocate its facilities by the
date established by the written notice of the City to the permittee, the City
may effect such removal, adjustment or relocation, and the reasonable expense
thereof shall be paid by the permittee, including all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the City due to the permittee's delay.
      (7)   Street Vacation. If any street or portion thereof used by the
permittee is vacated by the City during the term of its permit, unless the City
specifically reserves to the permittee the right to continue its installation
in the vacated street, the permittee shall, without delay or expense to the
City, remove or discontinue its use of its facilities from such street, and
restore, repair or reconstruct the street where such removal has occurred, and
replace the street in the condition found. In the event of the failure, neglect
or refusal of the permittee, after a time period to be negotiated by the City
and the permittee, to restore, repair or reconstruct such street, the City may
do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost thereof may be collected by
the City from the performance bond of the permittee, if any.
      (8)   Discontinuing Use of Facilities. Whenever a permittee intends to
discontinue using any facility within the streets, the permittee shall submit
for the City's approval a complete description of the facility and the date on
which the permittee intends to discontinue using the facility. The permittee
may remove the facility or request that the City permit it to remain in place.
Notwithstanding the permittee's request that any such facility remain in place,
the City may require the permittee to remove the facility from above the street
or modify the facility to protect the public health, welfare, safety, and
convenience, or otherwise serve the public interest. The City may require the
permittee to perform a combination of modification and removal of any such
above-ground facility. The permittee shall complete such removal or
modification in accordance with a schedule set by the City, and shall restore
the area to a condition satisfactory to the City. Until such time as the
permittee removes or modifies the facility as directed by the City, or until
the rights to and responsibility for the facility are accepted by another
person having authority to construct and maintain such facility, the permittee
shall be responsible for all necessary repairs and relocations of the facility,
as well as maintenance of the street, in the same manner and degree as if the
facility were in active use, and the permittee shall retain all liability for
such facility.
      (9)   Hazardous Substances.
         A.   A permittee shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and
local laws, statutes, regulations, and orders, including, but not limited to,

substances has occurred, or may occur, from or related to the permittee's
system. In removing or modifying the permittee's facilities as provided in this
Permit, the permittee shall also remove all residue of hazardous substances
related thereto.
         C.   The permittee agrees to forever indemnify the City against any
claims, costs and expenses, of any kind, nature or description, whether direct
or indirect, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the City arising
out of the release of hazardous substances caused by the permittee's system.
      (10)   Undergrounding of Cable. A permittee's existing facilities and
existing portions of the permittee's system shall be placed underground at the

lawful for the permittee to make all needed excavations in the streets for the
purpose of placing, erecting, laying, maintaining, repairing, and removing
poles, conduits, supports for wires and conductors, and any other facility
needed for the maintenance or extension of the permittee's system as the City
may, in its discretion, approve. All poles of the permittee shall be erected
between the curb and the sidewalk unless otherwise designated by the proper
authorities of the City, and each pole shall be set whenever practicable at an
extension lot line. The City shall have the right to require the permittee to
change the location of any permittee-owned pole, conduit, structure or other
facility within the streets when, in the opinion of the City, the public
convenience requires such change, and the expense thereof shall be paid by the
permittee.

         F.   The permittee shall at all times employ professional care and
shall install and maintain in use methods and devices to prevent failures and
accidents which risk damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
      (27)   Cable Service to New Residential Developments. In new residential
developments in which all the electric power and telephone utilities are
underground, the following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and
utilization of underground easements:
         A.   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying
all franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire (or,
pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter and any franchise
agreement, may be required) to provide cable service to that development. The
developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator
responses. The final development map shall indicate the cable operators that
have agreed to serve the development.
         B.   If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall
be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared
basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall
provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate
to the City any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled
to recover the pro-rata cost of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event
that the City subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any other
cable operator.
         C.   The developer shall provide at least ten working days notice of
the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have
agreed to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators
shall have two working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five
working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
         D.   The final development map shall not be approved until the
developer submits evidence that:
            1.   It has notified each cable operator that underground utility
trenches are to open as of an estimated date, and that each cable operator will
be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to
individual homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and
conditions; and
            2.   It has received a written notification from each cable
operator that the cable operator intends to install its facilities during the
open trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms
and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the developer and the cable
operator, or has received no reply from a cable operator within ten days after
its notification to such cable operator, in which case the cable operator will
be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its facilities during the
open trench period.
         E.   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with any applicable State regulatory agency and utility standards. If such
compliance is not possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for
the cable television cables, with the entire cost shared among the
participating cable operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the
affected utilities and the cable operators, alternative installation
procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to
applicable law.
         F.   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches
have been closed and existing conduit has been utilized to capacity shall be
responsible for its own trenching, as approved by the City, and associated
costs, and shall repair all property to the condition which existed prior to
such trenching or burial, to the satisfaction of the City.
         G.   The City reserves the right to require clustering of pedestals
with other utilities, licensees, permittees or franchisees.

least forty-five days advance notice (or notice as soon as possible in cases of
emergency) of street improvements or other activity which could affect the
permittee's system, including, but not limited to, street or public rights-of-
way excavation, construction, repair, grading, traffic conditions, installation
of sewers, drains or water pipes, power or signal lines, tracks or vacation or
improvement of public works.
         A.   All such public works shall be done, insofar as possible, in such
a manner as not to obstruct, injure, or prevent the free use and operation of
the poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of the
permittee's system. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person or entity
from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
interfering with the permittee's system facilities while performing the public
works.
         B.   If any equipment of the permittee shall interfere with public
works, then, upon receipt of the notice, that part of the equipment of the
permittee which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the permittee in
such manner as shall be directed by the City so that the same shall not
interfere with the public works as reasonably determined by the City, and the
permittee shall bear the reasonable expense of such removal or replacement.
      (29)   Notice. Except in the case of an emergency involving public safety
or service interruption to a large number of subscribers, the permittee shall
give reasonable notice to the property owners or legal tenants prior to
entering upon any private premises, and said notice shall specify the work to
be performed. If any damage is caused by any permittee activity or omission,
the permittee shall reimburse the property owner the reasonable cost of the
damage or replace the damaged property. For installation of pedestals or other
major construction or installation projects, property owners shall also be
notified by mail at least one week in advance. In the case of an emergency (as
defined above), the permittee shall attempt to contact the property owner or
legal tenant in person, and shall leave a door hanger notice in the event
personal contact is not made. Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing
access or entry to private property or any other property where such right to
access or entry is not otherwise provided by law.

applicable sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as
amended, as well as all other applicable Federal, State and local laws and
regulations.
         D.   All installation of electronic equipment shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of the National Electrical and Safety Code and
the National Electrical Code, as the same may, from time to time, be amended.
         E.   Antennas and their supporting structures (towers) shall be
painted, lighted, erected and maintained in accordance with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration and all other
applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations.
         F.   All of the permittee's plant and equipment, including, but not
limited to, the antenna site, headend and distribution system, towers, house
connections, structures, poles, wire, coaxial cable, fiber strands, electronic
equipment, amplification equipment, optic equipment, transmission and
distribution structures, lines, termination equipment, pipes, sewers, mains,
tubing, conduits, innerducts, regenerators, repeaters, underground lines,

fixtures and appurtenances, used for the telecommunications and/or other
utilities system, shall be installed, located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained and operated in
accordance with good engineering practices, performed by experienced
maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger or interfere with
improvements that the City may deem appropriate to make or to interfere in any
manner with the rights of any property owner, or to unnecessarily hinder or
obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
         G.   The permittee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall
install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing
failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to
the public.
      (31)   Trimming of Trees.
         A.   The permittee shall have the authority to trim trees, at its sole
cost, in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions and ordinance and
easement restrictions, upon and hanging over streets, alleys, sidewalks, and
public places of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from
coming in contact with the wires and cables of the permittee. City
representatives shall have authority to supervise and approve all trimming of
trees conducted by the permittee.
         B.   Except in emergencies, the permittee may not prune trees at a
point below thirty feet above sidewalk grade until one week after written
notice has been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the
street in or over which the tree is growing. For purposes of this section,
emergencies exist when it is necessary to prune to protect the public from
imminent danger of immediate interruption of cable signal. The owner or
occupant shall have seven days from the receipt of the permittee's notice to
arrange for an outside contractor to prune the tree, at his or her own expense.
If the owner or occupant fails to do so, the permittee may prune such tree at
its own expense.
      (32)   Use of Facilities by City. The City shall have the right to
install and maintain, free of charge, upon the poles and within the underground
pipes and conduits of the permittee, any wires and fixtures desired by the
City, to the extent that such installation and maintenance do not unreasonably
interfere with existing operations of the permittee and are in accordance with
other governmental regulations.
(Ord. 2000-4. Passed 2-14-00.)
911.06   ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATION.
   (a)   Authority. The City expressly reserves, and the permittee expressly
recognizes, the City's right and duty to adopt, from time to time, in addition
to the provisions herein contained, such Charter provisions, resolutions,
ordinances and rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary by the City in
the lawful exercise of its police power for the protection of the health,
safety and welfare of its citizens and their properties. The Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of the City, as the same may be amended from time to time,
are expressly incorporated, as if fully set out herein, by this reference. The
permittee shall comply with all Charter provisions, resolutions, ordinances,
rules and regulations of the City and shall obtain all required permits. All
permittees who are also franchisees under a cable television franchise granted
by the City shall further comply with all requirements contained in the cable
franchise agreement and the master cable television regulatory ordinance. Any
failure of the permittee to comply with the requirements of the City described
herein shall constitute an evasion of obligations under this Permit, and shall
be prohibited. The City reserves the right to delegate any of its rights or
obligations under this Permit, without the consent of the permittee, to any
person, organization or official.
   (b)   Coordination and Environmental Impact. Except for emergencies, the
City may require that all construction and installations be coordinated with
the City's street improvement programs. In addition, the permittee shall assess
and report on the impact of its proposed construction on the City environment.
Such reports may be reviewed by the City to ensure, inter alia, (i) that all
applicable laws, including building and zoning codes and air and water
pollution regulations, are complied with, (ii) that aesthetic and good planning
principles have been given due consideration, and (iii) that adverse impact on
the environment has been minimized. The permittee shall incorporate reasonable
changes requested by the City.
   (c)   Construction and Restoration. All streets, public property, and
lawfully installed improvements therein which are distributed by the
permittee's activity shall be restored to the City's satisfaction in the time
frame prescribed by the City, or if not prescribed by the City, as soon as
possible (in no circumstances more than thirty days from the date of completion
of construction) by the permittee, at its expense, to, at a minimum, the
condition which existed prior to construction to, the satisfaction of the City.
In the event replacement and restoration of the area is not completed within
thirty days or as soon as reasonably possible, the City may, upon written
notice to the permittee, complete any necessary work at the sole expense of the
permittee.
   (d)   Undergrounding. Except where noted in the Exhibits attached to
original Ordinance 200-4, passed February 14, 2000, and expressly made a part
hereof by reference, and specifically authorized by the City prior to
construction, all of the permittee's facilities shall be installed underground
and all installation of street crossings shall be made by boring. The permittee
shall make no open cuts without specific prior written permission of the City
Engineer or his or her designee. Additionally, any facilities not installed
underground must be expressly authorized beforehand by the City in writing, and
so located that any interference with the other uses of the streets and other
public properties, and any interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners whose property adjoins any of the streets and
other public properties, are minimal. No underground installation shall be made
in any public right-of-way without having first obtained a street cut or other
permit from the City and complying with the City's bonding requirements.
   (e)   Alternative Burial Standards. In cases where the burial standards of
Section
911.05(24) do not apply, the minimum burial depth for the permittee's
underground facilities shall be two feet, or such other depth as approved by
the City, with warning tape buried above all fiber optic cable, conduit or
lines to reduce the potential for accidental breakage and to minimize actions
under the hold harmless provision of Section
911.08(a).
(Ord. 2000-4. Passed 2-14-00.)
911.07   REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   (a)   Open Records. The permittee shall manage all of its operations in
accordance with a policy of keeping its records open and accessible to the
City. The City shall have access to, and the right to inspect at all reasonable
times, any books and records of the permittee and affiliated entities which are
reasonably related to the administration or enforcement of the terms of this
Permit. The permittee shall not deny the City access to any of the permittee's
records on the basis that the permittee's records are under the control of any
parent company, affiliated entity or a third party. The City may also, in
writing, request copies of any such records or books and the permittee shall
provide such copies within thirty days of the transmittal of such request, at
the sole expense of the permittee. If the requested books and records are too
voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied or removed, then the
permittee may request, in writing, within ten days, that the City inspect them
at the permittee's local offices. If any books or records of the permittee are
not kept in a local metropolitan office and copies are not made available to
the City upon written request as set forth above, and if the City determines
that an examination of such records is necessary or appropriate to the
performance of any of the City's duties, audits, administration or enforcement
of this Permit, then all reasonable travel and maintenance expense(s) incurred
in making such examination shall be paid by the permittee. The requirements of
this section shall be in addition to any other similar sections contained in
other ordinances that affect the permittee.
   (b)   Confidentiality. The City agrees to treat as confidential any books or
records that constitute proprietary or confidential information under Federal
or State law, to the extent the permittee makes the City aware of such
confidentiality. The permittee shall be responsible for clearly and
conspicuously stamping the word “Confidential” on each page that contains
confidential or proprietary information, and shall provide a brief written
explanation why such information should be treated as confidential under State
or Federal law. If the City receives a demand from any person for disclosure of
any information designated by the permittee as confidential, the City shall, so
far as consistent with applicable law, advise the permittee and provide the
permittee with a copy of any written request by the party demanding access to
such information within a reasonable time. Nothing herein shall alter the
City's obligation to comply with the Ohio Open Records Act, as the same may,
from time to time, be amended.
   (c)   Public Filings.
      (1)   The permittee shall notify the Director of Public Service and
provide a copy, upon his or her request, of all FCC, Federal and State reports
and filings on behalf of the permittee or its affiliates which relate to the
operation of the system.
      (2)   All information furnished to the City that is not subject to
confidential treatment under subsection (b) hereof is public information, and
shall be treated as such.
   (d)   Annual Reports. Within 120 days after the close of the permittee's
fiscal year, the permittee shall submit to the City a written annual report, in
a form acceptable to the City, which shall include, but not necessarily be
limited to, the following information for the permit area:
      (1)   An expense statement certified by an officer of the permittee;
      (2)   A summary of the previous year's activities in development of the
system, including, but not limited to, services begun or discontinued during
the reporting year, and the number of users of the permittee's services;
      (3)   A statement of planned construction, if any, for the next two
years;
      (4)   A list of the permittee's officers, members of its Board of
Directors, and other principals of the permittee; and
      (5)   A list of stockholders, or other equity investors holding five
percent or more of the voting interest in the permittee and its parent,
subsidiary and affiliated corporations and other entities, if any, unless the
parent is a public corporation whose annual reports are publicly available, in
which case a copy of the annual report shall be submitted.
   (e)   Plant Survey Report. At the City's request, including, but not limited
to, requests based on customer complaints or the City's own experience with the
facilities, the permittee shall submit to the City, within thirty days of the
request, unless such time is extended by the City, a plant survey report, which
shall be a survey of the permittee's plant within all or portions of the permit
area as specified by the City, and a full report thereon. Said report shall
include, but not be limited to, an appropriate engineering evaluation of the
telecommunications and/or other utility system, including, but not limited to,
any suitable electronic measurements conducted in conformity with such
requirements, including supervision, as the City may prescribe. Said report
shall be in sufficient detail to enable the City to ascertain that the same
meet service requirements and all applicable Federal, State and local
construction, operational and technical performance standards. At the City's
request, but not more than once per year, the permittee and the City shall
agree upon the appointment of an independent engineer to evaluate and verify
the performance of the system. Subject to the prior appropriation of funds
therefor, the cost of the evaluation shall be borne equally by the permittee
and the City, unless the independent engineer determines that the system fails
to meet applicable standards, in which case the permittee shall reimburse the
City for all costs of the evaluation.
   (f)   Failure to Report. The failure or neglect of the permittee to file any
of the reports or filings required under this Permit, or such other reports as
the City may reasonably request, may, at the City's option, be deemed a breach
of this Permit.
   (g)   False Statements. Any intentional false or misleading statement or
representation in any report required by this Permit may be deemed a breach of
this Permit and may subject the permittee to all remedies, legal or equitable,
which are available to the City under this Permit or otherwise.
(Ord. 2000-4. Passed 2-14-00.)
911.08   INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
   (a)   Indemnification.
      (1)   The permittee shall construct, maintain and operate its facilities
in a manner which provides protection against injury or damage to persons or
property. The permittee, for itself and its related entities, agents, employees
and subcontractors, and the agents and employees of said subcontractors, shall
save the City harmless, defend and indemnify the City, its successors, assigns,
officers, employees, agents and appointed and elected officials, from and
against all liability or damage and all claims or demands whatsoever in nature,
and reimburse the City for all its reasonable expenses, including attorney
fees, as incurred, arising out of the installation and operation of the
permittee's system within the streets and rights-of-way, including, but not
limited to, the actions of the permittee, its employees, agents, contractors,
related entities, successors and assigns, or the securing of and the exercise
by the permittee of the permit rights granted in this Permit, including any
third party claims, administrative hearings, actions for copyright infringement
and litigation, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed, or prohibited by this Permit. The terms of each contract awarded by
the permittee for activities pursuant to this Permit shall contain indemnity
provisions whereby the contractor shall indemnify the City to the same extent
as described above.
      (2)   The permittee shall pay, and by its acceptance of this Permit
agrees to pay, all actual expenses incurred by the City in defending itself
with regard to all damages and penalties arising in any way out of the exercise
of any rights granted hereunder. In the event the City institutes litigation
against the permittee for a breach of this Permit or for an interpretation of
this Permit, and the City is the prevailing party, the permittee shall
reimburse the City for all costs related thereto, including reasonable attorney
fees.
   (b)   Notice. Within thirty days after receipt of the same by the Law
Director, the City will provide notice to the permittee of the assertion of any
claim or action arising out of the exercise by the permittee of its Permit
rights. The permittee will be permitted, at its own expense, to appear and
defend or assist in the defense of such claims. The permittee shall have no
recourse whatsoever against the City for or on account of any loss, cost,
expense or damage arising out of the provisions or requirements of this Permit,
or the grant of the permit.
   (c)   Certificate of Insurance.
      (1)   At the time of the execution of this Permit, and annually
thereafter, the permittee shall provide to the City, in accordance with the
provisions hereof, a certificate of insurance. The permittee shall maintain
public liability and property damage insurance that protects the permittee and
the City, its officers, agents, employees and appointed and elected officials,
from any and all claims for damages or personal injury, including death, and
demands, actions and suits brought against any of them arising from operations
under this Permit or in connection therewith, in accordance with the
subsections below. Coverage during construction shall include those hazards
normally identified as X.C.U. This insurance coverage constitutes a minimum
requirement and shall in no way be deemed to lessen or limit the liability of
the permittee, related entities, its successors or assigns, under the terms of
this revocable Permit.
      (2)   The certificate of insurance shall be with a company licensed to do
business in the State of Ohio with a rating by Best of not less than “A”. This
liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection
against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property,
resulting from the permittee's automobiles, products and operations. The
insurance shall provide coverage at all times for not less than five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) for bodily injury to any one person and one million
dollars ($1,000,000) bodily injury in the aggregate per single accident or
occurrence and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for damage to any
single property, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) for property damage in
the aggregate per single accident or occurrence, plus costs of defense, or in
such other amounts as are acceptable to the City and as provide substantially
equivalent coverage. The following endorsements shall attach to the liability
policy:
         A.   The policy shall cover personal injury as well as bodily injury.
         B.   The policy shall cover blanket contractual liability, subject to
the standard universal exclusions of contractual liability included in the
carrier's standard endorsement as to bodily injuries, personal injuries and
property damage.
         C.   Broad form property damage liability shall be afforded.
         D.   The City and its elected officials, officers, agents and
employees shall be named as additional insureds on the policy. Notwithstanding
the naming of additional insureds, the insurance shall protect each insured in
the same manner as though a separate policy had been issued to each, but
nothing herein shall operate to increase the insurer's liability as set forth
elsewhere in the policy beyond the amount or amounts for which the insurer
would have been liable if only one person or interest had been named as
insured. The coverage must apply as to claims between insureds on the policy.
         E.   Standard form of cross-liability shall be afforded.
         F.   An endorsement shall be provided which states that the policy
shall not be canceled or materially altered so as to be out of compliance with
the requirements of this section, without thirty days written notice of such
cancellation or alteration given to the City.
      (3)   If the insurance is canceled or materially altered so as to be out
of compliance with the requirements of this section, the permittee shall
provide a replacement policy. The permittee agrees to maintain continuous
uninterrupted insurance coverage in the amounts required.
      (4)   The City reserves the right to adjust the coverage limit
requirement upward in the event the statutory maximums applicable to local
governments are raised and that such increased coverage limit requirements are
equally applied to all other permittees of the City.
      (5)   Any deductible or self-insured retention must be declared to the
City.
      (6)   The permittee shall submit to and maintain on file with the City
documentation of the required insurance, including a certificate of insurance
signed by the insurance agent and companies named, as well as all properly
executed endorsements. Said certificate shall be subject to the approval of the
City as to the adequacy of the certificate and of the insurance certified under
the requirements of this section.
      (7)   Failure of the permittee to maintain adequate insurance as required
under this section shall be cause for immediate termination of the permit by
the City.
      (8)   Nothing herein shall be in any way construed as a waiver on behalf
of the City of any of the protections or provisions of the Ohio Governmental
Immunity Act, and the permittee shall ensure that in naming the City as an
insured under this section, all insurance policies or agreements shall
specifically contain a non-waiver provision and shall not impair said
protection and provisions.
   (d)   Security.
      (1)   With respect to the initial construction of the telecommunications
and/or other utility system, or any significant project to upgrade or rebuild
more than fifty percent of the telecommunications and/or other utility system,
the permittee shall provide to the City a construction performance and
construction completion bond (hereinafter referred to as the “construction
completion bond”) with a surety reasonably approved by the City's Law Director,
in an amount equal to ten percent of the applicable estimated construction
cost. Such amount shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000).
With respect to the initial construction of the telecommunications and/or other
utility system or the upgrade or rebuild project, when regular subscriber
service is available to seventy-five percent of occupied dwelling units, the
amount of the bond shall be reduced by fifty percent of the original amount. On
the one-year anniversary of the initial construction of the telecommunications
and/or other utility system or the upgrade or rebuild project, as the case may
be, the bond may be canceled.
      (2)   The permittee shall also deposit with the City a surety bond or
letter of credit in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Law Director of the City (hereinafter referred to
as the “performance bond”). The performance bond shall be available to insure
the faithful performance by the permittee of provisions of the permit, other
than with respect to construction, upgrading or rebuilding projects covered
herein, but including the obligation to remove the telecommunications and/or
other utility system upon revocation or termination of the permit as set forth
herein. The performance bond shall be maintained at fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) during the entire term of this Permit, regardless of withdrawals
which may be made under this section. In the event of a default by the
permittee in any of its obligations under this Permit, other than completion of
construction, which default is not cured within thirty days after notice by the
City to the permittee of such default (or such longer time as is necessary to
cure, so long as the permittee commences to cure within thirty days and
diligently pursues cure), the City may levy on the performance bond upon
notifying the permittee of the amount of such charge. The rights reserved to
the City with respect to the performance bond are in addition to all other
rights of the City, at law or in equity.
(Ord. 2000-4. Passed 2-14-00.)
911.09   REMOVAL OF FACILITIES; TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TO CITY.

telecommunications and/or other utility system, and an assignment of this
Permit or grant of a new Permit, within a reasonable period of time, but in no
event more than ninety days after such termination, then the permittee shall
remove said telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities at the
permittee's expense. As an alternative to removal, the permittee may, subject
to the City's approval, abandon its facilities in place and transfer ownership
of the installed telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities to the
City. Nothing herein shall cause the City to incur any costs related to the
removal of the permittee's facilities or the transfer of ownership of said
facilities to the City. (Ord. 2000-4. Passed 2-14-00.)
911.10   ASSIGNMENT OF PERMIT AND LEASE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   City's Consent Required for Assignment. The permittee shall not assign
this Permit or any rights or obligations accorded the permittee hereunder to
any party without the prior written consent of the City, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Further, the permittee agrees not to assign any
billing or collection functions under this Permit to a subsidiary or parent
without prior written notice to and written consent from the City, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should the permittee attempt to
assign this Permit or its rights hereunder without the prior consent of the
City, this Permit shall be subject to forfeiture or termination as provided
herein, unless such assignment is ratified by the City for any and all costs
incurred, including attorney fees, resulting from any such attempt to assign
this Permit, in whole or part. A refusal by the City to approve an assignment
of this Permit or the permittee's rights hereunder shall be deemed reasonable,
among other things, and without limitation, if and insofar as it relates to any
requirement or condition of the City that the proposed assignee cure any
existing default of the permittee hereunder and/or to any demonstration of the
assignee's qualifications equivalent to demonstrations of the permittee's
qualifications required hereunder, including, but not limited to, the technical
and financial strength and operating experience of the assignee.
   (b)   Lessee to Obtain Permit. The permittee shall not lease any of its
telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities, system capacity system
bandwidth or use of the streets, and rights-of-way in which such are contained,
to any persons or other entities providing telecommunications and/or other
utility services, without first ensuring that such persons have obtained a
revocable permit and other required permits or franchises from the City for the
provision of such services, and without the prior written consent of the City.

911.11   PERMIT REVOCATION.
   (a)   Permit Revocable. A permit hereby granted shall be revocable at any
time that the Council shall determine that the public convenience and necessity
or the public health, safety or general welfare requires such revocation, or

right to revoke the same is hereby expressly reserved to the City. However, at
a reasonable time prior to Council action upon such revocation or proposed
revocation, opportunity shall be afforded to the permittee, its successors and
assigns, to be present at a hearing to be conducted by the Council upon such
matters and thereafter to present its or their views and opinions thereof and
to present for consideration, actions or actions alternative to the revocation
of this Permit.
   (b)   Continued Obligations. The revocation of this Permit, for any reason,
shall not operate as a waiver or release of the permittee from any obligation
or any liability which arose or arises out of any act or failure to act
required under this Permit prior to termination.
(Ord. 2000-4. Passed 2-14-00.)
911.12   EQUAL OPPORTUNITY; SAFETY.
   (a)   Nondiscrimination. In all matters connected with this Permit, the
permittee shall not discriminate against any employee, subcontractor, customer,
client, or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, age, sex,
national origin, or handicap. The permittee shall adhere to acceptable
affirmative action guidelines in selecting employees, subcontractors, and
customers, and shall ensure that the employees, subcontractors, and customers

permittee's system is not in compliance with applicable standards or
requirements and so notifies the permittee, then the permittee shall
immediately take appropriate remedial action and continue such action without
interruption until the system is in compliance.
(Ord. 2000-4. Passed 2-14-00.)
911.14   EMERGENCY USE OF FACILITIES.
   The permittee shall, in the case of any City, State, or national emergency

period.

from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from firefighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City to be
significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Cuyahoga County
Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in
accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Cuyahoga
County Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health
nuisance by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. Discharges from new or
replacement off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after January

operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operator's
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated by the City to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility's owner/operator at the written or oral request of the City and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a facility
subject to this chapter for the purposes of illicit discharge inspection is a
violation of this chapter.
      (6)   If the City is refused access to any part of the facility from
which storm water is discharged, and the City demonstrates probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program designed
to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the City may seek issuance of a
search warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief,
and/or criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
(Ord. 2015-38. Passed 10-26-15.)
935.09   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. When the City finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the City may order
compliance by written notice of violation. Such notice must specify the
violation and shall be hand delivered, and/or sent by registered mail, to the
owner/operator of the facility. Such notice may require the following actions:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit discharges or illegal connections;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; or
      (5)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice of violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a notice of violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the notice of violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing. If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, the City
shall schedule an administrative hearing to determine reasons for non-
compliance and to determine the next enforcement activity. Notice of the
administrative hearing shall be hand delivered and/or sent registered mail.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
chapter pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3709.211. If a owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the City may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/operator from
activities that would create further violations or compelling the owner/
operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
(Ord. 2015-38. Passed 10-26-15.)

the person's own expense, or interment or cremation when the body of an
indigent person is claimed by an indigent person. The purpose of this policy is

or designee, and receipt of an invoice or bill for the burial. The City shall

by the amount of funds received from any other source. If additional funds are
paid to the funeral director or funeral home after the City has paid as herein
provided, the City shall be refunded the exact amount of the additional funds
paid to the funeral director or funeral home within 30 days of the receipt
thereof. The funeral director shall submit a notarized statement to the Mayor,

maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and groundwater recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.

1106.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; to meet the requirements of the
Construction General Permit; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated SCMs that address degradation of water resources. The
SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the water resources receiving stormwater
discharges from the site. Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with
Chapter 1107.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable. Where feasible, bioretention, permeable
pavement with infiltration, underground storage with infiltration, infiltration
trenches, infiltration basins, and/or rainwater harvesting must be the water
quality SCMs used. Separate SCMs may be used for peak discharge control and
water quality treatment.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City of Parma Heights and Ohio EPA.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post- construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in
Chapter 1103 - Subdivision Regulations, shall provide stormwater management and
water quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall
include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding
during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable,
the predevelopment runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1106.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1105 Erosion and Sediment Control,
Chapter 1107 Riparian Setbacks, and
Chapter 1108 Wetland Setbacks, all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of two (2) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1106.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCM, or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by SCMs defined in
a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Parma Heights,
SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City of Parma Heights. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed
on these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property
owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
the, existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent practicable.
Such practices may include minimizing site grading and compaction; protecting
and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing vegetation and
vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in order to
minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation of tree
preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices; and
maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
      (10)   Post-Construction Soil Restoration: Except for areas that will be
covered by impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil
moisture-holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be
restored to that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent
practicable. Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer
removed should be amended using the soil profile restoration design criteria in
Rainwater and Land Development.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1106.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1105 Erosion and Sediment Control,
Chapter 1107 Riparian Setbacks, and
Chapter 1108 Wetland Setbacks, all as determined by the City Engineer. At a
minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities, or the stormwater
quality control facility shall be sized to treat the off-site flow.
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved until it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site runoff will
be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner that does not
exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. The sheet flow
length shall not exceed 75 feet from impervious area or 150 feet from pervious
areas. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other SCMs
from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined
by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City of Parma Heights zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City Engineer.
The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when
necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers capacity and hydraulic grade line shall be designed
in accordance with the current version of UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR SEWARGE
IMPROVEMENTS unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Parma Heights:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold-
water habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high-
watermark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one (1) foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least two feet below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Parma
Heights must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Parma Heights, reductions
in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries
of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCMs that meet or exceed the criteria in the Construction
General Permit.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydro logic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, and time
of concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Use the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States,
NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3) for rainfall depth data for stormwater design.
            6.   Use the SCS Type II rainfall distribution for all design
events with a recurrence interval greater than 1 year. Include lot coverage
assumptions used for full build out of the proposed condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use prior to any development and not only the current
land use.
               a.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               b.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall use
post-construction hydrologic soil groups from Rainwater and Land Development
unless the soil is amended using the soil profile restoration design criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development. All undisturbed areas or open space with
amended soils shall be treated as "open space in good condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity-based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer Handbook
Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by runoff reduction SCMs may be
subtracted from the post-development stormwater volume. Volume reductions for
these SCMs may be demonstrated using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land
Development or a hydrologic model acceptable to the City Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems. From the volume determined in Section
1106.09(D)(3)(a), determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or greater than Less than
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or greater than Less than
--                       10                       1 year
10                       20                       2 year
20                       50                       5 year
50                       100                      10 year

250                      500                      50 year
500                      --                       100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
         C.   The minimum storage volume for the storm water quantity control
system shall be calculated following the requirements of subsections (d)(1)
through (3) above. However, in no case shall the required storage volume be
less that the total proposed hard surface area times two (2) inches unless
approved by the City Engineer. Hard surface areas shall include roof areas,
concrete areas, asphalt areas, brick areas, stone pavers, and other similar
areas as determined by the City Engineer.
         D.   An access manhole or inspection port as approved by the City
Engineer shall be provided at each end of an underground storage facility for
sufficient inspection, maintenance, and discovery of the system from the
surface.
   (e)   Storm water Management for Previously Developed Areas.
      (1)   SCMs on previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the
Construction General Permit.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.10   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   When the City of Parma Heights determines that site constraints compromise
the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in
an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the Construction General Permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the on-site controls required under this regulation. The City
Engineer may require proof of Ohio EPA review and approval for any alternative
action proposed.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.11   EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the City Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City of Parma Heights prior to
approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga County Fiscal
Office and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the City Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an additional 25-foot-
wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to SCMs shall be restricted against the construction therein
of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may obstruct the free
flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and
against the changing of final grade from that described by the final grading
plan approved by the City of Parma Heights. Any re-grading and/or obstruction
placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the City of Parma
Heights at the property owners' expense.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.12   MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
City Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the City Engineer and per the
approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as designed and installed,
meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan approved
by the City Engineer. In evaluating this certification, the City Engineer may
require the submission of a new set of SCM calculations if he/she determines
that the design was altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plan. The As-Built Survey must provide the location,
dimensions, and bearing of such SCMs and include the entity responsible for
long-term maintenance as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance Plan
and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement as specified in Section
1106.08 must be provided to the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.13   ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection
and Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The City of
Parma Heights has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct
inspections as necessary, with prior notification of the property owner, to
verify that the SCMs are being maintained and operated in accordance with this
regulation. Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair,
the City of Parma Heights shall provide written notification to the responsible
party, as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for
maintenance. Upon notification, the responsible party shall have ten (10)
working days, or other mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or submit a
plan with detailed action items and established timelines. Should repairs not
be made within this time, or a plan approved by the City Engineer for these
repairs not in place, the City of Parma Heights may undertake the necessary
repairs and assess the responsible party.
   (b)   At least one (1) inspection with a written inspection report shall be
performed each year for all required SCMs, whether installed before or after
adoption of this code. Inspections shall be performed by qualified personnel
according to standards acceptable to the City Engineer. The written report
shall be submitted to the City Engineer by May 1 of each and every year after
the SCM is installed unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer in an
Inspection and Maintenance Plan & Agreement.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.14   FEES.
   The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the City
of Parma Heights before the review process begins. The City Engineer shall
establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing
these services.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.15   BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 10% of the total project cost, or other amount determined by the City
Engineer, has been deposited with the City of Parma Heights Finance Department.
This bond shall be posted for the City of Parma Heights to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less City of Parma Heights
administrative fees as detailed in the City of Parma Heights Codified
Ordinances, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   The site has been stabilized, temporary BMPs have been removed, and
the sediment settling basin has been converted to or replaced with post-
construction SCM(s) and one of the following conditions are met:
         A.   100% of the total project has achieved permanent stabilization.
         B.   Less than one (1) acre of lots remain unbuilt.
         C.   No development activities have occurred for one (1) year.
      (2)   An As-Built Certification of all SCMs is approved by the City
Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the City of
Parma Heights and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by the
developer, the contractor, the City of Parma Heights, and the private owner or
homeowners' association who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs,
is accepted by the City Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the City of Parma Heights may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues
with all stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the
bond shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the
purpose of long-term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.16   INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the City Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the final
grade at the site, after all the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the City Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these SCMs, all disturbed areas
and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must be
stabilized within two (2) days.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.17   VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated any of
the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted
under this regulation.
(Ord. 2023-78. Passed 1-8-24.)
1106.18   APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other
action or inaction by the City of Parma Heights in relation to this regulation

provision of this regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and
shall be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for no
more than sixty (60) days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall
be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City of Parma Heights instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a Court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful
development, or to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to require

   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within the City of Parma Heights contributes to the
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the City of Parma
Heights. The specific purpose and intent of this regulation is to regulate uses
and developments within riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of
riparian areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody debris
from fallen or damaged trees, streambank erosion, and the downstream transport
of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the City of Parma Heights by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
gabion baskets and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and
threats to the safety of watershed residents; and by contributing to the scenic
beauty and environment of the City of Parma Heights, and thereby preserving the
character of the City of Parma Heights, the quality of life of the residents of
the City of Parma Heights, and corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect and enhance these
functions of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a riparian setback along designated watercourses in
the City of Parma Heights.

provisions of law, regulation, contract, or deed, or the legal remedies
available thereunder, except as provided in Section
1107.03(a) of this regulation.
   (c)   If any clause, section, or provision of this regulation is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected thereby.

(Ord. 2023-79. Ord. 1-8-24.)
1107.10   VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may grant a variance to this regulation as
provided herein. In granting a variance, the following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect
to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining
the riparian setback as established in this regulation, such as to justify the
granting of a variance, the Planning Commission shall consider the potential
harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a proposed
structure or use.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may not authorize any structure or use in a
Zoning District other than those authorized in the Zoning Code.
      (3)   Variances shall be void if not implemented within one (1) year of
the date of issuance.
   (b)   In making a determination under Section
1107.10(a) of this regulation, the Planning Commission may consider the
following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
Chapter 1385 Flood Damage Reduction may be used as guidance when granting
variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this regulation, placed on the landowner by this
regulation and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or
use.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion
and control sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the City of Parma Heights. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or
concrete paving in the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel
driveways when necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
City of Parma Heights, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation.
   (c)   In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Planning Commission may consider granting variances to other
area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the Zoning Code. These
may include, but are not limited to, parking requirements, requirements for the
shape, size, or design of buildings, or front, rear, or side lot setbacks.
   (d)   In granting a variance under this regulation, the Planning Commission,
for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems appropriate to
maintain the purposes of this regulation and to mitigate any necessary impacts
in the riparian setbacks permitted by variance. In determining appropriate
mitigation, the Planning Commission may consult with the City of Parma Heights
Engineer or other agencies including Cuyahoga SWCD.

   (a)   It is hereby determined that the wetlands within the City of Parma
Heights contribute to the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents
of the City of Parma Heights. The specific purpose and intent of this
regulation is to regulate uses and developments within wetland setbacks that
would impair the ability of wetlands to:
      (1)   Minimize flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the
velocity of flood waters, regulating stream base flows, and maintaining stream
flow patterns.
      (2)   Minimize streambank erosion by reducing runoff volume and velocity.
      (3)   Protect groundwater quality by filtering pollutants from storm
water runoff.
      (4)   Recharge groundwater reserves.
      (5)   Protect surface water quality by minimizing sediment pollution from
streambank erosion, and filtering, settling, and transforming sediments,
chemicals, salts, and other pollutants from flood waters and storm water
runoff.
      (6)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic and terrestrial
wildlife.
      (7)   Benefit the City of Parma Heights economically by minimizing
encroachment on wetlands and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
retention/detention basins and rip rap to protect structures and reduce
property damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents; and by
contributing to the scenic beauty and environment of the City of Parma Heights,
and thereby preserving the character of the City of Parma Heights, the quality
of life of the residents of the City of Parma Heights, and corresponding
property values.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect these services of
wetlands by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses within
wetland setbacks around Ohio EPA Category 2 and 3 wetlands in the City of Parma
Heights.
      Due to the importance of properly functioning wetlands, minimum wetland
setbacks may be given preference over minimum front, side, or rear yard
setbacks as specified in this chapter in the consideration of an appeal for a
variance by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

provided herein. In granting a variance, the following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect
to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining
the wetland setback as established in this regulation, such as to justify the

highest quality wetlands in the State of Ohio and should be protected to the
greatest extent possible.

control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the

variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent possible and
to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion and control
sediment.

such as maintained lawns, in the wetland setback compromises its benefits to
the City of Parma Heights. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or
concrete paving in the wetland setback. Variances may be granted for gravel
driveways when necessary.
      (7)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
City of Parma Heights, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation.
      (8)   In order to maintain the wetland setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Planning Commission may consider granting variations to other
area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the Zoning Code.
      (9)   In granting a variance under this regulation, the Planning
Commission, for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems
appropriate to maintain the purposes of this regulation as outlined in Section

1325.01 et seq.
1135.01   CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT REQUIRED.
   When a proposed use is permitted in a zoning district as a conditional use
as set forth in the district regulations or in Section
1135.03, a conditional use permit is required and the application for such
conditional use permit shall be submitted and reviewed according to the
following review procedures.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.02   DESIGNATION AS A CONDITIONAL USE.
   (a)   Certain types of uses are classified as conditional uses because of
their uncommon or unique characteristics, infrequency of occurrence, large area
requirements, or potential for significant impact on a particular district.
Consequently, the conditional use procedures call for a more flexible and
equitable procedure for properly accommodating such activities in the
community. The forces that influence decisions regarding the nature, magnitude
and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied,
depending upon functional characteristics, competitive situations, and the
availability of land. The purpose of this section is to provide controllable
and reasonably flexible requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow
practicable latitude for the investor, but that will, at the same time,
maintain adequate provisions for the health, safety, convenience and general
welfare of the City's inhabitants.
   (b)   In order to accomplish such a dual objective, this chapter sets forth
a review procedure that enables a more detailed consideration of each
conditional use. The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning
and land use in the vicinity of the proposed use; the design, size, operation,
processes and equipment employed, and intensity of the proposed use; the
impacts of the proposed use at the proposed location on the public health,
safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare, including traffic
generation and movement, the amount and kinds of public facilities and services
required; and whether and to what extent all appropriate feasible steps have
been taken by the permit applicant to minimize or mitigate any adverse impacts
of the proposed use.
   (c)   Review of this information by the Planning Commission is required to
ensure that each proposed conditional use is consistent with the intent and
objectives of the particular district in which it is to be located.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.03   USES CLASSIFIED AS CONDITIONAL USES IN ALL DISTRICTS.
   In addition to uses specifically listed in a particular district as
conditional uses, uses that may be authorized as a conditional use in any
district pursuant to this chapter include churches, schools, municipal
buildings, playgrounds and parks, public utilities and such other uses of a
public or civic nature.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.04   CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the Planning
Commission on a form prescribed by the Commission, accompanied by an
application fee as established by City Council.
   (a)   The application for a conditional use permit shall include the
following items:
      (1)   A development plan and associated documentation as required in
Section
1133.09.
      (2)   A description of all uses proposed for the development, the
location, extent and characteristics.
      (3)   A statement or diagram showing compliance with any use-specific
requirements specified in
Chapter 1195.
      (4)   Any other material and/or information as may be required by the
Planning Commission or Council to fulfill the purposes of this section of the
Zoning Code and to ensure that the application is in compliance generally with
the ordinances of Parma Heights.
   (b)   The Chief Building Official may waive certain submittal requirements
in order to reduce the burden on the petitioner and to tailor the requirements
to the information necessary to review a particular petition. The Chief
Building Official may waive such requirements upon finding that the project
size, complexity, anticipated impacts, or other factors associated with the
proposed development clearly, in his or her opinion, support such waiver. Any
such waivers shall be authorized in writing and retained in the project file.
   (c)   Copies of the application shall be distributed by the Planning
Commission to the Departments of Public Safety and Public Service.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.05   PUBLIC HEARING AND REVIEW BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   No later than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing on the
application, each department to which the application has been referred shall
file a written report thereon with the Planning Commission setting forth the
recommendations for changes in the proposed use as submitted and conditions for
approval, if any, necessary to bring such proposed use into compliance with any
applicable ordinance.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall hold one public hearing to review and
consider the application. The public hearing shall be scheduled within 45 days
following acceptance of a complete application and after the notice required by
law has been provided.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall review the proposed conditional use as
presented on the submitted plans and specifications and consider the written
reports and public comments made during the public hearing, to determine:
      (1)   Whether the proposed use is appropriate and in keeping with the
purpose and intent of this Planning and Zoning Code;
      (2)   Whether the development plan for the proposed conditional use
complies with the development plan review criteria set forth in Section
1133.10, as applicable;
      (3)   Whether the establishment and operation of the proposed use
complies with the general criteria established for all conditional uses in
Section
1135.08 and any specific requirements established for that particular use set
forth in
Chapter 1195, Use-Specific Standards in this Planning and Zoning Code and any
additional requirements in the Parma Heights Codified Ordinances pertaining to
the proposed use, such as but not limited to the Business Code.
   (d)   The Planning Commission may require additional plans and documents
further clarifying the nature and extent of the use or any aspect of the
application.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.06   DECISION.
   (a)   Within 30 days following the public hearing on the application, unless
an extension of this time is agreed to by the applicant, the Planning

permit shall include a statement of the reasons for the denial.
      (3)   Failure of the Planning Commission to act within the time, or an
extended period as may be agreed upon, shall at the election of the applicant
be deemed a denial of the application.
   (b)   If the Planning Commission approves the application, the Commission
shall, within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the public hearing,
transmit the application to the City Council for the Council's confirmation.
   (c)   Confirmation by City Council. City Council shall: confirm the decision
with or without modifications or conditions; refer the application back to the

Council subject to conditions, the grantee shall, in writing within ten days
following such Council action, acknowledge such approval and unconditionally
accept and agree to such conditions.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.07   GENERAL CRITERIA FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following criteria. Furthermore,
the Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of
each proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence that:

accordance with the purpose, intent and basic planning objectives of this
Planning and Zoning Code and with the objectives for the district in which
located;
   (b)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare;

maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will
not essentially change the character of the same area;
   (d)   The proposed building or use will not result in the destruction, loss,
or damage of any feature determined by the Planning Commission to be of
significant natural, scenic, or historic importance;
   (e)   The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district;
   (f)   The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;
   (g)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location will
not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
   (h)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided;
   (i)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public

the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police, fire and
schools;

that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted by
right that may be incompatible;

Chapter 1191.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.08   TERMS AND DURATION OF APPROVAL.
   (a)   Conditional use approval shall authorize a particular conditional use
on the specific parcel for which it was approved. Approval of a conditional
use, pursuant to this chapter, shall be valid only for the use and the
operation of such use as specified when granted by the Planning Commission. The
breach of any condition, safeguard, or requirement shall constitute a violation
of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)   A conditional use permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
valid only to the applicant to whom the permit is issued, unless the new owner
agrees to all conditions, safeguards and requirements in the conditional use
permit and a transfer of such permit is approved by the Chief Building

   (c)   The conditional use approval shall expire six months from the date of
enactment, unless:
      (1)   In the case of new construction, work upon the structure shall have
begun above the foundation walls;
      (2)   In the case of occupancy of land, the use has commenced;
      (3)   As otherwise specifically approved by the Planning Commission at
the time the conditional use approval is granted; or

shown, upon the request of the applicant.

the Planning Commission of any violations, and the Planning Commission may then
recommend to City Council that it revoke the conditional use permit.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 1-25-21.)
1135.10   SIMILAR USES.
   Within each zoning district established by the Planning and Zoning Code and
amendments thereto, uses of land or structures, which are compatible with each
other, are permitted in the district. To the extent that new types of uses are
created and are not addressed by this Planning and Zoning Code, this section
provides the procedure by which the Planning Commission may make a
determination that a new use is similar to a use permitted in a district.
   (a)   Determination. A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use is in compliance with
the following provisions:
      (1)   The proposed use is not prohibited in any other district;
      (2)   The proposed use is not listed as a permitted building or use in
any other district;
      (3)   The proposed use conforms to and is consistent with the purpose
statement of the proposed district more appropriately than in any other
district;
      (4)   The proposed use is of the same general character as the permitted
uses in the district to which it is proposed or is similar to a specific use
permitted in that district.
   (b)   Assignment to Districts. If the Planning Commission approves the
proposed similar use, then the similar use shall be added to those districts
that allow the principal or conditional use that is most similar, as determined
by the Planning Commission.

1141.01   INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the rights of property owners who
lawfully established, and have continuously maintained in a lawful manner, a
use, structure or lot which, due to the adoption of or amendment to this Code,
is no longer permitted. Such legal nonconforming use, structure or lot shall
continue to operate under the provision of law under which the nonconforming
use, structure or lot was recognized so long as the nonconforming use,
structure or lot is not in violation of such provision of law, the adoption of
this chapter notwithstanding.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the voluntary compliance with any
future ordinance, regulation, or incentive.
   (b)   The regulations of this chapter are intended to restrict further
investments that would make nonconformities more permanent in their location in
inappropriate districts as well as to afford opportunities for creative use and
reuse of those other nonconformities that contribute to a neighborhood and are
consistent with the goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   A nonconforming use may be nonconforming either by virtue of
characteristics of the physical structure that fail to comply with applicable
legal standards, or due to a use of the structure that fails to comply with
applicable land use restrictions.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.02   LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   A nonconforming use, structure or lot does not include nonconformity
with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a zoning
regulation.
   (b)   Ordinary repairs, repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
   (c)   No change may be made to a nonconforming use or structure without
review and authorization by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless the use of such
building or structure is changed to a conforming use.
   (d)   Such authorization shall be issued only if the Board finds, after a
public hearing, that the proposed change, extension or alteration is no more
harmful or objectionable than the current nonconforming use or structure and
only if the estimated cost of the proposed change, extension or alteration does
not exceed 25 percent of the assessed value of the building or structure.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.03   BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   No change shall be required by this Zoning Code in the plans, construction
or designated uses of a building or structure which does not conform to the
regulations of this Zoning Code for the district in which its premises are
located, provided a building permit was issued and construction on such
building or structure was begun before the effective date of this Zoning Code
or amendment thereto and completed within six months thereof. For the purposes
of this Zoning Code such construction shall be deemed an existing nonconforming
use.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.04   NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Any use lawfully existing prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Code (Ordinance 1953-29, passed June 1, 1953) or any use within a district
changed by amendment to this Zoning Code may be allowed or continued although
the use does not conform to the new regulations of the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Expansion of Use. No nonconforming use of a building, structure or
land shall hereafter be expanded, enlarged or increased in intensity, provided
however that a nonconforming use may be extended throughout those parts of the
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use prior to the
effective date of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 1953-29, passed June 1, 1953) or
to the enactment of subsequent amendments to this Zoning Code if no structural
alterations except those required by law or ordinance are made therein.
   (c)   Change in Use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use may be changed to a use conforming with the
regulations established for the district in which the nonconforming use is
located, provided, however, that a nonconforming use so changed shall not in
the future be changed back to a nonconforming use.
      (2)   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use,
provided the Board of Zoning Appeals determines that the new use is more
consistent with the spirit of the Zoning Code, the neighborhood, and the City's
Master Plan.
      (3)   A change in ownership or occupancy of the same use shall not in
itself constitute a change in use.
   (d)   Moving. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part
to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (e)   Damage or Destruction. When a building or structure occupied by a
nonconforming use is damaged, destroyed or removed by more than 50 percent of
its replacement value, by whatever cause, such building or structure shall not
be reconstructed, restored or replaced, except by a conforming building,
structure or use.
   (f)   Abandonment. A nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned when
the intent of the owner to discontinue the use for at least six months is
apparent, when the use has been replaced by a conforming use or when the
characteristic equipment and furnishings of the nonconforming use of a
building, structure or premises has been changed to a more restricted use.
      (1)   Intent to resume operation or use shall not affect this provision.
      (2)   Reuse of such land or building shall thereafter conform to all
regulations for the district, and any nonconforming use shall not be resumed.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.05   NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure occupied by a use permitted in the zoning district
in which it is located exists on the effective date of adoption or amendment of
any provision of the Zoning Code that could not be built under the terms of
said provision by reason of restrictions on size, height, setbacks, or lot
coverage, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, and in compliance with the following:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure shall be enlarged, altered, or
reconstructed in a way that increases its nonconformity, except as otherwise
provided below.
   (b)   Structural alterations of a building or structure that is
nonconforming solely because of its encroachment in a required setback area may
be extended in any lawful manner that does not further encroach in that
setback.
   (c)   A nonconforming building or structure that is damaged, destroyed or
removed by more than 50 percent of its replacement value, by whatever cause,
shall not be reconstructed, restored or replaced, except by a conforming
building or structure.
   (d)   If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due
to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.06   NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building or use existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Code, or an
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not comply with
off-street parking regulations for the district or use in which it is located
may continue without such parking facilities. In the event an existing building
is altered or a use is changed or substituted in accordance with these
regulations, then additional off-street parking spaces shall be provided for
the expansion as required in Section
1187.06.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.07   NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Planning and Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which fails to conform to
the sign regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming
sign. Nonconforming signs shall comply with the regulations set forth in
Section
1383.30, Nonconforming Signs.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.08   NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of any provision of
this Zoning Code, which does not meet the requirements of said provision, shall
be considered buildable provided that the site plan meets all setback
requirements established by the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)
1141.09   EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of a
zoning amendment, is listed as a conditional use in the district in which it is
located, shall be deemed without further action to be a conforming use. Any
change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such use, site development
conditions or signs, or change in ownership shall only be permitted upon review
and approval by the Planning Commission according to the procedures for
conditional uses set forth in
Chapter 1135.
(Ord. 2021-4. Passed 1-25-21.)

1184.01   INTENT.
   In recognition of the special nature of the needs of elderly persons, it is
necessary to establish a zoning district specifically for elderly living and
care where elderly person's needs, whatever level of attention they may
require, can be met ranging from minimal care in independent living units,
through personal intermediate and skilled nursing care.
   A Senior Citizen Residential District (SCRD) and regulations therefor are
established in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To provide appropriate developments of dwelling facilities for persons
of retirement age in locations convenient to the City's social and welfare
facilities, shops, public transportation and other needs of the senior citizen;
   (b)   To provide in such developments health, dining and recreational
facilities for the comfort and convenience of the occupants;
   (c)   To regulate the bulk, height and spacing of buildings within the
development in order to obtain proper light, air, privacy and open space for
passive recreation and landscaped amenities;
   (d)   To protect adjacent residential properties by requiring adequate yards
and screening; and
   (e)   To regulate the density of population within such district.
(Ord. 2014-30. Passed 10-14-14; Ord. 2018-6. Passed 2-12-18.)
1184.02   ELDERLY DEFINED.
   As used in this chapter, “elderly person” means persons who are at least 55
years of age in compliance with the Housing for Older Person Act of 1995,
unless such persons fall within the following exception:
   (a)   A handicapped or infirm adult over age 18 whose disability requires
the special amenities and services of a senior citizen complex.
(Ord. 2014-30. Passed 10-14-14; Ord. 2018-6. Passed 2-12-18.)
1184.03   PERMITTED USES.
   In a Senior Citizen Residential District (SCRD) land and buildings shall be
used, and buildings shall be designed, erected, altered or maintained, in whole
or in part, only for the following purposes:
   (a)   Any use or accessory use permitted and regulated in Class A, Class A-
2 or Class B; and
   (b)   A senior citizen center, which means a development or institution
providing dwelling facilities for three or more persons, principally of
retirement age, who may or may not be dependent upon the services of others and
who are not related to the owner or operator. Such senior citizen center must
include rest, nursing or other health facilities, as set forth in Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3721, and may include dining, recreational and other related facilities
and services.
      (1)   Main uses, which shall be restricted primarily for occupants and/or
employees, are as follows:
         A.   Dwelling facilities, such as apartments, row houses and other
attached multi-family or detached dwellings;
         B.   Elderly care health facilities primarily for the use of the
occupants;
         C.   Dining facilities primarily for occupants and/or employees;
         D.   Recreational facilitates primarily for occupant; and
         E.   Administrative offices.

         B.   Off-street parking and garages as regulated in this chapter; and
         C.   Related facilities and services.
(Ord. 2014-30. Passed 10-14-14; Ord. 2018-6. Passed 2-12-18.)
1184.04   DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA.
   (a)   A project for this age group should be designed specially for this
purpose, incorporating necessary safety and convenience features. In general,
the site amenities provided should be more attractive than for multi-family
projects, since the elderly people spend nearly all their time on the site. The
yards and passive recreation areas should be extensive in quantity and fully
landscaped. There should be a composition of small, intimate, private yard and
court areas for a variety of passive activities.
   (b)   Safety must be emphasized. Vehicular circulation drives shall be only
at the perimeter of the project. Parking areas may penetrate into the perimeter
of the site. The interior of the site shall be assigned completely to
pedestrian use. Abrupt grades shall be avoided, and all changes in grades in
the walk system shall be accomplished by ramps. There shall not be more than
two exterior steps to any buildings used by the occupants, and all buildings of
two or more stories measured from the main entrance shall be served by
elevators.

a minimum lot frontage of 100 feet, a minimum lot width at the building line of
200 feet. In addition, the total lot area shall not be less than a total of
2,178 square feet of lot area for each dwelling unit; or 20 units per acre.
      (2)   No building shall be erected, nor shall an existing building be
altered, which exceeds three stories in height.
      (3)   The ground floor area of all main and accessory buildings shall not
exceed 50% of the lot area.
   (b)   Single-Family Cluster Homes.
      (1)   Within any Senior Citizen Residential District (SCRD) one family
cluster unit may be arranged, or designed to be used in accordance with Section
1174.02.

1184.06   MAXIMUM DENSITY.
   (a)   For independent dwelling units, the density shall not exceed six units
per acre, except that the Planning Commission may approve a maximum density of
ten units per acre when the Senior Citizen Residential District (SCRD) is
adjacent to a nonresidential district or other location where the Senior
Citizen District is either isolated from or serves as a transitional
development to an abutting residential district.
   (b)   For congregate care and assisted living/nursing home facilities, the
density shall be governed by the maximum building height and maximum project
area coverage.
(Ord. 2014-30. Passed 10-14-14; Ord. 2018-6. Passed 2-12-18.)
1184.07   YARD REGULATIONS.

1185.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Mixed Use Districts is to encourage a compact mix of
uses, including retail, service, office, and housing, to coexist in a manner
that reflects human scale and emphasizes pedestrian orientation, taking
advantage of the existing density of Parma Heights, the convenience provided by
multimodal transportation options along Pearl Road and W. 130th Street, and the
vitality that mixed uses can bring to a community.
   These districts and associated regulations are intended to create and
enhance areas of concentrated development along Pearl Road and W. 130th Street
in order to:
   (a)   Promote a diverse mix of business, commercial, office, institutional,
educational, cultural, and entertainment activities in suitable locations for
workers, visitors, and residents.
   (b)   Promote integrated residential living environments that provide a
broad range of housing types for an array of housing needs and lifestyle
options.
   (c)   Encourage pedestrian-oriented development within walking distance of
transit opportunities at densities and intensities that will help to support
transit and contemporary businesses.
   (d)   Promote the health and well-being of residents by encouraging
development that fosters physical activity, alternative transportation, and
greater social interaction.
   (e)   Create a place that represents a unique, attractive, and memorable
destination for visitors and residents.
   (f)   Enhance the community's character through the promotion of high
quality urban design.
   (g)   Ensure that new development and redevelopment occurs in a unified
manner.
   (h)   Ensure the mixed use districts reflect the existing and desired
development along the Pearl Road and W. 130th Street commercial corridors,
based on the Comprehensive Plan, other planning documents and existing
development characteristics, as highlighted below:
      (1)   Town Center Mixed Use District (TC-MUD). The Town Center district
is primarily intended to encourage and enhance the desired high-intensity and
social function of the Town Center. The regulations support and build on the
Town Center's role as a hub for business, office, government, retail, culture,
entertainment and recreation. The district regulations support a mix of uses
and residential projects, which are an important component of the Town Center's
vitality, and promote connectivity to Greenbrier Commons civic center and Big
Creek Parkway.
      (2)   W. 130th Street Mixed Use District (W130-MUD). This district is
intended to foster a mixed-use environment that provides employment
opportunities located within walking distances of residents and the range of
compatible uses that are suitable for proximity to Southland Shopping Center, a
major regional destination and transit hub.
      (3)   Neighborhood Mixed Use District (N-MUD). This district is primarily
intended to accommodate moderate-density residential development and small-
scale commercial and office uses in locations between the larger, denser Town
Center and W. 130th Street Mixed Use Districts. Development is of a size and
intensity suitable for smaller lots and compatible with the residential
character of the adjacent neighborhoods.

permit for construction involving excavation, grading, drilling and hauling of
earth to or from the site of construction, or the hauling of material to or

that earth, debris, or material of any kind must be removed from the street,
tree lawn or sidewalk, to put the same in substantially the same condition as

provided for, refuse or neglect to remove the required material or repair the
sidewalk or curb or other public property required, then and in that event, the
Inspector shall cause the work to be done, which cost shall be charged against
the applicant, and the cost, so far as met by the deposit, shall be paid into
the Municipal Treasury for the use of the Service Fund and the balance of the
deposit as may remain after the deduction of the aforementioned cost shall be
refunded to the applicant as aforesaid, less the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00)
for the cost of inspection.
   (b)   A deposit of five dollars ($5.00) for each foot of sidewalk adjacent
to a highway, street, avenue or alley which is open to public use shall be
required to guarantee the construction of a sidewalk on any parcel of land upon
which none exists at the time application for a building permit is made. Upon
construction of the sidewalk to the satisfaction of the Director, this deposit
shall be returned less fifty dollars ($50.00) for each separate lot or land, to

commercial construction or other construction as deemed necessary by the
Director of Public Service. On every new building a cash deposit of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) and a mud bond of two hundred dollars ($200.00) are
required.
   For a group building of dwellings by one contractor, or for commercial
construction or any other type of construction, the amount of cash deposit
shall be set by the Director for a sum he or she deems adequate to protect the
interests of the City. All deposits shall be subject to increase if the nature
of the work warrant such an increase. When all construction work is completed,
when all temporary offices, tools and/or storage sheds are removed and when the
property involved has been restored to a reasonable state of orderliness, a
final inspection shall be made.
   Where work has been completely satisfactorily at the time of final
inspection, cash deposits will be refunded, with the exception of any charges
deemed necessary for extra inspections.

1381.01   PERMIT REQUIRED; FEE.
   At the time of applying for a permit to construct any building, or to make

a change in the grade of the yard, the applicant shall also apply for a yard
grading permit. This requirement to obtain a permit to change the grade of a
yard shall apply to all grade changes in all the various classifications of
property; provided, however, that no yard grading permit shall be required when
an application for a building permit is not to construct a new dwelling or a
new commercial building and when the Building Inspector determines that the

   The application for a yard grading permit shall be made on forms prescribed
by the Building Inspector.
   The fee for a yard grading permit shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) and
in addition thereto the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Municipal
Engineer in setting the new grade.
(Ord. 1989-32. Passed 8-14-89; Ord. 2002-53. Passed 11-25-02.)

with such single-family dwelling.
(Ord. 1989-32. Passed 8-14-89.)
1381.03    REGULATION OF GRADING.
   No person shall change the grade of any land within the Municipality without

shall have been required to and has obtained a permit pursuant to Sections
1381.01 and 1381.02. Application for such permit shall be made upon forms
prescribed by the Building Inspector and shall include a topographical map and
plans, specifications and profiles showing, among other things, the proposed
grading, its relationship to adjacent lands and any change in elevation which
will be caused by such grading.
   The fee for such application shall be the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Municipal Engineer in studying the application to determine its
feasibility. When, in the opinion of the Engineer, such grading will not result
in any backing, stagnation or overflow of water, thereby endangering the health
and safety of the residents of the community and the value of property situated
therein, the Inspector shall issue a permit authorizing such grading.
(Ord. 1989-32. Passed 8-14-89.)

misdemeanor of the second degree and shall be fined not more than seven hundred
fifty dollars ($750. 00) or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues. The owners of any lots abutting or adjoining the

1383.01   INTENT.
   (a)   Sign regulations, including provisions to control the type, design,
size, location, motion, illumination, enforcement and maintenance of signs are
established in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
      (1)   To maintain high value Residential Districts and promote attractive
public and private facilities by permitting only signs appropriate to their
environs;
      (2)   To provide reasonable but appropriate conditions for identifying
establishments in commercial districts by relating the size, type and design of
signs to the size and type of establishments;
      (3)   To eliminate any conflict between advertising signs and traffic
control signs which would be hazardous to the safety of the motoring public or
pedestrians;
      (4)   To control the design of signs so that their appearance will be
aesthetically harmonious with an overall urban design for the area; and
      (5)   To promote the most desirable developments and economic activity
consistent with the objectives of the planning and development of the City.
   (b)   (1)   In establishing these objectives the City has determined that,
without adequate regulation and design standards, signs are a nuisance. The
number of signs in the City is excessive and is unduly distracting to motorists
and pedestrians, creates a traffic hazard, and in some places reduces the
effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. As the appearance of the
City is marred by the excessive number, oversized and poorly designed signs,
both residential and business property values are adversely affected.
Therefore, the number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs
permitted should comply with the standards of this chapter in order to reduce
the aforementioned effects.
      (2)   In view of the foregoing, all signs not conforming with the
provisions of this chapter are hereby declared a nuisance. It is further
declared that the regulations contained in this chapter are the minimum
regulations necessary to abate the nuisance and to achieve the purposes of this
chapter.
   (c)   The City does not intend to infringe on the rights of free speech as
protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article
I Section 11 of the Ohio Constitution. All ordinances in this chapter are to be
construed in favor of vigorous political debate and the rights guaranteed to
speak freely.
(Ord. 2001-49. Passed 12-10-01.)
1383.02   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   Signs shall be designed, erected, altered, reconstructed, moved and
maintained, in whole or in part, in accordance with the type, design, size,
location, illumination and other requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   The construction, erection, safety and maintenance of all signs shall
be in accordance with applicable City codes. This chapter shall not amend or in
any way interfere with other codes, rules or regulations governing traffic
signs within the City.

(Ord. 2001-49. Passed 12-10-01.)
1383.30   NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   Generally. A sign conforming to the regulations prevailing on the
effective date of this chapter, but which does not conform with the regulations
of this chapter or a subsequent amendment thereto, shall be construed as a
legal nonconforming sign.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of this section, in addition to providing
specific standards for the design, construction and erection of every new
graphic, sign, marquee or canopy, is to cause every graphic or other sign in
violation of any provision of this chapter to be removed, altered or replaced
so as to conform with the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Maintenance. Nonconforming signs may be maintained and structural
parts repaired or restored to a safe condition, if required and if a permit
therefor has been issued.
   (d)   Authority to Continue Nonconformities. Any permanent graphic, sign,
marquee or canopy, as defined in Section
1383.03, other than a temporary sign, which is deemed to be a nonconformity,
which was erected pursuant to a City permit and in place on the effective date
of a provision of this chapter or any subsequent amendment thereto, may be
continued only in accordance with the following regulations:
      (1)   Repairs. Ordinary repairs and nonstructural alterations may be made
to a nonconforming sign. No structural alterations shall be made in, to or upon
such nonconforming sign, except those required by law to make the sign conform
to the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Additions and enlargements. A nonconforming sign shall not be added
to or enlarged in any manner.
      (3)   Moving. No nonconforming sign shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other location unless such sign and the use thereof are made to conform to
all requirements of this chapter.,
      (4)   Restoration of damaged nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign
which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other cause to the extent that the
cost of restoration will exceed 60% of the replacement cost of such sign, shall
not be restored unless it is made to conform to all the requirements of this
chapter, or any subsequent amendment thereto. In the event that such damage or
destruction is less than 60% of the replacement cost of such sign, no repairs
or construction shall be made unless restoration is started within three months
from the date of the partial destruction and is diligently pursued to
completion.
      (5)   Discontinuance of use of nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign,
the use of which is discontinued for a period of 30 days, shall thereafter
conform to the requirements of this chapter.
      (6)   Change of use of nonconforming signs. Where there is a change in
ownership or where the business, use or identity associated with the
nonconforming sign at the time of the adoption of this chapter thereafter
terminates or changes, such termination or change of use shall require
termination of any nonconforming sign, and the use of such sign shall
thereafter conform to the requirements of this chapter.
      (7)   When any sign associated with a business, use or identity is
altered, not including maintenance as defined in Section
1383.29, all nonconforming signs associated with the business, use or identity
must be brought into conformance.
   (e)   Engraved and Similar Signs. Any sign, graphic or numeral display
embossed, etched, engraved or otherwise an integral part of the original
building's masonry architecture, which was in existence prior to the effective
date of division (d) of this section, may be continued, provided that such
sign, graphic or numeral display is maintained as originally designed and
intended.
(Ord. 2001-49. Passed 12-10-01.)
1383.31   REMOVAL OF SIGNS ACCESSORY TO ABANDONED USES.
   Any sign accessory to an abandoned use shall be removed within 15 days of
notification by the Service Department, by certified mail, to remove the same.
Such notification shall be deemed sufficient if mailed to the last known
address of the owner of the property as shown on the records of the County
Recorder where the sign is located. A use shall be determined abandoned if it
has ceased operations for at least 90 consecutive days. Seasonal businesses are
exempt from this provision.
(Ord. 2001-49. Passed 12-10-01.)
1383.32   REMOVAL OR MAINTENANCE OF PERMANENT SIGNS AND NONCOMPLYING SIGNS.
   (a)   Whenever the removal or maintenance of any permanent sign has been
ordered by the Service Director, the owner of such a sign shall remove or
maintain such sign within 48 hours after receiving such notice. In the event of
noncompliance, the Service Director may remove or cause to be removed or
maintained such sign at the expense of the owner of such sign or the owner of
the property on whose premises it was erected, affixed or attached, and such
person shall be individually and separately liable for the expense incurred in
the removal of such sign.
   (b)   Portable or temporary signs in existence on the effective date of this
section which do not comply with this chapter, and all other signs heretofore
erected or displayed without legal authorization, shall be removed immediately
after the delivery by the Service Director of written notice to do so, to the
owner or occupant of the premises on which such signs are located. Notification
can be by personal delivery or by certified mail. Costs for sign removal, if
not paid for by the owner, will be added as an assessment to the tax duplicate.
   (c)   Signs, flags, banners, posters, pennants, ribbons, streamers, spinners
or other similar moving devices that are installed or erected must be removed
immediately upon written or verbal notification from the Service Department.
(Ord. 2001-49. Passed 12-10-01.)
1383.33   SIGN SPECIFICATION PLATES.
   All signs hereafter erected shall contain a two-inch by four-inch

1383.34   SIGNS AS A NUISANCE; INJUNCTION.
   (a)   A sign which is nonconforming on the effective date of this chapter,
which does not conform with the regulations of this chapter or a subsequent
amendment, shall constitute a nuisance, and the owner of the property on which
the sign is located shall be subject to a suit for injunctive relief as well as
prosecution for criminal violations.
   (b)   Any sign or other object placed, displayed, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered or permitted to remain on any premises in violation of
this chapter or the Building Code, and any sign heretofore erected, constructed
or displayed without legal authorization, is hereby declared to constitute a
nuisance, and in addition to any penalty provided in these Codified Ordinances
for such violation, the nuisance may be abated in the manner provided now or in
the future statutes of Ohio, in the manner provided in Chapter 634, or in the
manner provided in Section

(Ord. 2001-49. Passed 12-10-01.)
1383.35   SEVERABILITY.
   All sections and provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be
independent divisions and subdivisions and, notwithstanding any other evidence
of legislative intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative
intent that if any provisions of this chapter, or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remaining sections or
provisions and the application of such sections and provisions to any person or
circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that such sections and provisions
would have been passed independently of such section or provision so known to
be invalid.
(Ord. 2001-49. Passed 12-10-01.)
1383.36   VIOLATION; LEGAL AND EQUITABLE REMEDIES.

1385.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of Parma Heights, State of Ohio, does ordain these Flood Damage
Reduction regulations.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Parma Heights has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1385.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by Section
1385.27 Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 6281 Pearl Road, Parma Heights, Ohio.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances,
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Parma Heights, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.11   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure.” A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal.” A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood.” The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE).” The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   (e)   “Basement.” Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development.” Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.” See “Lowest floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).” The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.” A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “flooding.” A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).” Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones.” Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation.” The flood protection elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a “manufactured home park” means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a “manufactured home park”, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Parma Heights
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 17, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.” Also known as “areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. “Special flood hazard areas” may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.” A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections 1385.34 through 1385.39.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.23   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood

1385.33   ASSURANCE OF FLOOD-CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1385.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Parma Heights and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1385.33(a)(2)A. and C. through E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the bankfull stage.
The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods presented
in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood- carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1385.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.37   VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City.
   (b)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1385.37(b)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 2010-20. Passed 9-13-10.)
1385.38   PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.

1394.01   FINDING OF FACT; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the City rental housing
properties which are, or may become in the future, substandard with respect to
the structure and maintenance thereof, or, further, that conditions, including
but not limited to structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, the
appearance of the exterior of the premises, the existence of fire hazards and
unsanitary condition, constitute a menace to the health, safety, welfare and
reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the City. It is further
found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive
deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of creating blighting
conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and
removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate, in
time, the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same. By reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained,
the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and immediate neighborhood and
property values thereby maintained, the desirability and amenities of rental
housing properties and immediate neighborhoods enhanced and the public health,
safety and welfare protected and fostered.
