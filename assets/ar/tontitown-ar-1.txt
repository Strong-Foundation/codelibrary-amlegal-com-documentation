   (D)   Working out of fines. Fines imposed for violation of ordinances may be

addition to any other provided by law, shall have the right to recover in a
civil action the amount of the lowest penalty or fines provided in the
ordinance for each violation or, where the offense is in its nature continuous
in respect to time, for each day's violation thereof, and also the amount of
any license which the person guilty of the violations was required by any such
ordinance to take out.

sheriff’s office, or district court regarding the above-mentioned violations in
this city shall be paid into the City Treasury.

to exceed $10 for each conviction, is levied for each plea of guilty or nolo
contendere or each bond forfeiture in all non- traffic misdemeanors or
violations of city ordinance or state law, or traffic offenses which are
misdemeanors or violations under state law or city ordinances which are
committed within the corporate limits of the City of Tontitown.

      (3)   This additional fine shall be reviewed from time to time by the
appropriate city officials, and as needed may be adjusted by the City Council

employee is responsible for contacting and following up with the vendor on any
erroneous charges or disputed charges as soon as possible. In such an event,
the Card Administrator must be notified immediately.
   (K)   Each Council Member, the Clerk-Treasurer, and the Mayor shall be
authorized to sign checks or drafts on the city accounts, unless otherwise
specifically required by law. Two authorized signatures shall be required on

§ 32.05 CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY FOR MEMBERS AND OFFICIALS.
   (A)   Introduction; purpose.
      (1)   General provisions.
         (a)   The city has adopted this conflict of interest policy (the
"policy"), with respect to its members and officials. All Council Members and
officials should be provided with this policy upon commencement of employment,
election, or appointment, and are required to acknowledge that they have read,
understand, and are in compliance with the terms of the policy. Council Members
and officials should review, on an ongoing basis, circumstances that constitute
a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest, abide by
this policy, and seek guidance when necessary and appropriate.
         (b)   This policy is intended to supplement, but not replace, any
applicable local, state, and federal laws governing conflicts of interest
applicable to public authorities.
      (2)   Required filings. Council Members and officials are required to
file an annual disclosure report with the Clerk/Recorder for the city pursuant
to A.C. § 21-8-703, as may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   Conflicts of interest.
         (a)   A conflict of interest is a situation in which the financial,
familial, or personal interest of a Council Member or official come into actual
or perceived conflict with his or her duties and responsibilities with the
city. Perceived conflicts of interest are situations where there is the
appearance that a Council Member or official can personally benefit from
actions or decisions made in his or her official capacity, or where a Council
Member or official may be influenced to act in a manner that does not represent
the best interests of the city. The perception of a conflict may occur if
circumstances would suggest to reasonable person that a Council Member or
official may have a conflict. The appearance of a conflict and an actual
conflict should be treated in the same manner for the purposes of the policy.
         (b)   A Council Member or official shall not be deemed to have any
apparent or actual conflict of interest by virtue of his or her status as an
official or employee of the city, or by his or her status as the owner of
property, or affiliation with any organization that owns property, connected to
the water or wastewater system of the city.
         (c)   1.   Council Members and officials must conduct themselves at
all times in a manner that avoids any appearance that they can be improperly or
unduly influenced, or that they are acting in a violation of the public trust.
While it is not possible to describe or anticipate all the circumstances that
might involve a conflict of interest, a conflict of interest typically arises
whenever a Council Member or official has or will have:
               A.   A financial or personal interest, either directly or
indirectly, in any person, firm, corporation, or association that has or will
have a transaction, agreement, or any other arrangement in which the city
participates;
               B.   The ability to use his or her position, confidential
information, or the assets of the city to his or her personal advantage;
               C.   Solicited or accepted a gift of any amount under
circumstances in which it could reasonably be inferred that the gift was
intended to influence or could reasonably be expected to influence him or her
in the performance of his or her official duties, or was intended as a reward
for any action on his or her part; or
               D.   Any other circumstances that may make or appear to make it
difficult for the City Council or official to exercise independent judgment and
properly exercise his or her official duties.
            2.   If a Council Member or official has a question as to whether a
conflict of interest exists, he or she may contact the Arkansas Ethics
Commission for clarification and advice.

   (A)   For purposes of this section, the word UNIT shall be defined as one
water meter used by the city for the purpose of calculating water usage. One
water meter shall be considered one unit, regardless of the size of the meter

   (B)   Whenever a request is made to the city for the extension of a water
line and such request is granted, any person connecting to the water line
within the first five years of its completion shall pay a pro-rata share of the
cost incurred for extending the line, based on the total number of units that
have and/or may connect to the water line at the time the connection is made,
including the number of units for those persons requesting the connection. The
number of units to be used in the calculation shall consist of those units
which have already connected to the water line, if any, plus the number of
units that may connect to a water line. Units need not be operational to be
used in the calculation, if it can be determined how many units may connect to
the water line based upon any building permit(s) of record at the time the
connection is made.
   (C)   The city shall not receive in connection fees, as set forth above,
more than 100% of the cost incurred for the installation and/or extension of
any water line.
   (D)   Any person who connects to an extended water line more than five years
after completion of the project shall not be subject to any pro-rating of costs
as set forth in division (B) above, but shall pay according to the hook-up and
meter fees which are in effect at that time.
   (E)   The city is vested with full discretion regarding whether a request
for the extension of a water line should be granted. In addition, the city
reserves the right to determine what portion of the cost, if any, it wishes to
bear for the extension of any such water lines.
   (F)   Any person wishing to connect to a water line as set forth in this
section shall pay for the cost of same by remitting payment to the Water
Department of the city at the time the connection is requested.

such owner shall be required to have such inspections as required by such
plumbing and gas codes.
   (B)   In the event an owner who desires to have city water does not comply
with the terms and provisions of this section, then such owner shall be denied
the right to hook on to such water system. Nothing contained herein, however,

§ 51.20 BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
   (A)   Responsibility. The Tontitown Water Committee is hereby authorized to
implement and administer a Cross Connection and Backflow Prevention Program to
protect potable water supplied in the municipal system of the city. By virtue
of this authority, the Tontitown Water and Sewer Committee and its authorized
agents shall become the Administrative Authority responsible for the
implementation and administration of a Cross Connection and Backflow Prevention
Program for the city. The Administrative Authority is further authorized and
delegated the responsibility to enforce provisions contained in this subchapter
and future amendments hereto.
   (B)    Enforcement. If in the judgment of the Administrative Authority, an
approved backflow prevention device is required to protect the quality of
potable water supplied in the municipal system from nonpotable sources in the
user's water system, the water user shall be given written notice to install an
approved backflow prevention device or devices at one or more specified
locations in the user's water system. The water user shall be required to
immediately install such approved backflow device(s) at one or more specified
locations at the water user's expense. Failure, refusal, or inability of the
water user to install, have tested and maintain said backflow-prevention
devices shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service until such
requirements have been adequately satisfied.
   (C)   Policy. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed
or maintained by the Water and Sewer Committee unless the water supply is
protected as required by federal and state laws and regulations, and provisions
of this subchapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by
the Water and Sewer Committee if a backflow-prevention assembly required by
this subchapter is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found
that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed or if an
unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Services will not be
restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
      (1)   Inspection. The user's system shall be open for inspection at all
reasonable times to authorized representatives of the Administrative Authority
to determine the existence of cross connections or other structural or sanitary
hazards, including violations of this subchapter. When such a condition becomes
known, the Tontitown Water Committee shall have the authority to deny or
immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical
break in the service line until the user has corrected the condition or
conditions in conformance with federal and state statutes and regulations, city
ordinances, standards relating to plumbing and water supplied and the
regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
      (2)   Auxiliary water supply. Municipal water service shall not be
provided to any premises when the user's water system is interconnected to an
auxiliary water supply. When such a condition becomes known, the Water and
Sewer Committee shall have the authority to deny or immediately discontinue
service to the premises until such time the user has installed an approved air-
gap separation to provide a physical break between the user's auxiliary water
supply and the municipal water system An air-gap separation shall be the only
acceptable means to protect the backflow of auxiliary water through the service
connection to the municipal water system, thereby limiting the degree of hazard
that exists.
      (3)   Type of backflow-prevention assembly required. An approved
backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a
user's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the
building to be served, but in all cases, before the first branch line leading
off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:
         (a)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluid systems or
any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create
an actual or potential hazard to the municipal water system, the municipal
water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line,
appropriate to the degree hazard. This shall include the handling of process
water and waters originating from the municipal water system that have been
subjected to deterioration in quality.
         (b)   In the case of premises having internal cross connections that
cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible
to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the municipal
water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line.
      (4)   Type of backflow-prevention assembly required. The type of
backflow-prevention assembly required under division (C)(3) shall depend upon
the degree of hazard that exists as follows:
         (a)   In the case of premises where there are water and/or substances
(s) that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into
the municipal water system, the municipal water system shall be protected
against backflow by an approved double check valve assembly.
         (b)   In the case of premises where there is material danger to health
that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to
the municipal water system, the municipal water system shall be protected
against backflow by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-
pressure backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where such
conditions exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations,
chemical manufacturing plants, and metal plating facilities.
         (c)   In the case of premises where there are cross connections,
either actual or potential, the municipal water system shall be protected
against backflow by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-
pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection.
         (d)   In the case of premises where, because of security requirements
or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make
a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the municipal water system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced-pressure backflow-prevention assembly on each
service connection to the premises.
         (e)   In the case of premises where, in the opinion of the
Administrative Authority, an undue health threat is posed because of the
presence of extremely toxic substances, the Administrative Authority may
require an air-gap at the service connection to protect the municipal water
system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the Administrative
Authority and is dependent on the degree of hazard.
      (5)   Approved backflow-prevention assembly. Any backflow-prevention
assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the
Administrative Authority. The term APPROVED BACKFLOW-PREVENTION ASSEMBLY shall
mean an assembly that has been manufactured in fill conformance with the
standards established by the American Water Works Association and approved by
the Arkansas Department of Health.
      (6)   Certified inspections and operational tests. It shall be the duty
of the user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed
to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per
year, and the unit overhauled at least every five years. In those instances
where the Administrative Authority deems the hazard great enough, certified
inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections are
tests that shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by
the assembly manufacturer's representative or by a certified tester approved by
the Arkansas Department of Health. Is shall be the duty of the water user to
see that these tests are made in a timely matter. The user shall notify the
Administrative Authority in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that
representatives of the Administrative Authority may witness these tests if so
desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the
expense of the water user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective.
Records of such certified tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept for no
less than five years, and a copy submitted to the Administrative Authority
within ten working days of the tests or repairs.
   (7)   Notification. It shall be the duty of the water user at any premises
being provided water service by the Water and Sewer Committee to notify the
Administrative Authority of the installation of a new backflow-prevention
assembly. Certified inspections and operational tests shall be made within ten
working days of the date the new backflow-prevention assembly is placed into
operation. The installation of all new backflow-prevention assemblies shall be
inspected and their operation tested by the assembly manufacturer's
representative, or by a certified tester approved by the Arkansas Department of
Health All fees and expenses for tests and inspections shall be at the expense
of the water user.
   (8)   Exclusion from requirements. All presently installed backflow-
prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this subchapter but
were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of
installation and that have been properly maintained shall, except for the
inspection and maintenance requirements under division (C)(6), be excluded from
the requirements of these rules so long as the Administrative Authority is
assured that they will satisfactorily protect the municipal water system.
Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires
more than minimum maintenance, or when the Administrative Authority finds that
the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by
an approved backflow-prevention assembly, meeting the requirements of this
subchapter.
   (9)   Annual fee. The Administrative Authority is hereby authorized to
collect an annual fee from each user of water maintaining a backflow-prevention
assembly. The annual fees collected shall be used to offset the cost of
establishing and maintaining a record system to permit and track backflow-
prevention assemblies and their annual certification. The annual permit fee
collected by the Administrative Authority shall not exceed the sum as set forth
in § 155.01 for each backflow-prevention assembly maintained by each user of
water.

pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise
be incompatible with the POTW;
      (3)   To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater
and biosolids (sludge) in the course of their employment and the general
public;
      (4)   To improve opportunities for reuse and recycling of wastewater and
biosolids (sludge) from the POTW;
      (5)   To enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, biosolids (sludge) use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject;
      (6)   To provide for penalties for violations of the regulations
established herein; and
      (7)   To promote the implementation of pollution prevention practices by
users of the POTW.
   (B)   This chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits;
provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities, establishes
administrative review procedures; and requires user reporting.

of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Control Authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c).
   (B)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Control Authority
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
C.F.R. 403.6(e).
   (C)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions to
40 C.F.R. 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.
   (D)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.15.

§ 52.012 LOCAL LIMITS.
   Local limits will be established if required, to insure that the maximum
allowable headworks loadings to the wastewater treatment facility are not
exceeded. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the
instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits except by permit from the
Control Authority. The Control Authority may revise or modify the local limits
as required, or if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in
this chapter or the general and specific prohibitions in this chapter or to
insure compliance with federal, state, or local law.
(Ord. 2005-8-226, passed 8-2-05)

§ 52.014 DILUTION.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Control
Authority may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 2005-8-226, passed 8-2-05)
§ 52.015 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND POLLUTION PREVENTION.
   (A)   The Control Authority may develop and require implementation of best
management practices and pollution prevention procedures by unpermitted as well
as permitted individual users, to allow compliance by the system with the
maximum allowable headworks loadings established in this chapter.
   (B)   The Control Authority may also allow implementation of best management
practices and pollution prevention to be on a voluntary basis if it is
determined that this is the most appropriate approach.
   (C)   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES will be specific procedures developed by the
Control Authority to be implemented by the individual user, designed to reduce
the loading of a particular pollutant.
   (D)   POLLUTION PREVENTION will be defined as waste reduction prior to
recycling, treatment or disposal.

restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specialty sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW
and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Control Authority may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Control Authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Control Authority and shall
be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at the user's expense.

discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (E)   In the case of any discharge, including but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch
discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the system, it
is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the
Control Authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location
of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (F)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Control Authority a detailed written report, describing the
nature and cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences.
      (1)   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability that may be incurred as a result of damage to the
system, the environment, or any other damage to user or property.
      (2)   Nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties or other liability that may be imposed by this chapter or other
applicable law.
   (G)   Failure to notify the Control Authority of an accidental discharge may
result in legal action or discontinuation of service.
   (H)   Notice to employees.
      (1)   As a part of the accidental spill prevention plan, a notice shall
be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place,
advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge.
      (2)   Employers shall insure that all appropriate employees are advised
of the emergency notification procedures to be used in the event of an
accidental discharge.

§ 52.083 NOTIFICATION OF DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any person who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the Control Authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities (in writing) of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain this following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications to the Control Authority must be made prior to the commencement
of the discharge.
   (B)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Control
Authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.

Total suspended solids (mg/l)  250                    $0.20
 
   (F)   Charges for extraneous flows. The costs of operation and maintenance
for all flows not directly attributable to users (such as infiltration/inflow)
shall be distributed among users on the same basis as operation and maintenance
charges.
   (G)   Toxic pollutants charges. Each user that discharges any toxic
pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the
sludge of the treatment works shall pay for such increased costs.

should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
actions, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice or the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least five business days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall be served on a
representative of the user who meets the criteria of an authorized signatory. A
show cause hearing shall not be bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(Ord. 2005-8-226, passed 8-2-05)
§ 52.133 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When The Control Authority finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Control Authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time, if the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other rebated
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a national pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of any violation.
Issuance of any continuing violation, issuance of a compliance order shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
(Ord. 2005-8-226, passed 8-2-05)

requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Control Authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 52.136 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Control Authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Control Authority may also immediately suspend a user's discharge,
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or will present or
may present an endangering to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its discharge. In the event of a user's failure
to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Control
Authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection or water service, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals.
The Control Authority may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the
user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Control Authority that the
period of endangerment has passed unless time endangerment proceedings of this
chapter are initiated against the user.
      (2)   If necessary, severance of the sewer connection or water service
may occur without notice.
      (3)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any declared
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Control Authority within ten business
days.

noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claims of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with

   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

§ 52.142 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARD.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in this chapter or the
specific prohibitions except those listed in §
52.009(B)(1), (2), and (8), if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local entity exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Control
Authority was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference was in compliance with applicable biosolids (sludge) use or
disposal requirements.
(Ord. 2005-8-226, passed 8-2-05)
§ 52.143 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section:
      (1)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is essential for
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Control Authority, at least ten business days before
the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Control Authority of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards as soon as
possible but no later than 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five business days
of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including the exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
severe property damage.
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance: and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.
(Ord. 2005-8-226, passed 8-2-05)
§ 52.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Control
Authority for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation per day. In the
case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall
accrue for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to: the
extent of harm caused by the violation and the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
   (C)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

§ 53.08 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF BILL; DELINQUENCY.
   (A)   The fact that legal title to property is in any person, business or
other entity, constitutes prima facie proof that the person, business or other
entity is responsible for the payment of charges provided for in this chapter.

other person using the title holder’s property shall not be grounds for
avoidance of § 53.99.
   (B)   Any bill not paid in full by the due date shall be considered
delinquent and a late fee of 10% of the base rate shall be added to the bill.
Any delinquency not corrected within 60 days shall be considered refusal or

must contain no openings of greater than three inches. The trash containment
facility must be in place no later than at the time of the first required
inspection of the site by the Chief Building Official or his authorized
representative. The trash containment facility shall be emptied, by a hauler
licensed to do business by the Boston Mountain Solid Waste District or its
successor, on a regular basis. If the city receives a complaint regarding a
trash containment facility at a construction site, the Chief Building Official
or his authorized representative shall notify the general contractor in writing
regarding the complaint and shall request that efforts be undertaken by the
general contractor to remedy the situation. If subsequent complaints are
received by the city pertaining to the same construction site, the Chief
Building Official or his authorized representative shall provide the general
contractor with written notice that the general contractor has three working
days in which to remedy the situation. If the general contractor does not
remedy the situation within that time, it shall be considered a violation of
this code and shall be punishable pursuant to §

representative shall cease all inspections until the construction site complies
with this section.
(Ord. 2016-06-578, passed 6-7-16)

sentenced to imprisonment for not exceeding 30 days, or both. Each act of
violation and each day upon which a violation occurs constitutes a separate
punishable offense. Any person, business or other entity refusing or failing to
pay any charge assessed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be
guilty of a violation and punishable as set out in this section. In addition,
if it is judicially determined that any person, business or other entity has
refused or failed to pay any charge assessed pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter for a period of more than 60 consecutive days, the city shall terminate
the city water and other services to the property for which the charge was
made. The person, business or other entity with legal title to the property is

that charges incurred were for services provided to a tenant, agent, or other
person using the title holder’s property, shall not be grounds for staying the
termination of city services provided for in this section.

detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft by identifying and detecting
identity theft red flags and by responding to such red flags in a manner that
will prevent identity theft.
(Ord. 2008-12-327, passed 12-2-08; Am. Ord. 2013-05-423, passed 5-7-13)

§ 54.04 FINDINGS.
   The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) requires every utility, including
public water and sewer systems, such as the Tontitown Water and Sewer
Department to implement an Identity Theft Prevention Program (“ITPP”). The FTC
requirements and regulations are necessary because of § 114 of the Fair and
Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACTA”). The TRC has set forth the ITPP
requirement in 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. Identity theft is defined as a fraud
committed or attempted using identifying information of another person without
authority. The City of Tontitown adopts the program set forth in this chapter
to comply with FTC rules and regulations. In drafting its ITPP, the city has
considered: (1) the methods it provides to open its accounts; (2) the methods
it provides to access its accounts; and (3) its previous experiences with
identity theft. Based on these considerations, the City Council hereby
determines that the City Water and Sewer Department is a low to moderate risk
entity, and as a result develops and implements the streamlined ITPP set forth
hereto. Further, the city determines that the only covered accounts offered by
the city are those under its water and sewer utilities.

2 Asphalt Emulsion meeting the requirements of ASTM Designation D3405 or
current products listed on the ARDOT qualified products list.
      (4)   Curing compound shall be a white pigmented membrane-forming liquid
conforming to the requirements of ASTM Designation C309, Type 2.
   (B)   Forms.
      (1)   Forms shall be made of metal or wood and shall have a depth equal
to or greater than the thickness of the pavement slab. The minimum length of
each section of form used shall be ten feet. Each section or form shall be
uniform and free from undesirable bends or warps.
      (2)   The maximum deviation of the top surface of any section shall not
exceed 1/8 inch, or the inside face not more than 1/4 inch from planned
alignment. The method of connection between sections shall be such that the
joint thus formed shall be free from movement in any direction. Forms shall be
of such cross-section and strength and so secured as to resist the pressure of
the impact and vibration of any equipment which they support, without springing
or settlement.
      (3)   Every ten foot length of form shall have at least three form braces
and pin sockets which shall be spaced at intervals of not more than five feet,
having the end brace and socket not more than six inches from the end of the
form. Approved flexible forms shall be used for construction where the radius
is 150 feet or less.
      (4)   The subgrade under the forms shall be cut and compacted to a width
not less than one foot behind the back of curb and gutter, removing all soft
and yielding areas and replacing with suitable material compacted. Forms shall
be joined neatly and in such a manner that the joints are free from play or
movement in any direction. The supply of forms shall be sufficient to permit
their remaining in place for at least 12 hours after the concrete has been
placed. All forms shall be cleaned and oiled prior to use.
      (5)   The alignment and grade elevations of the forms shall be checked by
the contractor and the necessary corrections made immediately before placing
the concrete. When any form has been disturbed or any subgrade there under has
become unstable, the forms shall be reset and rechecked.
   (C)   Placing concrete.
      (1)   The subgrade shall be moist, but not muddy, at the time of placing
of the concrete. If required by the city, the prepared subgrade shall be
saturated with water the previous night, or not less than six or more than 20
hours prior to placing the concrete. If the subgrade subsequently becomes too
dry, it shall be sprinkled again ahead of placing the concrete, in such a
manner as not to form mud or puddles of water.
      (2)   Contractor shall give the City Engineer at least 24 hours advance
notice before placing concrete, and the subgrade shall be checked and approved
by the City Engineer or his/her designated representative before any concrete
is placed.
      (3)   The concrete shall be mixed in quantities required for immediate
use and shall be deposited on the subgrade to the required depth and width of
the curb and gutter in successive batches and in a continuous operation without
the use of intermediate forms or bulkheads. The concrete shall be placed as
uniformly as possible in order to minimize the amount of additional spreading
necessary. While being placed, the concrete shall be vibrated with suitable
tools so that the formation of voids or honeycomb pockets is prevented.
      (4)   The concrete shall be especially well vibrated and tamped against
the forms along all joints. Care shall be taken in the distribution of the
concrete to deposit a sufficient volume along the outside form lines so that
the curb section can be consolidated and finished simultaneously with the slab.
      (5)   No concrete shall be placed around manholes or other structures
until they have been adjusted to the required grade and alignment.
   (D)   Mechanical placement. Curb and gutter placed by slip-form or extruding
equipment will be accepted providing it complies with all of the above
requirements other than forms.
   (E)   Finishing. The curb shall be tooled to the required radii as soon as
possible after the concrete takes its initial set. The gutter shall be shaped
with a wood float at least four feet long. After the face forms and templates
are removed, the joints shall be tooled and the surface shall be finally
finished with a hard bristle broom to remove all imperfections without
additional mortar or dryer. In all cases, the resulting surface shall be smooth
and of uniform color, free from sags, twists or warps and true to the specified
lines and grades shown on the plans.
   (F)   Expansion joints. Formed with bituminous preformed expansion joints
one-half inch thick or as specified on the plans and precut to exact cross
section of curb, shall be placed at all driveway radii, intersection radii,
stationary structures and at intervals of not more than 195 feet, and at the
location shown on the plans or standard drawings, so that they are not moved by
depositing and compacting the concrete at these joints. Preformed expansion
joint filler shall be of nonextruding type and shall conform to ASTM
Designation D1751 or AASHTO M153. Acceptable materials may be found on the
current ARDOT “Qualified Products List”. Material shall completely separate
concrete the full width and depth of the curb and gutter cross-section.
   (G)   Contraction joints.
      (1)   Contraction joins shall be sawed or formed with templates at
intervals not greater than 15 feet and at the location shown on the plans or
standard drawings and shall be sawed to a depth of 1-1/2 inch and a width of 1/
4 inch. Asphaltic material used in filling these joints shall be as specified
in Section 501 ARDOT Standard Specifications or as approved by the City
Engineer. Contraction joints in proposed medians shall match the location of
joints in pavement.
      (2)   Templates shall be 1/4 inch thick, cut to the configuration of the
curb section shown on the plans. Templates shall be secured so that depositing
and compacting the concrete does not move them. Unless otherwise shown on the
plans, and as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently, the templates
shall be rounded with an edging tool of 1/8 inch radius.
   (H)   Curing. Immediately after the finishing operation has been completed
and as soon as marring of the concrete will not occur, the entire surface of
the newly placed concrete shall be cured according to Section 501 of ARDOT
Standard Specifications.
   (I)   Cold weather protection. Cold weather protection shall be as specified
in Section 501 ARDOT Standard Specifications.
   (J)   Backfilling. After curing, the curb shall be immediately backfilled to
within four inch of the top curb to eliminate any possibility of washing
beneath the curb. The remaining four inch shall be topsoil.
   (K)   Driveway entrance. At all entrances to residences or commercial
buildings the concrete curb shall be removed by saw cutting of either side of
the entrance. All driveway entrances shall require a minimum of two foot formed
and poured transition that will tie to the saw cut curb. Removal of curb by
sledgehammer without first saw cutting shall not be allowed. The practice of
excavating behind the curb and gutter and then backfilling with the broken curb
section concrete is not acceptable. Any backfill shall be Class 7 crushed
limestone.

§ 90.500.7 SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE.
    (A)   The requirement for drainage layers, subsurface drainage, and
underdrains shall be evaluated by the design engineer on an individual project
basis. Pipe underdrains shall be installed at all locations where subsurface
moisture will affect the stability of the subgrade or result in unsatisfactory
pavement performance.
   (B)   Special attention is called to the typical need for all streets in cut
sections and on hillsides to include subsurface drainage systems. The design
engineer shall be required to perform, or acquire, geotechnical and subsurface
investigation to determine the need of subsurface drainage for each street and
segment thereof to be designed and constructed.

§ 90.800.5 ADDITIONAL TESTS AND TESTING FREQUENCY. 
   (A)   Density tests on subgrades and base courses shall be taken every 300
feet or portion thereof, except that each cul-de-sac street shall have a
minimum of two tests taken regardless of its length. The subgrade shall be
compacted to 95% of Standard Proctor (AASHTO T99 Method A or C). The base
course shall be compacted to 95% of Modified Proctor (AASHTO T180 Method D) on
local streets and higher classified streets. Base course placed under curb and
gutter that is four inches or less in thickness will not require density test
but will require “proof rolling”. Minimum base course thickness for local and
higher classified streets is eight inches. For concrete streets the minimum
base course required is three inches. Base course shall not be more than 1/
4 inch less than specified thickness. Random soundings will be performed to
ensure thickness is achieved. Rectification for base course which does not meet
tolerance shall be submitted by engineer of record for review and consideration
by City Engineer. Remedial work will be at the discretion of the City Engineer.
   (B)   Asphalt streets shall be cored every 300 feet or portion thereof for
the purpose of checking density and thickness, except that each cul-de-sac
street shall have a minimum of two cores taken regardless of length, with one
being taken within the cul-de-sac. The location of the core shall be chosen by
the City Engineer or his or her designated representative so as to accurately
represent the quality of the asphalt laid in a particular area. Lanes of
streets laid on different days may be required to have additional cores at City
Engineer’s discretion. Core samples shall be used to indicate asphalt
thickness, and in no case shall be more that 1/4 inch less than specified
thickness. For cores that indicate thickness 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch less than
that specified, isolation cores will be required. To isolate, the contractor,
at no expense to the city, shall cut cores ten feet either side of the initial
core. If one or both of the cores are in the acceptable tolerance, the section
will be accepted. If one or both cores fail, then additional cores will be cut
25 feet away from the initial core in the failing directions. Subsequent cores
will be cut at 50 foot intervals in the direction of failure until a core that
passes tolerance is obtained. The isolated area will be that which falls within
the limits of acceptable thickness. The areas that fall within the 1/4 inch to
1/2 inch less than specified thickness may be removed and replaced or warranted
for five years at 150% of construction cost based on the estimate provided by
the engineer of record. Areas that are determined to exceed the ½ inch less
than specified thickness shall be removed and replaced within the limits of the
acceptable thickness determined by the isolation method.
   (C)   Minimum asphalt density for black base, binder, and surface courses
shall be 92.0% of the maximum theoretical density. Maximum asphalt density for
black base, binder and surface courses shall be 96% of maximum theoretical
density. Asphalt densities that fall between 90% to 92% and 96% to 98% shall be
left in place and an extended warranty of five years at 150% of construction
cost based on the estimate provided by the engineer of record will be required
on the deficient asphalt pavement. Where densities are less than 90% or greater
than 98%, the paving shall be removed and replaced. The limits of the deficient
asphalt pavement shall be determined by the isolation method by first cutting
two cores within two feet each side of the failing core, then add the results
of the density of the original core and the two additional core densities.
Divide by three and if the average of the three core densities fall within the
acceptable ranges as specified above, then that section will be accepted per
the aforementioned requirements. If the average of the original and the two re-
cores fall below acceptable range, then additional cores will be cut first
going 25 feet longitudinally in each direction from the original core and
determining the densities of each. A resulting failing core from that point
will require an additional core being cut 50 feet from that previous core and
will continue in 50 foot increments until a passing core density is obtained.
The failed area will consist of the area falling within the limits of the
passing re- cores and will be addressed per the aforementioned requirements.
   (D)   Minimum thickness of local concrete streets shall be six inches and
minimum 28 day compressive strength shall be 3,500 psi. A formal pavement
design is required for higher classified streets but in no case shall be less
than six inches in depth. A set of cylinders shall be taken for each 100 cubic
yards or portion thereof poured. Admixtures for concrete pavement shall be
approved by the City Engineer prior to placement.
   (E)   Concrete for curb and gutters shall be a minimum 28 day compressive
strength of 3,500 psi. One set of cylinders shall be taken at beginning of pour
then for every 1,000 linear feet of curb and gutter poured, or portion thereof.
   (F)   Concrete streets shall be cored every 300 feet or portion thereof for
the purpose of checking thickness. Thickness shall not be more than 0.50 inches
deficient. Areas of more than 0.50 inches deficiency shall be removed and
replaced. The city may at its sole discretion choose to leave the deficient
concrete slab in place and accept an extended five year warranty for concrete
placement at 150% of construction costs based on estimate provided by the
engineer of record.
   (G)   Concrete testing out less than 85% of design strength shall be removed
and replaced. For concrete falling between 85% and 100% of design strength, an
extended five year warranty for concrete placement shall be provided at 150% of
construction costs based on estimate provided by the engineer of record.
   (H)   All core test holes for concrete and asphalt streets shall be filled
with non-shrink grout flush with final surface within 24 hours of test.

§ 90.1000.4 BORED CROSSINGS: REQUIREMENTS.
   The intent of this section is that all street, alley, sidewalk, road,
highway or other public way, or curb and gutter crossings by utilities and
other parties shall be required to be bored unless an open cut is approved by
the city. Open cut approvals shall not be withheld unreasonably and if
required, shall meet the following requirements:
   (A)   Handling of excavated material. In making excavations or making
improvements in or to any street, alley, sidewalk, road, highway or other
public way or curb and gutter in the city, all material or earth removed and
new material necessary for repairs or for new work shall be handled in a safe
manner and placed where it will cause the least possible inconvenience to the
public. In no case shall such material or earth be stock piled or scattered
over the surface of the pavement or impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic
flow.
   (B)   Making open trench repairs promptly. No trench or opening made on any
street, alley, sidewalk, road, highway, or other public way, or curb and gutter
in this city shall remain open longer than is absolutely necessary, and in no
event more than 24 hours, except by special written permission of the city. If
a cut is required to be open for longer than 24 hours and the party making it
failed to secure the necessary extension of time, and having been notified to
refill the same, failed to do so, then the such refilling shall be made under
the direction of the city at the expense of the party that has secured the
permit. Temporary bridging of the open cut such as “plating” shall be required
if a cut is required to stay open more than 12 hours. For public safety a
minimum “plate” thickness of one inch shall be required.
   (C)   Backfilling generally. Immediately upon the completion of any job, the
backfilling of cuts into any street, alley, sidewalk, road, highway or other
public way, or curb and gutter shall be done as per the city’s current standard
details for such a repair. If no standard detail is available for such a
repair, it shall be repaired in a manner approved by the city.
   (D)   Settling. If the backfilling of any trench or opening settles prior to
the making of permanent repairs, such trench or opening shall immediately be
brought to proper grade by the party that secured the permit as directed by the
city. If such repair has not been made within 24 hours of notification to
permit holder, repairs will be made by the city at the permit holder’s cost.
   (E)   Length of excavation. No excavation shall be made in any street,
alley, sidewalk, road, highway, or other public way or curb and gutter in the
city that exceeds 400 feet in length at any one time, except by special written
permission of the city.
   (F)   Emergency cuts and excavations. Nothing in this article shall prevent
any person from opening any street, alley, sidewalk, roadway or other public
way or curb and gutter as may be necessary for the preservation of life or
property when necessity may arise during the times when city offices are
closed. The person making such excavation shall make application for a permit
within 24 hours after city offices are first opened subsequent to the making of
such excavation.
   (G)   Application for all street cuts or bores shall be made with the City
Planning and Permits Department, and fees will be charged as outlined in §
155.01.

jacked or bored under any street shall have a minimum depth of bury of two and
one-half feet below the low points of the street cross section to the top of
the pipe or casing, or three and one-half feet below the bottom of the pavement
structure (top of subgrade) to the top of the pipe or casing, whichever gives
the greatest depth. In the case of a street section with a ditch section, the
bury shall be a minimum of one foot below flow line, but still a minimum of the
above referenced depth below street section, whichever is greater. If the
pavement or curb and gutter structure is damaged by the jacking or boring
installation, it shall be repaired in a manner approved by the city.

deposit with the city, and the balance of the deposit, if any, shall be paid to
the permit holder. Additional permits issued to such permit holder shall
require increased permit fees, and increased bond amounts required, as follows:

in writing to the city on using an application form that is provided by the
City of Tontitown for that purpose. Each application shall state the name of
the applicant, the names of all owners, all names used in business, state and
federal tax identification numbers, address of principal location, addresses of
all annexes or any other buildings related to business, the number of buildings
occupying each address, the number of individuals employed at each address, the

   (B)   All applications required hereunder shall be kept and filed by the
Code Enforcement Officer, Clerk-Treasurer or designee and bear the signature of
the appropriate official.
   (C)   (1)   Any person or entity which is granted a license under this
chapter may have said license revoked or suspended if the Code Enforcement
Officer or designee has reason to believe that grounds exist to justify the
suspension or revocation of a business license. Such grounds that could support
the suspension or revocation of a license include:
         (a)   The license holder is operating the business in a dangerously
unsanitary or unhealthy manner, or in such a manner as to unreasonably and
adversely affect the peace, health or safety of neighbors or others in the
city.
         (b)   The premises are a fire hazard or otherwise unsafe for occupancy
because of violations of building, property maintenance or fire codes.
         (c)   The business is being operated in violation of any federal,
state or local law or regulation, including city ordinances and regulations, or
has had a necessary state or city license suspended or revoked.
         (d)   The business license was procured through fraud or
misrepresentation.
      (2)   If the Code Enforcement Officer or designee has reason to believe
the grounds exist that could justify the suspension or revocation of a license,
a letter sent by first class mail shall be sent to the business mailing address
shown on the application notifying the business owner of the possible grounds
to suspend or revoke the license and notifying the business of the time and
place of a due process hearing which shall be set not less than five days and
no more than ten days of the date of the letter.
      (3)   The Mayor shall designate the appropriate city official or agent as
the hearing officer to conduct the due process hearing, and this official or
agent shall receive and hear evidence from city employees or others regarding
the grounds to suspend or revoke the license. The license holder shall be
provided a reasonable opportunity to explain or provide evidence to rebut any
allegations and to show why the license should not be suspended or revoked. The
hearing officer shall then make one of the following determinations based on
the severity of the allegations:
         (a)   Revoke the license.
         (b)   Suspend the license for not more than 30 days.
         (c)   Place the license in probation statute for not more than 90 days
on condition that the grounds leading to the due process hearing will be
remedied by the business owner and not allowed to reoccur. If the business is
found to be compliance with the terms of the probation, the probation status
shall be lifted by the hearing officer and no further action shall be taken. If
the hearing officer determines that the business has failed to be in compliance
with the terms of the probation or if new grounds for suspension or revocation
have occurred, the hearing officer shall conduct a second due process hearing
and consider all previous evidence, hear new any evidence, and shall provide
the license holder a reasonable opportunity to explain or provide evidence to
rebut the allegations. At the conclusion of the second due process hearing, the
hearing officer shall decide whether or not the license shall be suspended or
revoked.
         (d)   Refuse to revoke or suspend the license.
      (4)   Any person or entity whose license has been suspended or revoked
may appeal such suspension or revocation to the City Council by providing a
letter to the City Clerk-Treasurer for the City Council to review the decision
within ten days of the issuance of the suspension or revocation. The City
Council shall then hear the appeal at the next available City Council meeting
following the receipt of the appeal. The license holder shall be notified by
first class mail of the date and time of the hearing and shall be afforded a
reasonable opportunity to present evidence, testimony and to provide
explanations to the City Council on whether or not the license should be
suspended, revoked or that no suspension or revocation is warranted.
      (5)   Any business or former license holder whose license granted under
this chapter is revoked or suspended may not operate or conduct said business
within the city limits, until such time as the license is reinstated or a new
license is issued. In addition to any other remedy, fine, or enforcement
available to the city, if any business or other license holder continues to
operate or conduct business in the city limits, without the required license
following revocation or suspension of said license, the city may seek an
injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the former license
holder from operating without a license.
      (6)   Any business which operates or conducts business within the city
limits without the license required by this chapter may be issued a Notice to
Cease and Desist. Such Notice to Cease and Desist shall be issued by the Code

shall be sent to the business mailing address shown on the application. The
Notice of Cease and Desist may also be provided by to the business by personal
delivery to the owner of the business or managing agent of the business as

business. In addition to any other remedy, due, or enforcement available to the

§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The Legislature of the State of Arkansas has in A.C. §§ 14-268-101 et seq.
delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Tontitown,
Arkansas does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 91, passed 10-1-89; Am. Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified Special
Flood Hazard Areas of Tontitown in the current scientific and engineering
report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Washington County,
Arkansas and Incorporated Areas," dated May 16, 2008, with an effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated May 16, 2008.
   (B)   These Special Flood Hazard Areas are subject to periodic flooding
events that result in loss of life and property, pose health and safety
hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (C)   These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the cumulative
effect of floodplain developments which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately
floodproofed or otherwise unprotected structures or uses vulnerable to floods
into Special Flood Hazard Areas. Such structures or uses are inherently
hazardous to other lands because of their adverse impact on flooding events.
(Ord. 91, passed 10-1-89; Am. Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development
activities, and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in
identified Special Flood Hazard Areas. This chapter advances the stated purpose
through provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Protect natural floodplains against unwise development;
   (C)   Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development;
   (D)   Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects;
    (E)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (F)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events;
   (G)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
Special Flood Hazard Areas;
   (H)   Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base;
and
   (I)   Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a Special
Flood Hazard Area.
(Ord. 91, passed 10-1-89; Am. Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.04 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the
jurisdiction of the City of Tontitown.
(Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   This chapter uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose:
   (A)   This chapter restricts or prohibits structures or uses in Special
Flood Hazard Areas that adversely impact health, safety or property during
flooding events;
   (B)   This chapter requires protection against flood damage for structures
or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction, or after
substantial improvement of the structure, or after substantial damage has
occurred;
   (C)   This chapter controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation and transport of flood waters;
   (D)   This chapter controls floodplain development (structural development,
placement of manufactured structures, clearing, grading, mining, drilling,
dredging, placement of fill, excavating, watercourse alteration, drainage
improvements, roadway or bridge construction, individual water or sewer
installations and other activities) which may increase flood damage by
increasing flood elevations, flood water velocities, or flood discharge
patterns;
   (E)   This chapter regulates the construction of flood barriers which
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may adversely impact other lands.
(Ord. 91, passed 10-1-89; Am. Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.06 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CODE ADOPTED BY REFERENCE.
   The city has published notice as required by law to adopt the Flood Damage
Prevention Code as a technical code by reference. The city has had and shall
continue to have three copies of the Flood Damage Prevention Code on file in
the office of the City Clerk for inspection and copying by the public.
Therefore, the "Flood Damage Prevention Code for the City of Tontitown,
Arkansas," dated February 5, 2008 is adopted by reference. The code shall
include:
   ARTICLE 1 DEFINITIONS
   ARTICLE 2 ADMINISTRATION
   ARTICLE 3 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
(Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter does not repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Whenever there is a conflict or overlap
between this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed
restriction, the instrument with the more stringent restrictions applies.
(Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions must:
   (A)   Be considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Be liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes. Documented scientific and engineering data
form the basis for these requirements. On rare occasions, flooding events
greater than those considered for this chapter will occur. In addition, flood
heights may increase over time due to man-made or natural causes. This chapter
does not imply that land outside Special Flood Hazard Areas will be free from
flooding, nor that strict adherence to this chapter protects uses permitted
within Special Flood Hazard Areas from all flood damages. This chapter
specifically does not create liability on the part of the community, nor any
official or employee of the community, for any flood damages that result while
strictly following this chapter, or from any lawful administrative decision
made under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.10 COMPLIANCE.
   Constructing, locating, substantially altering or changing the use of any
structure or land after the effective date of this chapter requires full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.11 PENALTY FOR NON-COMPLIANCE.
   Flood hazards are reduced by compliance with the provisions of this code.
Accordingly, enforcement of this chapter discourages non-compliance and is a
recognized mechanism for flood hazard reduction. The Floodplain Administrator
must enforce the provisions of this chapter and is authorized to:
   (A)   Issue cease and desist orders on non-compliant floodplain development
projects;
   (B)   Issue citations for non-compliance;
   (C)   Request that FEMA file a 1316 Action (Denial of Flood Insurance)
against non-compliant properties; and
   (D)   Take any other lawful action necessary to prevent or remedy any
instance of non-compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (1)   It is a misdemeanor to violate or fail to comply with any provision
of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person found, in a court of competent jurisdiction, guilty of
violating this chapter is subject to fines of not more than $500 per day for
each violation; in addition, the defendant is subject to payment of all
associated court costs and costs involved in the case.
(Ord. 2008-02-305, passed 2-5-08)
§ 151.12 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter shall be in full force and effect from and after May 16, 2008.

is sufficient in terms of quantity, dependability, fire protection, and quality
to provide an appropriate supply of water for the type of subdivision proposed.
The applicant shall provide verification of approval from the State Department
of Health or governing utility.
   (B)   Sewer. If a public sewage system is proposed, adequate provision has
been made for such a system and, if other methods of sewage disposal are

regulations. The applicant shall provide verification of approval from the
State Department of Health or governing utility.
   (C)   Special precautions. All areas of the proposed subdivision which may
involve soil or topographical conditions presenting hazards or requiring
special precautions have been identified by the subdivider and that the
proposed uses of these areas are compatible with such conditions.
   (D)   Transportation.
      (1)   The existing transportation system is adequate to accommodate the
traffic to be generated by the subdivision. The Planning Commission may
require, as part of plat approval, a traffic study, prepared by professional
traffic engineer and paid for by the developer, demonstrating that existing
streets can handle the proposed traffic. The city also may require that the
developer provide plans and profiles showing existing ground surface, proposed
and established street grades, including extensions for a reasonable distance
beyond the limits of the proposed development.
      (2)   If the traffic study indicates that the development will create
more demand than the existing transportation system can accommodate, the
developer shall show that it will make appropriate off-site improvements to
meet the increase in demand and capacity.
      (3)   The city reserves the right to hire an independent consultant to
verify the findings of the original study.
   (E)   Testing verification. The city may require borings and soundings be
made in specific areas to ascertain subsurface conditions where proposed
subdivision will not be served by public sanitary sewer service. The data will
be submitted to the Arkansas Department of Health when obtaining approval of
the subdivision sanitary facilities.
   (F)   Mitigation. The developer has taken every effort to mitigate the
impact of the proposed subdivision on public health, safety, and welfare.
   (G)   Design standards. The plans must meet the requirements of §§
152.140 through
152.152.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 152.140 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this portion of these regulations is to
specify the basic and minimum requirements for lots, blocks, streets, and other
physical elements in new residential subdivisions. It also provides a guide for
the staff, the Planning Commission and the applicant in the review and
preparation of subdivision plats.
   (B)   Suitability of land. Land subject to flooding or topographically
unsuitable for residential occupancy and which the Planning Commission
considers unsuitable for subdividing shall not be platted for any use that may
increase the danger to health, life, property or aggravate erosion or flood
hazard. When such land is in the proposed plat, this land shall be set aside
for such land uses as will not be affected by periodic flooding or unsuitable
topographic conditions unless adequate corrective measures are formulated by
the developer and approved by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Provision of land for public purposes. Where proposed community or
public facilities are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision,
the Planning Commission, City Council, or public board shall require that land
for those public facilities be reserved as a condition of preliminary plat
approval. Such reservations shall be referred to the appropriate public board,
commission, or body having jurisdiction or financial responsibility to permit
the opportunity to acquire said sites either through purchase, taking an
option, or the filing of condemnation proceedings under the power of eminent
domain. The contract to acquire the subject public site must be closed within
12 months following the date of approval of the preliminary plat by the
Planning Commission or the subdivision process shall continue without regard
for the proposed community or public facilities.
   (D)   Access. A publicly dedicated street shall serve every subdivision.
Every lot or parcel within a subdivision shall have access to a publicly
dedicated street, a dedicated easement, or in the case of a PUD or PRD, access
to a public street by means of a private street. All lots shall front on public
streets except for PUD or PRDs where the Planning Commission may approve the
private streets.
   (E)   Fitness for development. Based on topographic maps, soil surveys
prepared by the Department of Agriculture, drainage information from the
General Plan and any special studies made by or for the city or information
provided by the developer, the Planning Commission may require that steep
grades, unstable soil and floodplains be set aside and not subdivided until
corrections are made to protect life, health and property.

Planning Commission approval and new commercial developments all utility wires,
lines, and/or cables in the developments utilized by electric and/or
telecommunications companies shall be placed underground. Overhead wires,
supporting structures, and associated structures of a temporary nature which
provide temporary service are exempt from this requirement. A single power pole
near the exterior boundary of a development shall be allowed to provide
connections for underground service, except in minor subdivisions as defined in
§
152.080.
   (D)   Structures. No structures shall be located within a utility easement.
(Ord. 2013-04-417, passed 4-2-13; Am. Ord. 2013-09-440, § 152.1000.2, passed 9-

§ 152.143 LOTS.
   (A)   Access. Every lot shall have access to a public street except where
private streets are explicitly approved by the Planning Commission in planned
unit developments or planned residential developments.
   (B)   Shape. The shape of residential lots shall conform to the design of
the subdivision. The Planning Commission shall judge lot shapes on the type of
development and the use for which the lot is intended.
   (C)   Dimensions. Except as provided herein, the minimum lot dimensions
shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zoning
districts within which the subdivision is located.
   (D)   Setbacks. The minimum building setback line shall be as defined in
Tontitown zoning ordinance §
153.021.
   (E)   Floodways. A minimum building setback line shall be established on the
plat not less than 25 feet from any floodway boundary. This shall not affect
plats that have been initiated prior to the passage of this chapter and filed
while final plat approval is in effect.
   (F)   Corner lot size. Corner lots should be roughly 20% larger than
interior lots.
   (G)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots other than corner lots
fronting on two streets shall not be platted except under extreme
circumstances, as may be approved by the Planning Commission, in which case
building lines shall be established for both front and rear lot lines. Double
frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where they are
needed to provide for the separation of residential developments and traffic
arteries or to overcome specific topographic or site constraints. Where double
frontage exists, a planting screen easement of at least ten feet shall be
provided along a portion of the lot abutting the traffic artery or other use
where screening is required. In this circumstance, there shall be no right of
access across the planting screen easement. At the discretion of the Planning
Commission, the developer may substitute for an easement and a planting screen,
a permanent ornamental fence or wall of the height and architectural character
which will be appropriate and appropriately screened. Should the ornamental
wall or fence be used, there shall still be a restriction upon right of access
and such restriction shall clearly be so designated on the plat and within the
accompanying bill of assurance.
   (H)   Slope and drainage. Every lot must slope to a street or its intended
stormwater collection system.
(Ord. 2013-04-417, passed 4-2-13; Am. Ord. 2013-09-440, § 152.1000.4, passed 9-
3-13; Am. Ord. 2017-05-636, passed 5-2-17)
§ 152.144 STREETS.
   (A)   Standard street specifications. All streets shall be constructed in
conformance with at least the requirements of the city’s current adopted Master
Street Plan.
   (B)   Right-of-way dedication. Subdivisions and large-scale developments
shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way to bring those streets which the Master
Street Plan shows to abut or intersect the development into conformance with
the right-of-way requirements of the Master Street Plan for said streets;
provided the Planning Commission may recommend a lesser dedication in the event
of undue hardship or practical difficulties. Such lesser dedication shall be
subject to approval by the City Council.
   (C)   Coordination. The street system of a proposed subdivision shall be
designed to coordinate with existing, proposed, and planned street outside of
the subdivision as provided in this section.
   (D)   Connectivity. Local and residential streets shall connect with
surrounding streets to permit the safe and convenient movement of traffic
between residential neighborhoods or facilitate emergency access and
evacuation, but such connections shall not be permitted where the effect would
be to encourage the use of such streets by substantial through traffic.
      (1)   Gated communities. To ensure public safety with easy access to
residential neighborhoods by police, fire and ambulance services and to
maintain neighborhood connectivity as described above, gated communities are
prohibited.
         (a)   In cases where site conditions do not allow for adequate
connectivity, a waiver may be requested in accordance with §
152.026. The waiver shall be reviewed based on the following criteria:
            1.   The development is adjacent to developed land that does not
provide locations for connection of the street system.
            2.   The development is adjacent to topography with slopes greater
than 17%.
            3.   The property does not include a collector, minor or principal
arterial shown on the Master Street Plan.
   (E)   Street stubs. Wherever a proposed development abuts un-platted land or
a future development phase of the same development, street stubs shall be
provided as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to provide access to
abutting properties or to logically extend the street system into the
surrounding area. All street stubs shall be provided with temporary turn-around
or cul-de-sacs unless specifically exempted by the City Engineer or Planning
Commission, and the restoration and extension of the street shall be the
responsibility of any future developer of the abutting land.
   (F)   Street intersections. Street intersections shall be designed to ensure
safety. Because steep grades at intersections reduce sight distances and hinder
vehicle control, street grades shall be flattened out within 100 feet of
intersections according to AASHTO gemotric design guidelines for highways and
city streets.
   (G)   Additional safeguards. These requirements shall be considered
minimums, and where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission for the
interest of public health, safety, and welfare, additional safeguards may be
required.
   (H)   Residential street lights.
      (1)   Public streets. Developers of all new residential subdivisions with
public streets shall select either (a) the standard street light option, or (b)
an upgraded street light option.
         (a)   Standard street light option.
            1.   Description. The standard streetlight meets IESNA’s
(Illuminating Engineering Society of North America) definition of “cutoff” and
is a light fixture of traditional styling. Specifications for standard street
light fixtures, as amended, are on file at the servicing Electric Department.
            2.   Developer responsibility. The developer shall share the cost
of the standard fixture with the City of Tontitown. The developer shall provide
the one and one-half inch conduit raceway, surface mount foundation and anchor
system, as specified by the servicing electric provider.
         (b)   Upgraded street light option.
            1.   Description. The decorative street lights are cutoff fixtures
of traditional or period styling. Specifications for upgraded street light
luminaires and poles, as amended, are on file at the Tontitown Planning
Department.
            2.   Private streets. The developer of new subdivisions that have
private streets shall contribute 100% of the cost for a standard street light
fixture, as described in division (H)(1)(a)1., or upgraded street light fixture
as described in division (H)(1)(b)1. The developer and/or property owners
association shall be responsible for the cost of electrical power service and
ongoing maintenance and upkeep of the fixtures. The city shall bear no
responsibility for street lights located on private streets.

      (1)   Material. The primary material shall constitute at least 75% of the
wall area, excluding glass. The primary exterior material shall consist of a
combination of brick, textured concrete block, stucco, wood, synthetic stone or
natural stone. The remaining exterior material shall be considered building
trim. TRIM is defined as an ornamental design feature, that when removed does
not significantly alter the appearance of the building. This commonly consists
of moldings, cornices, parapet, frieze, sills, lintels, stringcourse, quoining,
and ledgement. No masonite, asphaltic exterior wall or roof material, aluminum
or steel siding (other than approved architectural metal), non-textured
concrete block (ground-faced is allowed), vinyl or other similar materials
shall constitute a portion of any building except trim.
      (2)   Color. The building’s exterior color scheme shall utilize primarily
muted, neutral, or earth tone type colors. The primary use of bright, intense,
or extreme colors not consistent with the adjoining developments shall not be
permitted. This regulation is not intended to prohibit the use of these colors
for specifically approved architectural detailing.
      (3)   Compatibility. All commercial, institutional, triplex, quadplex,
and multi-family structures shall be designed in a manner compatible with other
structures in the surrounding vicinity. The exterior building design, including

consistent among all buildings in a common commercial development and on all
elevations of each building to achieve design harmony and continuity within
itself.
      (4)   Scale and bulk. The height and scale of new buildings shall be
consistent or compatible with the height and scale of adjacent buildings.
Special care, however shall be taken to achieve the compatibility of larger
buildings next to small scale buildings; techniques shall include limited size,
building articulation, and shadow patterns. The scale of the building shall
also consider building setback, lot size and relationship to street width.
      (5)   Wall articulation. Buildings shall avoid long uninterrupted façade
planes and/or blank walls. All commercial, institutional, triplex, quadplex,
and multi-family buildings with facades greater than 50 feet in length shall
incorporate wall plane projections or recess that are at least two feet deep.
Projections/recess must be at least 25% of the length of the façade. No
uninterrupted length of a façade may exceed 50 feet in length.
      (6)   Facades. All commercial, institutional, triplex, quadplex, and
multi-family structures shall be architecturally finished on all sides with
same materials, detailing, and features when visible from the public realm or
adjacent residential areas. The degree of visibility from the public realm
shall be evaluated using the following criteria:
         (a)   The degree of visibility from all adjacent public ways;
         (b)   Possible visibility from future buildings and public ways;
         (c)   Internal overall appearance in relation to the site; and
         (d)   If adjacent to, and visible from, residential uses, residential
zoning categories, or other marginally compatible uses.
      (7)   Roofs. Roof lines and/or parapets shall be varied with a change in
height every 100 linear feet in the building length. Parapets, gable roofs,
high roofs, or dormers shall be used to conceal flat roofs and rooftop
equipment from public view. Alternative lengths and designs may be acceptable
and may be approved by Planning Commission.
      (8)   Entrances. Each primary building on a site, regardless of size,
shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less
than two of the following:

         (l)   Other architectural features approved by Planning Commission.
   (F)   Utility and mechanical equipment screening: commercial, institutional,
triplex, quadplex and multi-family uses.
      (1)   Screening of service yards, utility meters and hardware, mechanical
equipment, refuse areas, and/or other potentially unattractive places from
public view, shall be accomplished by the use of walls, fencing, planting, or a
combination of the measures that follow. Screening shall be equally effective
in the winter and the summer seasons. For rooftop equipment, parapet walls or
other screening methods approved by Planning Commission are required along
street frontages and bordering residential areas.
         (a)   Adjusting the architectural or landscape profile to screen those
elements from view.
         (b)   Placing those elements on service courts or other locations
usable by the general public.
         (c)   Integrating those elements into the architecture or landscaping
of the site.
      (2)   The degree of visibility and screening of service yards, utility
meters and hardware, mechanical equipment, refuse areas, and/or other
potentially unattractive places shall be evaluated using the following
criteria:
         (a)   The degree of visibility from all adjacent public ways;
         (b)   The architectural compatibility of the design and color of the
yards, meters and equipment of the building;
         (c)   Possible visibility from future buildings and public ways;
         (d)   Internal overall appearance in relation to the site; and
         (e)   If adjacent to and visible from residential uses, residential
zoning categories, or other marginally compatible uses.
   (G)   Site planning: commercial, institutional, triplex, quadplex and multi-
family uses.
      (1)   Building placement. Place as much of the building width at the
front of the lot as possible to maximize front façade exposure to the public.
The front façade shall be kept parallel with the street. On corner lots, place
as much building mass near the intersection as possible to help anchor the lot
and take advantage of high visibility.
      (2)   Parking placement.
         (a)   Commercial and institutional uses. No more than 60% of the off-
street parking area for the entire property shall be located between the front
façade within the front yard of the principal building and the primary abutting
street unless the principal building and/or parking lots are screened from view
by outlot development and additional tree plantings or berms. Whenever
possible, attempt to link with adjacent parking lots or provide shared parking
areas which can serve neighboring buildings simultaneously. Shared drives and
cross access between properties shall be required to adjacent developed and
undeveloped properties. Access easements shall be shown on the site plan to
provide cross access to adjacent properties. The location of this cross access
shall be approved by the Planning Official. Parking lots shall be designed in
regular, rectangular shapes.
         (b)   Triplex, quadplex, and multi-family uses. Parking is to be
primarily interior to the development with the building façade along the
street, unless the parking lots are screened from view by additional landscape
buffering. If a primary street is required for connectivity, parking may be
placed along this street, but must be clearly defined by landscaped curb bump
outs between buildings, or every 20 parking spaces. Shared drives and cross
access between properties shall be required to adjacent developed and
undeveloped properties. Access easements shall be shown on the site plan to
provide cross access to adjacent properties. The location of this cross access
shall be approved by the Planning Official.
      (3)   Pedestrian circulation. Clearly defined pedestrian walkways or
paths shall be provided from parking areas to primary building entrances.
Design walkways and parking lots so that pedestrians do not have to cross
parking aisles and landscape islands to reach building entries. All internal
walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of
durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored
concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the
attractiveness of the walkways. Painted crosswalks shall not be considered
sufficient definition of the pedestrian path from the driving surface.
   (H)   Amenities: triplex, quadplex, and multi family uses.
      (1)   All triplex, quadplex, and multi-family developments with over 40
units shall provide at least one of the following amenities:

main entrance that extends to the roofline. The wainscot and entry façade
material shall consist of a combination of brick, textured concrete block,
stucco, wood, synthetic stone, or natural stone. The remaining exterior
material shall not include masonite, asphaltic exterior wall or roof material,
aluminum or steel siding (other than approved architectural metal), non-
textured concrete block (ground-faced is allowed), vinyl, or other similar
materials. Building trim shall also be included. TRIM is defined as an
ornamental design feature, that when removed does not significantly alter the
appearance of the building. This commonly consists of moldings, cornices,
parapet, frieze, sills, lintels, stringcourse, quoining, and ledgement.
      (2)   Color. The building’s exterior color scheme shall utilize primarily
muted, neutral, or earth tone type colors. The primary use of bright, intense,

articulation, and shadow patterns. The scale of the building shall also
consider building setback, lot size, and relationship to street width.
      (5)   Wall articulation. Buildings shall avoid long uninterrupted façade
planes and/or blank walls. All industrial buildings with façades greater than
300 feet in length shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses that
are at least two feet deep. Projections/recesses must be at least 25% of the
length of the façade. No uninterrupted length of a façade may exceed 300 feet
in length.
      (6)   Façades. All industrial structures shall be architecturally
finished on all sides, as detailed in (I)(1) with the same materials,
detailing, and features when visible from the public realm or adjacent to
residential areas. The degree of visibility from the public realm shall be
evaluated using the following criteria:
         (a)   The degree of visibility from all adjacent public ways;
         (b)   Possible visibility from future buildings and public ways;
         (c)   Internal overall appearance in relation to the site; and
         (d)   If adjacent to, and visible from, residential uses, residential

zoning categories, or other marginally compatible uses.
   (K)   Site planning: industrial uses. This division applies to buildings
within industrial zones only.
      (1)   Building placement. Buildings shall be placed so that they have the
least amount of impact on surrounding properties. Buffering, landscaping, and
setbacks should be used to enhance compatibility when and industrial use is
abutting a commercial use, marginally compatible use, or when abutting a
residential use/residential zoning category.
      (2)   Parking placement. No more than 60% of the off-street parking area
for the entire property shall be located between the front façade within the
front yard of the principal building and the primary abutting street, unless

§ 152.152 AESTHETICS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES (WCF).
   The following guidelines shall govern the aesthetics of all towers and
antennas, provided however, that the City Engineer may waive these requirements
where it is determined that the goals of this chapter would be better served
thereby.
   (A)   Lighting. Lighting of tower and antenna shall meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Towers shall be artificially illuminated if required by the FAA or
other applicable authority or the governing authority. If artificial lighting
is required, the lighting design and intensity chosen should be that which
complies with the applicable guidelines, yet causes the least disturbance to
the surrounding and nearby properties.
      (2)   Security lighting or motion-activated lighting may be used around
the base of a tower and within the telecommunication facility, provided that
the lighting is shielded in such a way that no light is directed towards
adjacent properties or rights-or-way.
   (B)   Stealth technologies. This chapter encourages creative design measures
to camouflage facilities by integrating them with existing buildings and among
other existing uses. Based on this, the color and design of towers and antennas
shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Towers shall be maintained with a galvanized steel finish, wood
laminate or, subject to any applicable FAA standards, be painted a neutral
color so that visual obtrusiveness is minimized.
      (2)   The design of buildings and related structures within a
telecommunication facility shall, to the extent possible, utilize building
materials, colors, screening, and landscaping that will camouflage and blend
the tower and related facilities into the natural and/or surrounding
environment.
      (3)   If an antenna is to be attached to a supporting structure other
than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment
must be of a color closely compatible with the color of the supporting
structure.

IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.160 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Generally. The subdivider shall be required to install improvements,
where the need for such improvements is created in whole or in part by the
proposed subdivision, in accordance with § 152.161. For purposes of this
section, an OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENT shall mean any improvement listed in these
regulations which are to be installed on property located outside the proposed
subdivision.
   (B)   Installation. Any required improvements shall be installed according
to city standards; provided improvements to roads located outside the city’s
corporate limits but within the city’s planning area shall be installed to
county standards. The subdivider shall be required to bear that portion of the
cost of improvements which bears a rational nexus to the needs created by the
subdivision.
   (C)   Proportionate share. At the time the Planning Commission grants
preliminary plat approval, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the
proposed subdivision creates a need for improvements and the portion of the
cost of any needed improvements which the subdivider shall be required to bear;
provided, that portion of the cost of improvements to roads located outside the
city’s corporate limits but within the city’s planning area shall be determined
by the county. In determining that portion of the cost of improvements which
the subdivider shall be required to bear the Planning Commission shall consider
the acreage within the proposed subdivision as a percentage of all the acreage
which, when fully developed will benefit from the offsite improvements;
provided, the Planning Commission may use a different method of measurement if
it determines that use of the acreage standard will not result in the
subdivider bearing that portion of the cost which bears a rational nexus to the
needs created by the subdivision.

§ 152.161 DETERMINING NECESSITY FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Indirect access to substandard streets. When a proposed subdivision
has access to paved streets or roads only by way of substandard or unimproved
roads or streets leading from the subdivision to the paved streets or roads,
the subdivider shall be responsible for contributing his or her proportionate
share of the cost of improving the substandard access roads or streets to
existing city standards. The subdivider’s proportionate share of the costs
shall be determined by the Planning Commission in accordance with the
provisions of §
152.160.
   (B)   Direct access to substandard streets. When a proposed subdivision has
direct access to, or fronts on, an existing road or street which is below
current standards, the subdivider shall be responsible for contributing his or
her proportionate share of the cost of improving the street or road to existing
city standards. The Planning Commission shall determine the subdivider’s
proportionate share of the costs in accordance with the provisions of §
152.160.
   (C)   Drainage. Drainage improvements shall be required whenever a proposed
subdivision causes the need for such improvements.
   (D)   If minimum lot size created by preliminary plat exceeds ten acres the
Planning Commission may waive certain requirements.
(Ord. 2013-04-417, passed 4-2-13; Am. Ord. 2013-09-440, § 152.1100.02, passed

§ 152.162 FEE IN-LIEU FOR DELAYED IMPROVEMENTS.
   If the Planning Commission determines that a needed improvement cannot be
built until future development occurs, the subdivider shall pay to the city an
amount determined by the Planning Commission in accordance with the standards
prescribed in §
152.160 above to be the developer’s proportionate share of the cost of the
improvements as of the date of final plat approval. The city shall deposit the
money into an interest bearing escrow account until such time as the
improvement is constructed. If the improvement is not constructed within five
years from the date of the first payment into the escrow account by a
subdivider, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing, after
notification to all affected property owners, to determine the disposition of
all money in the escrow account. Following the public hearing, the Planning
Commission may:
   (A)   Determine that the improvement is still necessary and feasible and can
be built within a reasonable time, in which case the escrow account shall be
continued for a period specified by the Planning Commission; or
   (B)   Determine that the improvement is not necessary, or will not be
feasible, or that insufficient development has occurred to render the
improvement likely in the foreseeable future, in which case the Planning
Commission shall either:
      (1)   Refund the money in the escrow account, with accumulated interest,
to the subdividers who made the contributions; or
      (2)   Distribute the money in the escrow account on a pro rata basis to
the property owners who purchased lots in the subdivision(s) and the subdivider
(s); or
      (3)   With the written consent of a majority of the property owners who
have purchased lots in the subdivision(s) and the subdivider(s), direct that
money in the escrow account be utilized for a different purpose which will
specifically benefit the neighborhood.

§ 152.163 WAIVERS.
   A subdivider may petition the Planning Commission for a waiver of
improvement requirements in whole or in part on one or more of the following
grounds:
   (A)   No plans for upgrading. The city has no plans for upgrading the
substandard street or road on which improvements are proposed to be required by
the subdivider.
   (B)   Primary access to improved streets. The proposed subdivision has
primary access to improved streets or roads and the portion of the subdivision
which fronts on a substandard street or road is so small or remote from
anticipated future traffic patterns as to cause an unfair imposition on the
subdivider.
   (C)   Alternate improvements. The subdivider proposes alternative
improvements which will protect the health, safety and welfare of persons
residing in the proposed subdivision and the surrounding area and equally
benefit said persons.

§ 152.164 OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS TO STATE HIGHWAYS AND HIGHWAYS MAINTAINED BY
THE STATE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT.
   The subdivider shall be required to dedicate sufficient right-of-way to
bring those state highways which the Master Street Plan shows to abut or
intersect the proposed subdivision into conformance with the right-of-way
requirements of the Master Street Plan. The subdivider shall be required to
install a sidewalk adjacent to that portion of a state highway abutting the
proposed subdivision; provided, the subdivider shall be permitted to make a
cash contribution in lieu of actual installation, which contribution shall be
an account equivalent to the estimated cost of constructing the required
sidewalk as of the date of final plat approval; and, provided further, that the
Planning Commission may waive the sidewalk requirement prescribed by this
section upon application by the subdivider and a determination by the Planning
Commission that the topography of the proposed subdivision where it abuts a
state highway is such that installation of a sidewalk is not practical. No
other improvements to state highways shall be required of the subdivider unless
required by the State Highway and Transportation Commission.

ADDRESSING
§ 152.235 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter establishes a system for assigning street names and address

protection of public health and safety of all persons living, working or
visiting in the City of Tontitown.

§ 152.238 STREET NAMES.
   (A)   Definition of street. For the purpose of this subchapter, the word
STREET shall mean all roadways, public and private, open for general public
travel. Access drives to apartment and commercial complexes shall not be
considered as private streets.
   (B)   Street names on preliminary plat. Street names shall be shown on the
preliminary plat. The street names shown on the final plat shall be consistent
with those shown on the preliminary plat.
   (C)   Suffix.
      (1)   East and west. Streets running east and west shall be identified
with the suffix “Avenue” or “Boulevard” when applicable.
      (2)   North and south. Streets running north and south shall be
identified with the suffix “Road” or “Street” respectively.
 
Street Suffix
Direction   Suffix
East/West   Avenue Boulevard
North/South Road Street
 
   (D)   State and federal highways. Streets which are also state and federal
highways will be identified by their local street name followed by their state
or federal designation in parenthesis on the official Street Address Map. For
example, Henri De Tonti Boulevard (US 412).
   (E)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sac streets which have only one entrance/exit
shall not be called “Avenue” or “Road” but shall have a suffix name such as
“Cove, Lane, Place or Terrace” to indicate their dead end nature.
   (F)   Loop streets. Loop streets are circular or rectangular plan streets
which begin at one point and end at another point along a common street and do
not connect to any other streets. The street name suffixes on these streets
must not be “Road” or “Avenue” but shall be “Loop, Circle, Court” or other name
indicating a closed street layout.
   (G)   Duplication. Street names shall not be duplicated and names with a
similar pronunciation such as Main/Maine shall be avoided.
   (H)   Name of person. No street shall be named after a person’s first or
last name, unless specifically directed to do so by proclamation from the City

(Ord. 2013-04-417, passed 4-2-13; Am. Ord. 2013-09-440, § 152.1500.04, passed
9-3-13)
§ 152.239 ADDRESS NUMBERS.
   (A)   Final plats. All final plats shall be preaddressed. Large scale
developments with more than one suite shall be addressed by the lot’s common
address along with the individual suite number (i.e., 620 Henri De Tonti Blvd.,
Suite A, Suite B, etc.).
   (B)   Odd and even numbers. Address numbers shall be even on the north and
east sides of the street and odd on the south and west sides of the street.
Address numbers for unplatted residential and all other nonresidential
buildings shall be determined by calculation. The distance from the center of
the driveway to the last corner or grid shall be measured to get a location
number. The location number is then divided by 5.28 to get the address. If the
block number is 1200 and the location number divided by 5.28 is 43, the address
is 1243 or 1244 depending upon which side of the street the building is
located. Address numbers shall be beginning by the number grid in which the
property is located.
   (C)   New residential subdivisions. In new residential subdivisions, each
standard-sized lot shall be given a pre-assigned street number by the Planning
Department upon final plat approval. All pre- addresses shall be reflected on
the final plat at the time it is recorded. Address numbers will be assigned to
large lots relative to their capacity to be divided into two or more minimum
sized lots for the minimum width allowed by the zoning ordinance. Address
numbers shall be assigned to lots in the appropriate odd or even numerical
sequence relative to their location, such as 201, 203, 205, etc.
   (D)   Diagonal streets. Diagonal streets which run 45 degrees or less from a
north/south line will be numbered by the north/south grid and those more than
45 degrees from the north/south line will be numbered by the east/west grid.
Curving streets will be assigned numbers based upon the grid of their greatest
length. For instance, if the beginning is more south than east of the end, then
the north/south grid will be used.
 
Numbering for Diagonal Streets
From North/South Line Grid to be used
45º or less          North/South
More than 45º        East/West
 
   (E)   Loop street and cul-de-sacs. On loop streets and cul-de-sac streets
address numbering shall begin at the entrance nearest the grid centerline.
Address numbers shall increase or decrease relative to their initial movement
from the grid centerline and continue to the opposite end as if the street were
in a straight line. Block number changes will be made every 528 feet with odd
and even numbers remaining on the same side of the street as they began.
   (F)   Apartments.
      (1)   On public streets. Apartment buildings on public streets shall be
assigned individual addresses. Apartments clustered about a central parking
area immediately facing a public street shall also be assigned separate street
addresses.
      (2)   On private streets. Apartment buildings not located on public
streets will be assigned a private street designator. These apartment buildings
shall be assigned individual addresses. In these instances each building is
lettered A, B, C and the like, but a central postal facility for all apartments
must be located so it is readily accessible to a mail carrier for the public
street serving the complex.
      (3)   Building identification. Each apartment must be identified on the
exterior by block grid number. The numbers shall be in sequence increasing from
the centerline. Apartment buildings shall have the block number as part of each
apartment number 1702 Apt. #11. Apartments in lettered buildings shall have the
building letter as part of each apartment number, such as B-210. When units are
on multiple floors, ground floor numbers shall be in the 100 series (101, 102,
103 and the like), second floor in the 200 series (201, 202, 203 and the like).
If a common hallway is used for several apartments, the external hallway
entrance to each apartment shall contain a list of the apartments served. When
addressing townhouses and other buildings containing units separately owned,
each address shall be placed upon the principal external entryway to the unit.
      (4)   Individual units. The official address for each apartment on a
public street shall be the building address followed by the apartment number,
such as “329 E. Central Avenue, Apt # 11”, or “329 E. Central Avenue # 11.”
Addresses for units in apartment buildings not on a public street shall include
the block number, private street designator and apartment number. The official
address for each apartment building not on a public street will be “1702 S.E.
Moberly Manor Dr. Apt # 11” or “702 S.E. Moberly Manor Dr. # 11.” Mobile home
parks on private streets shall be addressed in the same manner as apartment
buildings located on private streets.
   (G)   Suites. Suite numbers (odd or even) shall be determined by its parent
building’s number and will increase in an odd or even manner according to the
layout location from the centroid. In the event of a suite split, the newly
created suite shall be assigned the next lowest available number. Example: A
building with the odd number 201 shall start with suite 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.
Buildings with an even number (202) shall have even suite numbers (2, 4, 6,
etc.). If there was a split in the odd building 201 between suites 3 and 5 the
newly created suite would be numbered suite 4.
   (H)   Corner lots. Structures on corner lots shall not be given dual
addresses. The structure on a corner lot shall be addressed off of the street
where the front entrance is located. If the structure appears to have more than
one front entrance then the structure shall be addressed off of the street with
the shortest frontage.
   (I)   Townhouse. Each unit within a townhome development which is on an
individual lot shall have a separate address number and not a unit number.

If building is not visible from the street, address numbers should be placed at
the street entry to the building. The appeal must filed with the City Clerk
within ten business days after the decision has been rendered. The appeal shall

the appeal, any other necessary information as well as the payment of any
required fee. The City Council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of
the appeal.

DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 153.080 AGRICULTURE AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS; GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
   (A)   Counting the agriculture district, which is considered to be a very
low density single-family district, and acts to serve as a "holding" zone for
subsequent higher density consideration, there are eight districts designed to
meet present and future housing needs; to protect the character of, and
property values in, residential areas; to encourage a suitable environment for
family life; and to provide choice in density, as well as in type of housing.
Five of the districts are for low-density single-family uses, and are intended
to be defined and protected from the encroachment of uses not performing a
function necessary to the low density, residential environment. One district is
intended for medium-density single-family uses, and one exists for multi-family
residential uses. More specific descriptions of the residential districts are
as follows and it is the intent and desire of the city that all zoned areas, be
served by municipal water and sanitary sewer service.
   (B)   Agriculture district. The purpose of this district is to provide for a
very low density single-family district, while helping preserve existing
agricultural resources, and to guide the conversion of these lands to higher
density residential use when appropriate. Agricultural areas should be
protected for development by appropriate standards until they are well served
by public facilities and services that will permit higher density residential
development.
   (C)   R-E, Estate Single-Family district. The purpose of this district is to
accommodate single-family residential development on low density, large estate
type lots. This zone is intended to help establish and preserve rural/estate
character in certain areas of the city.
   (D)   R-1, Single-Family Residential. The purpose of this district is to
accommodate single-family residential uses on generously sized residential lots
of at least one acre. This zone is generally applied on the fringe of built-up
areas of the city, and may act as a buffer to R-E zones.
   (E)   R-2, Single-Family Residential. This district is intended to provide
single-family residential uses on moderately sized, low-density lots of at
least one-half acre.
   (F)   R-3, Single-Family Residential. This district is characterized by
single-family residential development on medium-sized lots of at least 9,600
square feet, with density not exceeding three units/acre. As with other
residential zones, this district also serves as a buffer in providing for a
step-down in intensity from higher to lower density residential and other types
of development. It is the intent and desire of the city that R-3 zoned areas,
which typically have smaller sized lots, be served by municipal water and
sanitary sewer service.
   (G)   R-3-L, Single Family Residential. This district is intended to provide
single-family residential uses on moderately sized, low-density lots of at
least 14,520 square feet, one-third acre.
   (H)   R-4, Single-Family Residential. This district is characterized by
single-family or duplex residential development on medium sized lots of at
least 8,000 square feet, with density not exceeding four units/acre. As with
other residential zones, this district also serves as a buffer in providing for
a step-down in intensity from higher to lower density residential and other
types of development. It is the intent and desire of the city that R-4 zoned
areas, which typically have smaller sized lots, be served by municipal water
and sanitary sewer service. The R-4, Single-Family Residential is not an
available residential zoning district classification for assignment and is only
available for current properties that are assigned to the R-4 zoning district.
   (I)   R-MF-16 Multi-Family Residential. This district is to provide for
multi-family development, and is characterized by traditional apartment-type
units in attached living complexes. Congregate housing for the elderly is also
anticipated in this zone. The maximum density in this district is 16 dwelling
units to the acre. It is the intent and desire of the city that R-MF-16 zoned
areas be served by municipal water and sanitary sewer service.
   (J)   R-MH Manufactured Home/Mobile Home Residential. This district is to
provide for replacement of manufactured home/mobile homes on individually owned
lots. Areas so classified must have all municipal services available. A maximum
density in this district is one unit per acre.
   (K)   Uses permitted.
      (1)   Uses permitted in the residential districts are set forth in the
following table. Where the letter "P" appears opposite a listed use and
underneath a residential district, the use is permitted in that district "by
right" subject to:
         (a)   Providing off-street parking and loading facilities as required
by §
153.210;
         (b)   Providing landscaping and screening as provided by §
153.212; and
         (c)   Conformance with special conditions applying to certain uses as
set forth in §
153.160 et seq.
      (2)   Only one principal structure per lot shall be permitted in R-E, R-
l, R-2, R-3L, R-3, and R-4 single-family districts. In addition to the
accessory uses provided for in §
153.040 et seq., an accessory structure may be permitted for sheltering riding
horses on a residentially zoned lot or parcel with a minimum area of two acres,
provided:
         (a)   The structure is at least 100 feet from adjacent property lines;
         (b)   No more than two horses are kept and sheltered on the property;
and
         (c)   The stall area does not exceed 450 square feet.
      (3)   In A districts, only one principal dwelling structure per lot shall
be permitted.
   (L)   Where the letter "C" appears instead of "P", the use is permitted
subject to acquiring a conditional use permit as set forth in §§
153.120 et seq. Where neither "P" nor "C" appears, and "NP" appears in the
table, the use is not permitted.
   (M)   Uses not listed. When a use is proposed that is not listed in this
chapter, the Planning Official shall recommend the appropriate districts based
on land uses that are similar in size, bulk, and traffic generation. If the
applicant does not agree with this interpretation, he or she may appeal the
interpretation to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

* All concentrated feedlot operations for livestock shall be subject to
conditional use approval.
   (N)   Lot, yard and height regulations. Except as otherwise provided herein,
no lot or yard shall be established or reduced in dimension or area in any
residential district that does not meet the minimum
requirements in the following table; nor shall any building or structure be
erected or enlarged that will cause the maximum lot coverage or maximum height
regulations to be exceeded for such district as set forth in said table. A
listing of supplements and exceptions to these regulations follows the table.
   (O)   Minimum dimension requirements. See
Appendix B.
   (P)   When an existing lot is reduced because of conveyance to a federal,
state or local government for a public purpose, and the remaining area is at
least 75% of the required minimum lot size for the district in which it is
located, then that remaining lot shall be deemed to comply with minimum lot
size requirements.
   (Q)   Utility facilities, using land or an unoccupied building requiring
less than 1,000 square feet of site area, are exempt from minimum lot size
requirements of all districts.
   (R)   Minimum lot size requirements shall not be interpreted as prohibiting
the construction of a single-family residential dwelling unit on a lot that was
legally platted and recorded before the adoption of these regulations. For lots
that are rendered nonconforming, the necessity of obtaining a variance from
such created nonconformity shall not be required as a condition of issuance of
a building permit, provided all setback and other requirements can be met.
   (S)   Residential storage sheds of less than 250 square feet in size are
exempted from setback requirements if:
      (1)   The structure is portable.
      (2)   The structure is maintained in good condition.
      (3)   The area around the structure is maintained in good condition.
   (T)   Certain architectural features may project into required yards
(setback) as follows:
      (1)   Cornices, canopies, eaves, or other architectural features, may
project a distance not to exceed 30 inches.
      (2)   Fire escapes may project a distance not exceeding four-and-a-half
feet from the exterior wall of the building.
      (3)   An uncovered stair and necessary landings may project a distance
not to exceed three feet, provided such stair and landing shall not extend
above the entrance floor of the building except for a railing not exceeding
three feet in height.
      (4)   Bay windows, balconies, and chimneys may project a distance not
exceeding 30 inches, provided that such features do not occupy, in the
aggregate, more than one-third of the length of the building wall on which they
are located.
   (U)   When an existing setback is reduced because of conveyance to a
federal, state or local government for a public purpose, and the remaining
setback is at least 75% of the required minimum setback for the district in
which it is located, then that remaining setback shall be deemed to satisfy
minimum setback requirements.
   (V)   Setback averaging. When a majority of the lots have existing principal
structures on them and the street setbacks of said principal structures are on
lots within the same block, with the same zoning classification and fronting on
the same side of the street, and are less than the required street setback,
applicants shall be allowed to use the "average" street setback on that block.
In such cases, the "average setback" shall be the mean (average) setback of all
developed lots on the same side of the street within the same block as the
subject property and with the same zoning classifications; provided that in no
case shall more than six lots on either side of the subject property be
included in the calculation.
   (W)   Maximum height limitation is 35 feet in all residential zones with the
exception of the A and R-MF-16 districts, where the limitation is 45 feet.
Chimneys, smokestacks, ventilators, cooling and water towers, bulkheads, grain
elevators and silos, utility and flagpoles, belfries, spires and steeples, and
monuments and ornamental towers, may be erected to any height not in conflict
with other city ordinances or federal regulations. Communication towers are
exempt only to the extent authorized through conditional use approval.

§ 153.081 COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General description, commercial districts. Commercial districts are
principally intended for the provision of services and the conduct of business
and retail and wholesale trade essential to support residents within the city
and the surrounding area. Four such districts are established herein to provide
for the diversity of uses and appropriate locations required for the range of
goods and services needed in the city.
   (B)   N-C, Neighborhood Commercial. This district is intended to be embedded
in and serve residential neighborhoods. Home office uses, childcare, and small
retail and service type businesses that will not disrupt the normal and orderly
development of the surrounding area are anticipated. Buildings are to be of
residential character regarding outward appearance.
   (C)   C-1, Light Commercial/Office District. This district is intended to
accommodate administrative, executive, and professional offices and associated
uses, as well as limited retail trade and services designed to serve adjacent
residential neighborhoods, usually of a high or medium density character. Such
districts should generally be limited to collector or arterial street
locations, or other carefully selected areas. Uses with drive-thru service such
as restaurants, banks, and pharmacies shall be planned in a way to minimize
physical and visual impact on the pedestrian realm.
   (D)   C-2, General Commercial District. This purpose of this district is to
provide appropriate locations for commercial and retail uses that are
convenient and serve the needs of the public. This district also provides
locations for limited amounts of merchandise, equipment, and material being
offered for retail sale that are more suitable for storage and display outside
the confines of an enclosed structure. Appropriate locations for this district
are generally along heavily traveled arterial streets, where convenient access
and high visibility exist. However, development of groupings of facilities
shall be encouraged in the future, as opposed to less desirable strip
commercial, such as that that exists along U.S. 412.
   (E)   C-T, Commercial Trades and Services. The purpose of this district is
to provide appropriate locations for commercial uses that do not require high
public visibility and may have a limited manufacturing or ancillary warehouse/
storage component. Some uses may have retail storefronts. Uses such as screened
equipment yards, limited manufacturing, and small warehousing spaces are
anticipated in this zone.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17; Am. Ord. 2021-04-938, passed 4--21)
§ 153.082 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   L-1, Light Industrial. The light industrial zoning district is
intended to provide for the development of light intensity industrial uses and
their related facilities. Certain commercial and other complementary uses are
also permitted. Appropriate standards for the district are designed to assure
compatibility with other similar uses and to minimize any conflicts with non-
industrial uses located in close proximity to industrial uses. Suitable uses in
this district include warehousing, wholesaling, packaging, storage, storage
yards, display and such limited manufacturing as does not create a nuisance for
residential and commercial neighbors. Adequate and suitable transportation
facilities are a necessity to this district. Industrial uses must be screened
from more restrictive uses.
   (B)   I, Industrial. The industrial zoning district is intended to provide
for the development of light to medium intensity industrial uses and their
related facilities. Certain commercial and other complementary uses are also
permitted. Appropriate standards for the district are designed to ensure
compatibility with other similar uses and to minimize any conflicts with non-
industrial uses located in close proximity to industrial uses. Suitable uses in
this district include freight terminals, warehousing, wholesaling, packaging,
storage, storage yards, fabrication, display and such manufacturing as does not
create a nuisance for residential and commercial neighbors. Adequate and
suitable transportation facilities are a necessity to this district. Industrial
uses must be screened from more restrictive uses.

§ 153.083 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES AND EXCLUSIVE USE-LANDFILL USES
PERMITTED.
   (A)   Uses permitted in the foregoing districts are set forth in the
following table. Where the letter "P" appears opposite a listed use and
underneath a district, the use is permitted in that district "by right" subject
to:
      (1)   Providing off-street parking and loading facilities as required by
§
153.210:
      (2)   Providing landscaping and screening as required by §
153.212: and
      (3)   Conformance with special conditions applying to certain uses as set
forth in §
153.160 et seq. Commercial uses must be screened from more restrictive uses.
   (B)   Where the letter "C" appears instead of "P", the use is permitted
subject to acquiring a conditional use permit as set forth in §§
153.120 et seq. Where neither "P" nor "C" appears within the table, and "NP"
appears, the use is not permitted.
   (C)   Uses not listed. When a use is proposed that is not listed in this
chapter, the Building Official shall recommend the appropriate districts based
on land uses that are similar in size, bulk, and traffic generation. If the
applicant does not agree with this interpretation, he or she may appeal the
interpretation to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

§ 153.084 NONRESIDENTIAL LOT, YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   No lot or yard shall be established or reduced in dimension or area in
any nonresidential district that does not meet the minimum requirements in the
table that follows; nor shall any building or structure be erected or enlarged
that will cause the maximum lot coverage or maximum height regulations to be
exceeded for such district as set forth in said table. A listing of supplements
and exceptions to these regulations follows the table.
   (B)   Minimum dimension requirements; non-residential districts. See
Appendix C.
   (C)   Size reduced for public purpose. When an existing lot is reduced
because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public
purpose, and the remaining area is at least 75% of the required minimum lot
size for the district in which it is located, then that remaining lot shall be
deemed to comply with minimum lot size requirements.
   (D)   Utility exemption. Utility facilities, using land or an unoccupied
building requiring less than 1,000 square feet of site area, are exempt from
minimum lot size requirements.
   (E)   Setback reduced for public purpose. When an existing setback is
reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a
public purpose, and the remaining setback is at least 75% of the required
minimum setback for the district in which it is located, then that remaining
setback shall be deemed to satisfy minimum setback requirements.
   (F)   In EU-L, setbacks do not apply when adjacent to property that is
currently operating as a sanitary landfill, and the proposal is for an
expansion of that landfill. The setbacks shall be met for any adjoining
property that is not to be used for a sanitary landfill, or is owned by another
entity or person.
   (G)   Maximum height exclusions. Chimneys, smokestacks, flares, ventilators,
engine exhaust towers, cooling and water towers, bulkheads, grain elevators and
silos, utility and flag poles, belfries, spires and steeples, and monuments and
ornamental towers may be erected to any height not in conflict with the other
city ordinances or federal regulations. Communication towers are exempt only to
the extent authorized through conditional use approval, if such use is not a
use permitted by right.

§ 153.085 OVERLAY AND SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The purpose of overlay and special purpose districts is to provide for
enhanced standards to protect and enhance the unique characteristics of
specific areas and/or corridors, such as natural scenic beauty or manmade
features, while providing for development opportunities. Examples of such
purposes include: promoting the safe and efficient use of specific roadways by
controlling access and other traffic measures; Encouraging the redevelopment of
an area consistent with a particular design theme; giving special attention to
landscaping, buffering, signage, lighting and building setbacks in those
districts identified as needing special attention; and giving special attention
to the existing architectural style or to the style which is planned, so as to
create an easily identifiable area in those areas identified as architecturally
or historically significant.
   (B)   The City Council, upon recommendation from the Planning Commission,
may adopt overlay and special purpose districts as the needs are identified in
order to implement specific purposes, intents, and design standards generally
consistent with the City of Tontitown 2005 Comprehensive Land Use Plan
provisions for the area being regulated, which shall be applied as additional
standards to other city regulations. The development criteria for each district
shall be those standards as set out in each respective district that is
adopted. Such districts shall be made a part of the zoning regulations through
the standard amendment procedures; and upon adoption, the boundaries of such
districts, shall be delineated on the official zoning map.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.086 EXCLUSIVE USE-LANDFILL (EU-L) DISTRICT.
   (A)   General intent. The Exclusive Use-Landfill zoning district is intended
to provide for the development of sanitary landfills and related facilities.
Certain complementary or ancillary uses are also permitted. Appropriate
standards for the district are designed to ensure compatibility and to minimize
any conflicts with all other uses located in close proximity to landfill uses.
Suitable uses in this district include sanitary landfills, transfer stations,
recycling facilities, composting facilities, waste water treatment facilities,
waste solidification, truck or wheel wash, soil borrowing, renewable natural
gas facilities, household hazardous waste facilities, agricultural uses,
wildlife refuge or similar public purpose use, landfill gas to energy
facilities, solar energy facilities, landfill maintenance facilities, waste
hauling facilities and associated maintenance facilities, and compressed
natural gas (CNG) facilities. Adequate and suitable transportation
infrastructure, access, screening, and environmental protections are a
necessity to this district. Landfill uses must be screened from more
restrictive uses as set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Purpose and objective. The purpose and objective of this zone is to
place sanitary landfills in an exclusive use zone in order to establish site
location and design standards which will:
      (1)   Protect public health by preventing water pollution, rodent
infestation, air pollution, or other health hazards and nuisance-causing
activities as would occur as a result of improper location, design or operation
of a landfill.
      (2)   Protect public safety by requiring proper design of access roads to
accommodate the heavy equipment necessary for collection, transportation and
disposal of solid wastes.
      (3)   Promote public welfare by requiring adequate screening and setbacks
in the design and location of a landfill, regular policing and maintenance of
access roads and heavily traveled routes to the site, limiting nuisance-causing
activity, restricting hours of operation, and prudent review of subsequent uses
allowed on the landfill site. All development shall be designed in such a way
as to minimize negative impact on the surrounding area and to protect
surrounding properties from incompatible development.
      (4)   Protect public health and promote public welfare by providing a
suitable location for the disposal of the solid wastes generated by the
community and preserve the nature of the surrounding properties. Existing trees
on a development site shall be retained where possible. Screening, natural
barriers (such as steep slopes, bodies of water, and heavy vegetation), or
other buffers may be required to give adequate separation between uses which
are marginally compatible and shall also be provided for the beautification and
enhancement of the property.
   (C)   Applicability. The requirements and performance standards as herein
provided shall apply to all new sanitary landfills or new expansions of lawful
sanitary landfills. Furthermore, all parties recognize that the Arkansas
Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) or its successor agency is
responsible for issuing permit(s) authorizing and regulating sanitary landfills
pursuant to Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, Regulation No.
22 or future successor agency rules, regulations, or laws. All parties
recognize that the Arkansas legislature has promulgated statutes regulating
solid waste facilities and establishing the Arkansas Pollution Control and
Ecology Commission. Should conflicts exist between ADEQ regulations, Arkansas
law, or City of Tontitown ordinances, the more stringent regulation shall be
imposed to the extent that such regulation is not specifically prohibited or
preempted by federal or state regulations.
   (D)   Principal permitted uses. Sanitary landfill and associated operational
and maintenance facilities.
   (E)   Accessory uses.
      (1)   Transfer stations
      (2)   Recycling facilities
      (3)   Compost facilities
      (4)   Household hazardous waste facilities
      (5)   Agricultural uses
      (6)   Wildlife refuge or similar public purpose use
      (7)   Landfill gas to energy facilities
      (8)   Solar energy facilities
      (9)   Landfill maintenance facilities
      (10)   Waste hauling facilities and associated maintenance facilities
      (11)   Compressed natural gas (CNG) facilities
      (12)   Renewable natural gas facilities
      (13)   Waste solidification pit
      (14)   Waste water treatment facilities
      (15)   Truck or wheel washing facilities
      (16)   Scale facilities
      (17)   Soil borrow site
   (F)   Standards of development. These standards shall apply to all new
landfill uses, new expansions of an existing landfill use, and accessory
landfill uses.
      (1)   Ownership control. The land in a sanitary landfill shall be owned,
leased, or otherwise controlled by a person, firm, group of individuals,
partnership, corporation, or trust, provided assurances are given through the
procedures contained herein that the landfill can be successfully operated and
managed, and is properly permitted by the ADEQ.
      (2)   Site structure requirements.
         (a)   Minimum lot area. There shall be no minimum lot area
requirement, except that a site must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
amount of waste estimated for deposit during the current life or the future
permitted life of the landfill.
         (b)   Minimum lot width. 100 feet.
         (c)   Setback requirements. The principal permitted use, including all
activities related to operation of the principal permitted use, shall meet the
following minimum setback requirements, unless adjacent to other property
currently being used as sanitary landfill:
            1.   Front yard setback      100 feet
            2.   Rear yard setback      100 feet for nonresidential uses, 250
feet for residential uses (including residential and agricultural zoned
properties)
            3.   Side yard setback      100 feet for nonresidential uses, 250
feet for residential uses (including residential and agricultural zoned
properties)
            4.   Maximum building height   45 feet

landfill use or existing approved expansion. All accessory uses, buildings and/
or structures, or site modification beyond the approved boundaries of
disturbance for the primary landfill use or existing approved expansion
(including, but not limited to, parking lots, modification to detention ponds,
etc.) except those as set forth in divisions (E)(5) and (E)(6) above, shall
meet the same large scale development site and structure requirements as
principal permitted uses and shall be set out in the application, and shall
require large scale development review and approval.
         (e)   Access. In order to protect the public health, safety, welfare,
and the surrounding environment, public access shall be controlled to prevent
unauthorized entry or vehicular traffic by using artificial barriers, natural
barriers, or both, as appropriate. An adequate fence with a gate that can be
locked must be provided at the entrance to the facility.
         (f)   Litter control. Litter control provisions shall be maintained at
all times. If daily or more frequent cover does not control on- and off-site
litter, other methods may be required, such as, but not limited to litter
fences and litter crews. Litter screening fences will be provided near the
landfill working face to prevent the spread of paper and other litter.
         (g)   Screening. Screening shall be provided so that the landfill is
minimally visible to any residential or commercial structure, or from any
public street. Screening can include a combination of fencing, vegetation, or
other provisions which shall accomplish the same.
         (h)   Sign and directions. Necessary identification and directional
signs shall be provided. A sign shall be posted at the entrances to inform the
public of the hours of operation, charges for disposal, and rules and
regulations regarding disposal. All new signage shall comply with regulations
found in §
153.180. Modifications and additions to signage that are not considered regular
maintenance shall conform to regulations found in §
153.180. Interior site signage shall be provided that directs users to the
appropriate unloading area.

temporary projects, such as construction, maintenance, or emergencies, may
temporarily spill over onto adjacent properties or inhibit the night sky. All
lighting shall comply with regulations found in §
152.150.
         (j)   Excessive noise. No equipment that causes excessive noise
(beeping, honking, banging, dumping, heavy engine sounds, or other) shall cause
disturbance to residents of neighboring properties between the hours of 9:00
p.m. and 5:00 a.m. Monday-Saturday, except for emergencies may temporarily be
allowed outside the above hours. No excessive noise shall be allowed on Sunday
except for emergencies may temporarily be allowed outside the above hours.
         (k)   Parking. One space per employee shall be required plus one space
per 500 square feet of office space.
         (l)   Buffer. The landfill shall be adequately buffered on all sides
between the footprint of the permitted or planned waste disposal area and the
perimeter boundary of the property so as to offset fugitive dust, noise,
vibration and visual impact to adjacent property. All screening and buffering
shall be completed on site. The buffer areas shall be landscaped and graded
consistent with the approved site plan.

§ 153.087 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT.
   (A)   General description. It is the intent of this section to encourage
development with superior living environments brought about through unified
development, and to provide for the application of design ingenuity in such
developments, while protecting existing and future surrounding areas in
achieving the goals of the comprehensive plan for development of the city. The
PUD provisions herein established are intended to provide for greater
flexibility in the design of buildings, yards, courts, circulation and open
space than would otherwise be possible through the strict application of other
district regulations, and to produce:
      (1)   A maximum choice in the type of environment and living units
available to the public;
      (2)   Open space and recreation areas;
      (3)   A pattern of development which preserves natural features, prevents
soil erosion, and protects water quality;
      (4)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development;
      (5)   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets, and thereby lowering costs; and
      (6)   An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding
development.
   (B)   The PUD regulations are designed to provide for small- and large-scale
developments incorporating a single type or a variety of residential,
commercial, and related uses that are planned and developed as a unit. Such
development may consist of individual lots or it may have common building
sites. Private or public common land and open space should be an essential and
major element of the plan that is related to and affects the long-term value of
the homes and other development. A planned unit shall be a separate entity with
a distinct character and be in harmony with surrounding development.
   (C)   Standards of development.
      (1)   Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development district
(PUD) shall be owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by a person, firm, group
of individuals, partnership, corporation, or trust, provided assurances are
given through the procedures contained herein that the project can be
successfully completed.
      (2)   Minimum district area. The minimum area for a PUD district shall be
two acres. In calculating the minimum area for a PUD district, the measurements
shall include the area of all dedicated streets entirely within the boundary of
the proposed PUD, and one-half of the area of all boundary or perimeter
streets.
      (3)   Uses permitted. In order to increase creativity and flexibility in
the development of areas suitable for a planned unit development, there are no
specifically prescribed uses that are permitted within the boundaries of a
planned unit development. The developer shall be responsible for preparation of
a list of permitted uses within the specific planned unit development
requested. The development list shall take into account the nature and purpose
of the PUD area, and such uses and locations shall be appropriate in order to
protect and be in harmony with surrounding development.
      (4)   At the time of the pre-application plan and conference, the
applicant shall generally describe the nature and types of land uses to be
located within the boundaries of the PUD district. At the time of zoning
application and consideration of the preliminary plat, a specific written list
of uses to be "permitted by right" shall be submitted for review by the
Planning Commission. If approved by the Planning Commission and City Council,
the list of specific uses permitted by right shall serve as the control list in
issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy.
      (5)   In addition to the above permitted uses that are established by
right, certain other uses may be prescribed by the developer in accordance with
the restrictions included herein and said uses are designated as conditional
uses. These uses more intensely dominate the area in which they are located
than do other uses which might be permitted in the PUD district and, as such,
they require special considerations and restrictions. If the developer and/or
Planning Commission agree that certain conditional uses should be included
within the PUD district, the applicant shall precisely indicate the specific
use, its location, area to be included, maximum building square footage, and
such other information as required by the Planning Commission to properly and
comprehensively evaluate the nature and impact of such conditional uses. When
such conditional uses are approved at the time of rezoning, they shall not be
subsequently changed to any other use until and unless they are changed to
another use that is permitted by right, or the new proposed use if not
permitted by right in a PUD district, is resubmitted for rezoning approval.
      (6)   Parking and off-street loading. All uses established with a planned
unit development district shall comply with the off-street parking and loading
requirements as established in the city's zoning regulations and street section
requirements within the city's Adopted Future Land Use Plan and Master Street
Plan. However, the requirements for individual structures or lots may be met
through either provision of adequate parking on the lot on which such structure
is so located, or upon adjacent property which is under the control of a
property owners' association, to which said lot is an automatic participant. In
no case, however, shall the cumulative requirements of all parking and off-
street loading requirements be less than if said uses were individually
established and located in any other zoning district within the city.
      (7)   Perimeter requirements. In order to assure compatibility with
surrounding development, the developer shall submit specific information as to
the setbacks, building height, coverage factors and other elements necessary
for all perimeter lots that are adjacent to the boundary of the PUD district or
adjacent to any boundary or perimeter street right-of-way. While no specific
setback requirements are herein established, the Planning Board shall consider
the nature, extent and character of the adjacent development and shall take
into consideration the types of area regulations applicable to adjacent
properties.
      (8)   Residential density standards. The maximum number of dwelling units
permitted within a PUD district is dependent upon both the type and number of
each type of residential units intended to be included in the PUD district.
Densities within certain areas of the PUD may be beyond the overall limits
through a transfer of density. However, overall project densities shall not be
exceeded in accordance with the following schedule:
         (a)   Eight dwelling units per net residential acre for single-family
attached and detached houses and duplexes.
         (b)   Fifteen dwelling units per net residential acre for triplexes,
fourplexes, and row or terrace housing.
         (c)   Eighteen dwelling units per net residential acre for two story,
and 27 units per net residential acre for three-story apartments.
         (d)   Forty dwelling units per net residential acre for high-rise
(four stories or more) apartments.
         (e)   For purposes of calculating densities, net residential acres are
defined as gross acres of the PUD site minus all public rights-of-ways, and
less the area of all parcels or lots devoted to commercial, industrial, or
institutional uses not of a residential nature.
         (f)   Common open space that is owned and maintained by a property
owners' association shall be included in calculating the residential acres
available for all dwelling units that automatically belong to such an
association. Where more than one property owners' association is to be created,
then each common open space can only be attributed to the lot or dwellings
which have automatic membership for that specific common open area.
      (9)   Green space and lawn space. 
         (a)   Green space and lawn space constitutes an essential ingredient
in a planned unit development and is one of the most basic and important design
elements. Green space and lawn space should be distributed more or less
equitably throughout the PUD district in relationship to the dwelling units and
other use areas that are intended to be served by the green space and lawn
space. Adequate guarantees must be provided that the green space and lawn space
areas as contained in the plan for the PUD district are preserved and
maintained for those purposes only. A minimum of 20% of the total project area
shall be devoted to green space and lawn space. The percentage of the required
green space and lawn space shall be calculated from the total acreage of the
development.
         (b)   At least 3% of the project total shall be designated common
space. Common space may be included as part of the 20% required green space and
lawn space. Example: 80 acre raw tract of land, 20% green space and lawn space
= 16 acres green space and lawn space, at least 2.4 acres must be common space.
Common space may include the following:
            1.   Public plazas and hard surfaced recreation areas including,
but not limited to, pools, basketball courts, tennis courts, bocce courts,
soccer fields, weight rooms, clubhouses, baseball fields or similar outdoor
recreation facilities, and associated parking, that are open to the residents
and users of the PUD.
            2.   Pedestrian paths, trails, and covered walkways, excluding
those required in rights-of-ways and along private drives.
            3.   Wetlands and water bodies, including the normal water surface
area of retention ponds that hold water, if assessable by property owners
within the PUD. Dry detention ponds shall not be included.
            4.   Vegetated/landscaped areas. A property owners' association
shall be required, if other arrangements satisfactory to the Planning
Commission have not been made, for improving, operating and maintaining all
such common open space areas. At the time the plan and plat are submitted, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the property owners' association shall
be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission. Additionally, the
restrictive covenants which run with the land must be submitted and include
similar provisions to preserve all green space and lawn space areas.
   (D)   Procedures for obtaining PUD zoning. A three-step review procedure is
required for obtaining PUD zoning and final approval of the final plan and
plat. The first step involves a pre-application plan and conference which is
designed to provide information to the city of the developer's intention with
respect to the nature and scope of the proposed PUD district, and to allow the
developer to be informed of the city's regulations and policies concerning
development alternatives for the area. The second step involves submission of a
formal application for rezoning of the area to a PUD district and simultaneous
submission of a preliminary plat in accordance with the city's subdivision
regulations. The last step involves submission of the final development plan
and plat for approval and recording prior to commencing building construction.
These steps are outlined as follows with respect to the procedure followed and
submission requirements at each step:
      (1)   Pre-application plan and conference.
         (a)   Procedure.
            1.   A pre-application plan shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for review of the area and proposed uses relative to the
compatibility of a planned unit development project with existing development
in the surrounding area and the comprehensive development plan of the city.
            2.   Each applicant shall confer with the zoning official and
interested Department heads in connection with the preparation of the planned
unit development application. It shall be the responsibility of the zoning
official to contact and invite interested department heads and other parties to
a joint meeting. The general outlines of the proposal, evidenced schematically
by the pre-application plan and such other information as may be desired, are
to be considered before submission of the planned unit development application.
            3.   Upon review of the site plan and general area, and following
completion of the pre-application conference, the zoning official shall furnish
the applicant with written comments regarding the conference, including
appropriate recommendations to inform and assist the applicant prior to
preparing the components of the planned unit development application.
         (b)   Submission requirements. At the time of requesting a pre-
application conference, the applicant shall submit a scaled site plan and such
other narrative or graphic information the applicant deems pertinent to the
city's initial review and evaluation of the potential of the PUD district
proposed. The pre-application plan shall include the following:
            1.   Boundaries of the property involved;
            2.   Existing zoning of the area and zoning of adjoining
properties;
            3.   Existing roadways, easements, and waterways;
            4.   Indication of availability of all utilities; and
            5.   General plan of development at a level of detail sufficient to
indicate to the city the nature and scope of the project as to its magnitude in
terms of approximate number and types of dwelling units; location and extent of
nonresidential elements; proposed locations of major open space areas; and
circulation and access.
      (2)   Zoning application and preliminary plat. After receiving written
comments following the pre-application conference, the applicant may proceed in
preparing a formal application for a planned unit development to the Planning
Commission. The application shall consist of a simultaneous submission of a
preliminary plat and a rezoning application. The preliminary plat shall conform
to all requirements contained in the subdivision regulations with the exception
of certain design requirements regarding lots, setbacks, and the like that are
specifically exempted or modified by provisions of this chapter. The rezoning
application shall be processed following the procedure for map amendments.
         (a)   Submission requirements. The applicant shall simultaneously
submit both a preliminary plat and a rezoning application. To form the basis
for the rezoning application, a preliminary plat shall be submitted and it
shall include all requirements for the preliminary plat and include the
following information:
            1.   Proposed title of the project and name of any engineer,
architect, land planner, land surveyor, landscape architect, or company
responsible for various elements of the plan;
            2.   North point, graphic scale, and date;
            3.   Boundaries of the properties involved, all existing easements,
section lines and property lines, existing streets, existing buildings,
watercourses, waterways or lakes, and other existing physical features in and
adjoining the property;
            4.   Location and sizes of sanitary and storm sewers, water mains,
culverts and other underground structures in and adjacent to the project;
            5.   Topography of the project area with appropriate contour
intervals;
            6.   General land use development plan of the area, indicating:
               a.   The location of different land uses;
               b.   Dwellings by types and numbers;
               c.   Areas designated for commercial uses and other
nonresidential uses; and
               d.   Areas proposed for open space and recreational use.
               e.   For all residential areas, the site plan shall clearly
indicate the type and number of dwellings to be located per parcel, lot or
block in accordance with the preliminary plat;
               f.   For all commercial or other nonresidential uses, the areas
shall clearly be indicated in accordance with lots, parcels, or blocks and each
such parcel shall indicate the type of building proposed, number of stores, and
gross square footage to be included on each parcel;
               g.   The boundaries of all open space areas shall be clearly
indicated along with the form of proposed ownership, that is by property
owners' association or public park or other legal entity, and in such case
where more than one property owners' association is being created,
documentation shall be clearly submitted as to which areas will have automatic
membership into said associations;
               h.   This requirement, however, shall not be interpreted as
requiring a detailed site development plan that includes the exact boundaries
and locations of all structures proposed for construction.
               i.   The location of different land uses, dwellings by types and
numbers, areas designated for commercial uses and other nonresidential uses,
and areas proposed for open space and recreational use. For all residential
areas, the site plan shall clearly indicate the type and number of dwellings to
be located per parcel, lot or block in accordance with the preliminary plat.
For all commercial or other nonresidential uses, the areas shall clearly be
indicated in accordance with lots, parcels, or blocks and each such parcel
shall indicate the type of building proposed, number of stories, and gross
square footage to be included on each parcel. The boundaries of all open space
areas shall be clearly indicated along with the form of proposed ownership,
that is, by property owners' association or public park or other legal entity,
and in such case where more than one property owners' association is being
created, documentation shall be clearly submitted as to which areas will have
automatic membership into said associations. This requirement, however, shall
not be interpreted as requiring a detailed site development plan that includes
the exact boundaries and locations of all structures proposed for construction.
            7.   All setback lines for all properties shall be shown;
            8.   If the project is to be developed in more than one phase, the
boundaries of each proposed phase shall be clearly indicated on the site plan
map;
            9.   Calculations shall be submitted of the total number of gross
acres in the project, and the acres and percentage thereof, proposed to be
devoted to the several dwelling types, commercial uses, other nonresidential
uses, streets, parks, schools, and other reservations; and
            10.   Tabulation of the total number of dwelling units by various
types in the project, and the total number of net residential acres within the
project.
         (b)   The tabulations shall so indicate conformance of the proposed
project, or each phase within the project, to the residential density standards
for the PUD district.
      (3)   Final plan and plat. Upon approval of the rezoning request by the
City Council, the applicant may proceed with the preparation of the final plan
and plat. The final plat shall meet all applicable requirements of the city's
subdivision regulations and shall be processed in accordance with those
regulations. The applicant shall submit a written and graphic description of
any modifications made to the final plan from the approved preliminary plan. If
it is determined that no changes have been made from the preliminary plan, or
if only minor plan changes have been made in accordance with the definition
provided herein below, then the review by the Planning Commission may proceed
and the plat may be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval. If
approved, the plat shall be filed in the office of the Washington County
Circuit Clerk.
   (E)   Amendments. Amendments may be required either to the preliminary site
plan, or the final development plan. The procedure governing the disposition of
amendments shall be as follows:
      (1)   Amendments to preliminary plan. At the time a final plan is
submitted for review, it shall be determined whether or not any amendments have
been made to the approved preliminary plan. If amendments have been made, then
a determination shall be required as to whether or not said amendments
constitute a major or minor plan change. Modifications from the previously
approved preliminary plan shall be deemed to be minor plan changes if any and
all modifications by the applicant of the plan do not:
         (a)   Vary the total number of dwelling units by more than 5%;
         (b)   Involve a reduction of the area set aside for common open space
or the substantial relocation of such area or areas;
         (c)   Increase by more than 5% the total floor area proposed for any
nonresidential use; and
         (d)   Does not substantially change the location of any nonresidential
areas as shown on the preliminary plan.
      (2)   Additionally, modifications in the location or design of minor
streets, cul-de-sacs, alleys, or facilities for water and for disposal of storm
water and sanitary sewage shall not be considered as major modifications. All
other changes in the planned unit development, including changes in the site
plan and development schedule, must be made under the procedures that are
applicable to the initial approval of a planned unit development.
      (3)   Amendments to final development plan. The final development plan as
submitted and approved may be amended in accordance with the following
procedure. Minor changes may be authorized by the zoning official, in such
cases where changes are required by engineering or other circumstances not
foreseen at the time the final development plan was approved. No change
authorized by the zoning official under this section, however, may either
increase the total area devoted to any and all nonresidential uses, or decrease
the amount of area devoted to common open space, or increase the total number
of dwelling units located on any lot, block, or parcel as approved in the final
development plan. Notwithstanding any of these conditions, the zoning official
may not permit changes beyond the minimum or maximum requirements set forth in
these regulations. All other changes in the planned unit development, including
changes in the site plan or the development schedule, must be made under the
procedures that are applicable to the initial approval of a planned unit
development.
      (4)   Administration and enforcement.
         (a)   Review standards. The Planning Commission shall investigate and
ascertain that the plans for a planned unit development meet the following
conditions:
            1.   That the tract of land for the entire project comprises not
less than two acres.
            2.   That the project is in conformity with the requirements and
standards of development of the planned unit development district and is
consistent with the intent and purpose of this section.
            3.   That the proposed project constitutes an environment of
sustained desirability and stability, and that it is in harmony with the
character of the surrounding neighborhood, and is not inconsistent with the
city's comprehensive plan.
            4.   That the property adjacent to the proposed development will
not be adversely affected.
         (b)   Recorded plat and plot plan required. The proposed development
shall follow all applicable procedures, standards, regulations, and laws
governing the subdivision of land. No building permit for any structure shall
be issued until a final plat of the proposed development, or part thereof, is
approved and recorded and an approved plot plan is submitted in accordance with
these regulations.
         (c)   1.   Phasing and development schedule. The applicant shall
clearly indicate on the site plan map, the boundaries of each proposed phase.
If the sequence of construction of various portions of the development is to
occur in phases or stages, then the open space and/or recreational facilities
should be developed or committed thereto in proportion to the number of
dwelling units intended to be developed during any given stage of construction.
            2.   Additionally, the applicant shall submit a schedule of
construction for the project, or for each phase within the project, indicating
the sequence of development according to residential type and other
nonresidential construction within the project. Upon adoption of the schedule
of construction, the building inspector shall be responsible for enforcing this
schedule. If the building inspector determines that the rate of construction of
residential units or nonresidential structures differs from the construction
schedule, he shall so notify the developer in writing. Thereafter, the building
inspector may issue such orders to a developer as necessary to correct said
schedule, and upon continued violation of this subsection may suspend the
developer from further construction of dwelling units or nonresidential
structures until compliance is achieved.
         (d)   Guarantee of completion. Before approval of the final
development plan, the Planning Commission shall require a contract with
safeguards satisfactory to the Commission guaranteeing completion of the
development plan for any single phase in a period to be specified by the
Commission, but which period shall not exceed five years unless extended by the
Commission.
         (e)   Causes for revocation. The Planning Commission may recommend to
the City Council that any previous planned unit development approval be
revoked, and all building permits be voided under the following circumstances:
            1.   If the applicant has not submitted a final development plan to
the city within one year of preliminary plat approval. Where an optional staged
development plan is utilized, the affected portion of the approved preliminary
plan may be revoked in its entirety or to the extent of that portion on which a
final development plat has not been submitted and approved.
            2.   If no building permit has been issued within one year from the
recording date of the final development plan map, or initial plan of a staged,
final development plan and the applicant has not been granted an extension.
            3.   If the applicant does not adhere to the phased development
schedule as stated in the approved preliminary development plan. If the
construction and provision of all common open spaces and public and
recreational facilities which are shown on the final development plan map are
proceeding at a substantially slower rate than other project components. From
time to time, the Planning Commission shall compare the actual development
accomplished with the approved development schedule. If the commission finds
that the rate of construction of dwelling units or other structures is
substantially greater than the rate at which common open spaces and public
recreational facilities have been constructed and provided, then the Planning
Commission may initiate revocation action or cease to approve any additional
final development plans/plats if preceding phases have not been finalized. The
city may also issue a stop work order or discontinue issuance of building
permits, or revoke those previously issued.

CONDITIONAL USES
§ 153.120 NATURE AND DESCRIPTION.
   Certain uses may or may not be appropriately located within various
districts due to their unusual or unique characteristics of operation and
external effects. Given their unusual character, analysis and judgment of the
consequences of each development and use must be given so as to provide for
such reasonable conditions and protective restrictions as are deemed necessary
to protect the character and integrity of the area in which uses are proposed
to be located. Such uses are listed under the various districts herein as
"conditional uses," and may be located in the district or districts so
designated only in accordance with the procedure described herein.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.121 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND REVIEW GUIDELINES.
   (A)   All development shall be designed in such a way as to minimize any
potential negative impact on the surrounding area. Special attention shall be
given to buffering commercial developments from adjacent single-family areas.
Design of the internal traffic circulation system, ingress and egress, off-
street parking, loading and pedestrian ways shall be sensitive to such
conditions as safety, convenience, separation of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, general attractiveness, and the proper relationship of different land
uses. Landscaped areas shall be provided to protect water quality, and reduce
erosion, heat and glare. Such areas shall be maintained in an attractive
condition. Existing trees on a development site shall be retained where
possible. Screening, open space, or other buffer may be required to give
adequate separation between uses which are marginally compatible, and shall
also be provided for the beautification and enhancement of the property.
   (B)   In carrying out the purpose of this section, the following development
standards and design specifics shall be subject to review and approval. The
appropriateness of these standards shall be determined for each specific
conditional use location.
      (1)   The proposed use is within the provision of "conditional uses," as
set out in these regulations.
      (2)   The proposed use conforms to all applicable provisions herein set
out for the district in which it is to be located.
      (3)   The proposed use is so designated, located, and proposed to be
operated, that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected.
      (4)   The proposed land use is compatible with and will not adversely
affect other property in the area where it is proposed to be located.
      (5)   The size and shape of the site, including the size, shape and
arrangement of proposed structures, as well as signage related thereto, is in
keeping with the intent of these regulations.
      (6)   The proposed ingress and egress, internal circulation system,
location and amount of off street parking, loading and pedestrian ways are
sufficiently adequate, and not inconsistent with requirements of these
regulations.
      (7)   The proposed landscaping and screening of the proposed use are in
accordance with provisions of these regulations.
      (8)   Safeguards proposed to limit noxious or offensive emissions,
including lighting, noise, glare, dust and odor are addressed.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.122 PROCEDURE FOR AUTHORIZING.
    The following procedure is established to properly integrate a conditional
use with other land uses located in the district. These uses shall be reviewed
and authorized or rejected under the following procedure:
   (A)   Application. An application shall be made by the property owner and
filed with the zoning official, upon forms prescribed for that purpose,
accompanied with the appropriate fee established by the City Council to defray
processing costs. The application shall be accompanied by a graphic
representation showing the location and proposed use of the site, along with
such other descriptive material necessary for decision-making. Such may
include, but is not limited to: preliminary site plans showing proposed uses
and structures; proposed ingress and egress to the site, including adjacent
streets; proposed off-street parking and landscaping; lighting and signage; a
preliminary plan for provision of sanitation and drainage facilities; and
proximity of adjacent uses and buildings.
      (1)   Each application shall be verified by at least one of the owners of
the property proposed to be changed, attesting to the truth and correctness of
all facts and information presented with the application.
      (2)   The filing deadline for inclusion on the Planning Commission agenda
shall be the 1st Tuesday of the month prior to the Planning Commission meeting,
which is held on the 4th Tuesday of the month.
   (B)   (1)   Notice. Upon determining that an application is proper and
complete, the zoning official shall insure that the matter is set for public
hearing before the Planning Commission. The zoning official shall be
responsible for insuring that, pursuant to law, at least 15 days' notice of the
time, place, and subject of such hearing is published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city.
      (2)   The applicant shall present evidence to the zoning official, at
least ten days prior to the required public hearing, that all property owners
within 200 feet of the boundaries of the subject property have been notified of
the proposed use, and of the time, date, and place of the hearing. Such
evidence shall consist of postmarked, certified receipts and/or return
receipts.
   (C)   (1)   Planning Commission review and action. The Planning Commission
shall review conditional use permit applications at its regularly scheduled
monthly meeting, at which time interested persons may appear at the required
public hearing and offer information in support of or against the proposed
conditional use. Following the public hearing, the Commission may recommend
that the City Council approve the application as presented, recommend that the
City Council approve the application with conditions, table the application
with cause for not to exceed one month, or deny the application. A
recommendation for approval or approval with conditions shall require an
affirmative vote of a majority of the authorized membership of the Planning
Commission. Following a recommendation to approve the application or approve
the application with conditions, the Planning Commission shall forward the
application and recommendation to the City Council and the City Council shall
have the final authority to accept the recommendation, to accept the
recommendation with additional conditions, table the application with cause for
not to exceed one month, or to deny the application.
      (2)   In approving such conditional uses, the Planning Commission and
City Council shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises as
it deems necessary to reduce or minimize the adverse effects of the use.
Compatibility with surrounding property shall be insured to the maximum extent
practicable. If the Planning Commission or City Council denies a conditional
use application, the reasons for such action shall be given to the applicant
within 15 days from the date of the decision. If denied by the City Council, no
application for such use or similar use shall be permitted involving part of
the same property for a period of six months.
   (D)   A petitioner aggrieved by an action to approve or deny an application
by the Planning Commission shall file an appeal to the City Council with the
City Clerk. The appeal most filed with the City Clerk within ten business days
after the decision has been rendered by the Planning Commission. The appeal
shall consist of a letter from the aggrieved party which sets forth the reasons
for the appeal, any other necessary information, as well as the payment of any
required fee. The City Council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of
the appeal.
   (E)   In no case, shall the Planning Commission or City Council authorize
reduction from minimum requirements of these regulations relating to height,
area, setbacks, parking, or landscaping. In addition, no conditional use
authorized by the Planning Commission or City Council shall be subsequently
considered in connection with a variance request to the Board of Zoning
Adjustment.

2021-1-908, passed 1-5-21; Am. Ord. 2023-06-1054, passed 6--23)
§ 153.123 EFFECT OF APPROVAL.
   (A)   No building permit shall be issued for any building or structure not
in conformance with the site plan and all other conditions imposed in granting
a conditional use permit. The construction, location, use, or operation of all
land and structures within the site shall be in accordance with all conditions
and limitations set forth in the approval. No structure, use or other element
of any approved site plan shall be eliminated, significantly altered, or
provided in another manner unless an amendment to the conditional use is
approved. The procedure for amending a conditional use permit shall be the same
as required for the original approval.
   (B)   Substantial work or construction under a conditional use permit must
be commenced within one year, or the permit shall terminate. Conditional use
permits shall be valid for an unlimited period unless a lesser period shall be
provided in a particular permit. Upon the expiration of the time limit
specified in the particular permit, the property owner may request that the
permit be reviewed by the Planning Commission, which may extend it for an
unlimited period or for an additional period of years.
   (C)   Once any portion of the conditional use permit authorization is
utilized, all such conditions pertaining to such authorization shall become
immediately operative. All conditions relating to or limiting the use, status,
or operation of the development, after issuance of an occupancy permit, shall
be complied with by the applicant or his successors or assigns. Failure to do
so shall constitute a violation of these regulations, and cause for revocation
of the conditional use authorization.
   (D)   Provided sufficient site information is submitted with the approved
development plan, the Planning Commission may waive otherwise mandated site
plan review requirements.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
ACCESSORY USES
§ 153.140 GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
   An accessory building is a subordinate building or a portion of the
principal building, the use of which is customarily incidental to that of the
dominant use of the principal building or land. An accessory use is one that is
customarily incidental, appropriate and subordinate to the principal use of
land and buildings, and located upon the same lot therewith. Subject to
limitations herein, accessory buildings and uses are permitted in all zones.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.141 LOCATION REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   An accessory building shall not be located within a required street
(front or street side) setback; shall be subject to all setback standards of
the underlying zoning district; shall not be located within any public easement
or over any known utilities or septic system lines. Accessory buildings, in all
zones, shall not exceed the gross floor area of the principal use or as noted
below, as long as the zoning district listed meets minimum lot size. Unless
otherwise provided herein, and provided site visibility is not obstructed,
signs, fences and walls shall be allowed within setbacks.

purpose of evaluating whether the proposed utilization of land for a vehicular
wrecking or junkyard properly minimizes its objectionable characteristics, the
standards established below shall be used.

to one vertical foot. Berms shall be vegetated. The vegetation plans shall be
submitted for review and approval by the Planning Official.
      (3)   Chain link (even with screening cloth or slats), barbed wire,
corrugated metal, and other agricultural type fencing is not allowed to be used
as a physical screening barrier.

§ 153.182 SIGNS AUTHORIZED IN EVERY DISTRICT.
   The following provisions sets forth signs that are authorized by §
153.181(A)(2) above in every district.
   (A)   Government signs. This code does not apply to signs erected,
maintained or posted by the state, federal or this government, but the
regulations in this code clarify that government signs are allowed in every
zoning district of the city which form the expression of this government when
erected and maintained and include the signs described herein below when
erected and maintained pursuant to law.
      (1)   Traffic control. Traffic control devices on private or public
property are allowed to be erected and maintained in order to provide for
public safety and in order to comply with the traffic control laws of the State
of Arkansas and the city, as well as the manual on uniform traffic control
devices adopted by the Federal Highway Administration.
      (2)   Public interest signs. Public interest signs of a non-commercial
nature and in the public interest, erected by or on the order of a public
officer in the performance of their duty, such as public notices, safety signs,
danger signs, trespassing signs, traffic and street signs, memorial plaques and
signs of historical, environmental or local interest.
      (3)   Street numbers. Each property owner must mark their property using
numerals that identify the address of the property so that public safety
departments can easily identify the address from the public street. Where
required under this code or other law the identification must be on the curb
and may be on the principal building on the property. The size and location of
the identifying numerals and letters if any must be proportional to the size of
the building and the distance from the street to the building and in no case
larger than four square feet. In cases where the building is not located within
view of the public street, the identifier must be located on the mailbox or
other suitable device such that it is visible from the street.
      (4)   Required postings by law. Where a federal, state or local law
requires a property owner to post a sign on the owner's property to warn of a
danger or to prohibit access to the property either generally or specifically,
the owner must comply with the federal, state or local law to exercise that
authority by posting a sign on the property. The size of such signs should be
no larger than 16 square feet or the minimum size required by law. No more than
two such signs are allowed, or the minimum amount of signs that are required by
law.
      (5)   Flags. A flag may be displayed as provided under the law that
adopts or regulates its use and as provided in division (E) below.
      (6)   Public safety. The signs described in divisions (A)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section are an important component of measures necessary to protect the
public safety and serve the compelling governmental interest of protecting
traffic safety, serving the requirements of emergency response and protecting
property rights or the rights of persons on property.
      (7)   Construction signs. Government sign placards and other signs
required by state and/or federal law to be displayed during construction or
remodeling of buildings, or other site/infrastructure work.
   (B)   Temporary signs.
      (1)   Temporary signage. Temporary signs are allowed at any:
         (a)   A property owner may place signage with sign face square footage
not to exceed 16 square feet on the property at anytime.
         (b)   A property owner may place one sign no larger than 16 square
feet in one window on the property at any time.
      (2)   Temporary signs during elections. Temporary signs may be located on
the owner's property for a period of 60 days prior to any federal, state or
local election that represents the district in which the property is located or
involves an issue on the ballot of an election within the district where the
property is located. All such temporary signs shall be removed within three
days after the election has occurred.
      (3)   Temporary signs during times when a property is for sale. One
temporary sign may be located on a property when the following conditions are
all met:
         (a)   The owner consents and that property is being offered for sale
through a licensed real estate agent.
         (b)   1.   If not offered for sale through a real estate agent, when
the sign is owned by the property owner and that property is offered for sale
by the owner through advertising in a newspaper, online newspaper or in another
public manner.
            2.   If more than one properties are simultaneously offered for
sale, application may be made to install fewer, and larger, signs to serve the
adjacent properties offered for sale. Such sign(s) may be of a size and number
to serve the total area of properties offered for sale. The Code Official shall
determine the number and size of the sign(s) allowed when properties are
combined for this purpose, but in no event shall such a sign(s) exceed 80
square feet in size.
         (c)   For a period of 15 days following the date on which a contract
of sale has been executed by a person purchasing the property.
      (4)   Temporary signs during times when a property is open to the public.
One temporary sign may be located per entrance (from private/public road) on
the owner's property on a day when the property owner is opening the property
to the public during duration of seasonal openings; such sign shall not exceed
12 square feet in size and should be removed after the seasonal opening or
other temporary opening is complete.
      (5)   Temporary signs for new business openings. One temporary sign may
be located per entrance from the road on the owner's property on a day when the
property owner is opening the property/business to the public; allowed for 90
days. Such sign shall not exceed 16 square feet in size.
      (6)   Temporary signs during holiday periods. During the 40 day period
December 1 to January 10, a property owner may place temporary signs on the
property and may use lights between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. CST
to decorate the property even if the lights might be arranged to form a sign.
Further, a property owner may place and maintain temporary signs on their
property on July 4th of every year.
      (7)   Temporary sign limitations. It is the intent of this code to limit
the aesthetic impact of signs on properties in order to prevent unsightly
clutter, protect streetscapes, preserve property values and to promote traffic
safety. The unregulated accumulation of signs adversely affects these goals,
property values and public safety, and so accordingly a person exercising the
right to place temporary signs on a property as described in this division (B)
must limit the number of temporary signs on the property per 0.25 acre at any
one time to two plus a sign allowed in division (B)(1)(b), or if the property
is smaller than 0.25 acres then no more than two signs plus a sign allowed in
division (B)(1)(b) per principal building on the property unless a court having
jurisdiction determines that additional signs must be permitted and then the
signage must be limited to the fewest signs and the smallest accumulated sign
area permissible under the court's determination.
      (8)   Sign face limitation. The sign face of any temporary sign, unless
otherwise limited in this division (B) must not be larger than 16 square feet.
   (C)   Lessors. For purposes of this division, a lessor of a property is
considered the property owner as to the property if the lessor holds a right to
use exclusive of others (or the sole right to occupy). If there are multiple
lessors of a property then each lessor must have the same rights and duties as
the property owner as to the property the lessor leases and has the sole right
to occupy and the size of the property must be deemed to be the property that
the lessor has the sole right to occupy under the lease.
   (D)   Signs not in view. Signs not otherwise prohibited in §
153.181, and which are not exposed to view from a public street or public
right-of-way, public place or other property, shall not be regulated by the
code.
   (E)   Flags. Flags shall be permitted on properties as follows:
      (1)   Single-family zoning districts. In a single-family zoning district
(such as the zones currently recognized in the city: R-E Estate Single-Family
Residential, R-1 Single-Family Residential, R-2 Single Family Residential, R-
3 Single-Family Residential, R-MF Multi-Family Residential, and R-MH Mobile
Homes Residential) two flags and one flag pole shall be allowed per premises.
Each flag shall be a maximum of 15 square feet in area. The flag pole shall be
a maximum of 25 feet in height or no higher than the highest point of the
principal building's roof, whichever is lower. Flag poles must meet the minimum
yard setback requirements for a principal building.
      (2)   Nonresidential zoning districts. In all other non-residential
zoning districts, one flag per 25 feet of frontage on a right-of-way up to a
maximum of six flags and six flag poles per premises. Each flag shall be a
maximum of 24 square feet in area. Flag poles shall be a maximum of 50 feet in
height but no higher than the highest point of the nearest principal building's
roof on the premises. Flag poles must meet the minimum yard setback
requirements for a principal building or a minimum of ten feet whichever is
more restrictive.
   (F)   Temporary signs shall not be placed or located in such a manner as
they obscure the view of pedestrian or vehicular traffic and shall not be
placed within 25 feet of an intersection.

      (3)   Computing off-street parking and loading requirements.
         (a)   Multiple uses. Lots containing more than one use shall provide
parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all
uses.
         (b)   Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces
result in fractions, any fraction of one-half or less shall be disregarded and
any fraction of more than one-half shall be rounded upward to the next highest
whole number.
         (c)   Area. Unless otherwise noted in these provisions, all square
footage-based parking and loading standards shall be computed on the basis of
gross floor area.
         (d)   Employees, students and occupant-based standards. For the
purpose of computing parking requirements based on the number of employees,
students, residents, or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest
number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the
maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in
the greater number of spaces.
         (e)   Americans With Disabilities Act Requirements (ADA). Pursuant to
federal ADA standards, a portion of the total number of required off-street
parking spaces in each off-street parking area shall be specifically
designated, located and reserved for use by person with physical disabilities.
Responsibility for compliance with ADA, in all respects, shall rest with the
applicant.
      (4)   Location and design of off-street parking and loading spaces.
         (a)   On-site. Except as otherwise specifically provided, required
off-street parking and loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the
principal use.
         (b)   Right-of-way. Off-street parking spaces shall be prohibited
within the public right-of-way; and no portion of the abutting street right-of-
way shall, except for the driveway, be paved or used in any manner except as
green area.
         (c)   Setbacks. In R-E, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-3-L, R-4, R-MF-16 and R-MH
districts, required off-street parking shall not be located within a street
(front or street side) setback. Parking in excess of the required number of
spaces is allowed in the street setback, but not off the driveway, and not in a
manner that obstructs sidewalks or visibility.
         (d)   Where parking is to be provided in the street setback of a
multi-family dwelling, there shall be established a parking setback line of ten
feet. The area between the parking setback line and the front lot line shall be
prepared and planted with grass, shrubs, trees, or ground cover not
inconsistent with other landscaping provisions contained herein, and protected
by interior curbing.
         (e)   In all commercial and industrial districts, required parking is
allowed within the street setback; however, public right-of-way except for the
driveway, shall not be graveled or hard-surfaced.
         (f)   Ingress and egress. Off-street parking and loading spaces shall
be designed to permit exiting vehicles to enter the public right-of-way in a
forward motion. No off-street parking or loading space shall be allowed that
requires vehicles to "back" onto a public right-of-way, except single family
and duplex residential development on local and collector streets.
         (g)   Surfacing. All required off-street parking and loading spaces,
and the driveways serving off-street parking and loading spaces, shall be paved
with asphalt, concrete, or brick, a minimum of 100 feet from the street
frontage right-of-way. Areas designated for display of items for sale, e.g.
vehicles, tractors, implements, ATVs, RVs and the like, will not be required to
adhere to this requirement. Residential driveways, not in a platted subdivision
shall be required to pave with asphalt, concrete, or brick, the portion of
driveway from the edge of the street pavement to the property line or the
right-of-way according to the Master Street Plan, whichever is greater.
         (h)   Drainage. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be
designed with drainage facilities adequate to dispose of all storm water, and
to not increase the storm water runoff onto the surface of adjoining properties
or streets.
         (i)   Curbing. The perimeter of all off-street parking and loading
areas and their access drives shall be curbed, with the exception of single-
family and duplex residences. Landscape islands and other interior features
within parking lots shall also be protected by curbs. In addition, the
principal building on the lot shall be protected by curbs and/or raised
walkways. Rollover curbs shall not be permitted, and wheel-stops are expressly
prohibited as alternatives to meeting curbing requirements. The area between
the curb and the property line, except for the driveway(s), shall be maintained
as green space.
         (j)   Striping. Off-street parking areas containing five or more
spaces shall have parking spaces delineated by pavement striping.
         (k)   Parking space dimensions for residential subdivision. Off-street
parking spaces located outside of a garage/carport structure shall contain a
minimum area of at least 225 square feet per parking space, with a minimum
width of nine feet and a minimum length of 25 feet, measured from the street
right-of-way.
         (l)   Loading space dimensions. Off-street loading spaces shall be a
minimum of 14 feet by 45 feet in size, with a minimum height clearance of 18
feet.
         (m)   Aisle dimensions. Drive aisles within off-street parking lots
shall comply with the following minimum width requirements:
 
Parking angle One-way aisle Two-way aisle
90°          24 feet       24 feet
60°          18 feet       24 feet
45°          16 feet       24 feet
30°          13 feet       24 feet
 
         (n)   Timing of construction. All required parking and loading spaces,
driving aisles, and access ways shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, provided that a temporary certificate of occupancy
may be issued by the city's inspection department if it is determined, based on
information provided by the applicant, that inclement weather or other factors
beyond the control of the applicant have prevented compliance with this
"timing" requirement. Before approval of a temporary certificate of occupancy,
the parking area subgrade and (SB2) stone base shall be compacted in accordance
with the city's construction standards. The temporary certificate of occupancy
shall expire at the end of one120 days or within such shorter timeframe
specified by the inspection department at the time of approval of the
certificate.
         (o)   Use of off-street parking and loading spaces. Required off-
street parking spaces shall be used solely for the parking of motor vehicles in
operating condition, and shall not be used for the storage of vehicles, boats,
motor homes, campers, mobile homes, materials, tractor trailers or other
temporary storage unless they are located in a designated staging area and are
screened, fenced or otherwise fully shielded from public view.
      (5)   Off-site parking. Required off-street parking shall be located on
the same lot as the use it is intended to serve; provided that a portion, not
to exceed 25%, of the required off-street parking spaces may be located on a
remote and separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located, if
the off-site parking complies with the following standards:
         (a)   Ineligible activities. Off-site parking shall not be used to
satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses, restaurants,
convenience stores, or other convenience-oriented uses.
         (b)   Location. No off-site parking area shall be located more than 80
feet from the required parking lot of the use served, unless a shuttle service
is provided. Distance shall be measured along the shortest legal, practical
walking route.
         (c)   Zoning classification. Off-site parking areas shall require the
same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the use
served.
         (d)   Agreement for off-site parking. In the event that an off-site
parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a
written agreement shall be required. An attested copy of the agreement between
the owners of record shall be submitted to the zoning official for recording.
In addition, whether under the same ownership or not, a legal document to
prevent development of the off-site parking area shall be executed and
recorded. Recording of the agreement(s) shall take place before issuance of a
building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area; or in
the case of an existing building, prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
      (6)   Shared parking. The zoning official, subject to appeal to the

no other portion of the lot frontage shall be used for ingress or egress.
Continuous curb cuts are prohibited.
      (2)   Driveway design shall be such that minimization of interference
with through street traffic is achieved, and shall be subject to site plan
approval. The types of vehicles that a driveway is intended to serve shall be a
prime factor in determining the acceptable radii of driveways.
      (3)   Provisions for circulation between adjacent parcels should be
provided through a coordinated or joint parking system.
   (B)   Driveway spacing.
      (1)   Arterial streets. Direct access to any arterial street shall be
limited to the following restrictions:
         (a)   Spacing from signalized intersections. All driveways providing
access to arterial streets shall be constructed so that the point of tangency
of the curb return radius closest to a signalized or stop sign-controlled
intersection, is at least 120 feet from the perpendicular curb face of the
intersecting street. In the event that this standard cannot be met because of
an unusually narrow or shallow lot size, a reduction in spacing may be approved
as long as the reduction does not result in an unsafe traffic condition.
         (b)   Spacing from other (non-signalized) access points. All driveways
providing access to arterial streets shall be constructed so that the point of
tangency of the curb return radius closest to any non-signalized street or
driveway intersection, is at least 80 feet from the perpendicular curb face of
the intersecting street or driveway. In the event that this standard cannot be
met because of an unusually narrow or shallow lot size, a reduction in spacing
may be approved as long as the reduction does not result in an unsafe traffic
condition.
   (C)   Collector streets. Direct access to collector streets shall be
regulated in accordance with the following standards:
      (1)   Spacing from signalized intersections. All driveways providing
access to collector streets shall be constructed so that the point of tangency
of the curb return radius closest to a signalized or stop sign-controlled
intersection, is at least 120 feet from the perpendicular curb face of an
intersecting arterial street and 80 feet from the perpendicular curb face of an
intersecting collector or local street. In the event that this standard cannot
be met because of an unusually narrow or shallow lot size, a reduction in
spacing may be approved as long as the reduction does not result in an unsafe
traffic condition.
      (2)   Spacing from other (non-signalized) access points. All driveways
providing access to collector streets shall be constructed so that the point of
tangency of the curb return radius closest to a non-signalized street or
driveway intersection, is at least 80 feet from the perpendicular curb face of
the intersecting street or driveway. In the event that this standard cannot be
met because of an unusually narrow or shallow lot size, a reduction in spacing
may be approved as long as the reduction does not result in an unsafe traffic
condition.
   (D)   Driveways per parcel.
      (1)   At least one driveway shall be permitted for any lot. Shared
driveways shall be recommended for lots that have less than 120 feet of
frontage.
      (2)   Individual driveways shall be located a minimum of ten feet from
the side property lines. A separation of at least 20 feet is required between
the driveways on one lot and the driveways on the adjacent lots. Driveways on
the same lot shall be no closer than 50 feet to each other.
      (3)   Driveways on corner lots shall be located as far away from the
intersection as possible. In no case shall a driveway be installed closer than
five feet to the beginning of the curb radius.
   (E)   Ingress/egress driveway width. The width of the driveway throat shall
not exceed 40 feet in width. Driveway lanes shall be a minimum of 13 feet in
width and shall not have more than three lanes in one entrance/exit.

requirements of this section.
      (3)   Species mix. When more than ten trees are required to be planted to
meet the standards of this section, a mix of species shall be provided. For
each ten, or fraction thereof, another differing species shall be used.
   (N)   Tree preservation credits. Whenever possible, existing trees,
especially those with an eight-inch or greater DBH (diameter at breast height),
should be preserved. Established trees with existing canopy benefit the city
and enhance the quality of life for citizens.
      (1)   Healthy trees.
         (a)   No tree preservation credits will be allowed for any dead tree,
any tree in poor health, or any tree subjected to grade alterations. Trees
shall be a minimum four-inch caliper to be counted towards tree preservation.
         (b)   Protection during construction. Trees for which credit is given
shall be protected during construction from:
            1.   Mechanical injuries to root, trunk, and branches;
            2.   Injuries by chemical poisoning;
            3.   Injuries by excavation; and
            4.   Injuries by paving.
      (2)   Credit options. If an applicant is preserving trees, he may use the
existing trees as credit either toward a reduction in parking requirements or
in a reduction of the number of trees required, as described below and as
approved by the Planning Board.
         (a)   Reduction of parking requirements. To allow an existing or new
development to preserve trees within or adjacent to a parking lot, the number
or required off-street parking spaces may be reduced as described below:
            1.   Total diameter of all preserved trees from 4 to 7.9 inches
allows the reduction of one required parking space;
            2.   Total diameter of all preserved trees from 8 to 22.9 inches
allows the reduction of two required parking spaces;
            3.   Total diameter of all preserved trees from 23 to 29.9 inches
allows the reduction of three required parking spaces; and
            4.   Total diameter of all preserved trees 30 inches and larger
allows the reduction of four required parking spaces.
         (b)   Reduction of required trees.
            1.   Not to include a reduction to required street trees.
            2.   Not to include a reduction to trees intended as a buffer for a
residential use, or a marginally compatible use, unless the protected trees are
existing within a preserved buffer area.
            3.   Preservation and protection of existing trees on the lot may
be credited toward the tree planting requirements. Credit for preserved trees
shall be permitted at the following rates:
               A.   Total diameter of the preserved tree from 4 to 7.9 inches
allows the reduction of one required large tree;
               B.   Total diameter of the preserved tree from 8 to 22.9 inches
allows the reduction of two required large trees;
               C.   Total diameter of the preserved tree from 23 to 29.9 inches
allows the reduction of three required large trees; and
               D.   Total diameter of the preserved tree 30 inches or greater
allows the reduction of four required large trees.
      (3)   Additional development. If a natural area is left undeveloped in
order to fulfill these credit options, that is then to be developed, all
credits will be revoked; the developer is responsible for adding trees to
replace those for which credit was given.
   (O)   Maintenance and replacement. Trees, shrubs, fences, walls, and other
landscape features (which includes screening) depicted on plans approved by the
city shall be considered as elements of the project in the same manner as
parking, building materials, and other details of the plan are considered
elements. The landowner orsuccessors in interest, or agents, if any, shall be
jointly and severally responsible for the following:
      (1)   Regular maintenance of all landscaping in good condition, and in a
way that presents a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. All landscaping
shall be maintained free from disease, pests, weeds, and litter. This
maintenance shall include weeding, watering, fertilizing, pruning, mowing,
edging, mulching, or other maintenance, as needed and in accordance with
acceptable horticultural practices;
      (2)   The repair or replacement of required landscape structures (for
example, fences and walls) to a structurally sound condition;
      (3)   The regular maintenance, repair, or replacement, where necessary,
of any landscaping required by this section; and
      (4)   Continuous maintenance of the site; three-year guarantee. Guarantee
from the developer that all plant materials will be warranted for a period of
three years from the time of installation. If any material should fail to
survive during that period, it would be replaced during the appropriate
planting season.
   (P)   Alternative methods of compliance.
      (1)   Alternative compliance. Applicants shall be entitled to demonstrate
that the intent of this section can be more effectively met, in whole or in
part, through alternative means. If approved by the Planning Commission, an
alternative compliance landscape plan may be substituted, in whole or in part,
for the landscaping requirements of this section.
      (2)   Procedure.
         (a)   Alternative compliance landscape plans shall be considered
through the site plan review process.
         (b)   Review criteria. In reviewing proposed alternative compliance
landscape plans, favorable consideration shall be given to exceptional
landscape designs that attempt to preserve and incorporate existing vegetation
in excess of minimum standards, and plans that demonstrate innovative design
and use of plant materials. Alternative compliance landscape plans may be
approved upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist on the
proposed building site or surrounding properties:
            1.   Natural land characteristics or existing vegetation on the
proposed development site would achieve the intent of this section;
            2.   Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on
the proposed development site to achieve a buffering effect that is equivalent
to the buffering or screening standards of this section;
            3.   The required landscaping or buffering would be ineffective at
maturity due to topography or the location of improvements on the site;
            4.   The site involves unusually shaped parcels that make full
compliance impossible or impractical;
            5.   Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required
landscaping exceeds the amount that can be approved;
            6.   Safety considerations require a change; or
            7.   The proposed alternative represents a plan that is as good or
better than a plan prepared in strict compliance with the other standards of
this section.
   (Q)   Dedication and landscaping of neighborhood parks.
      (1)   Purpose. Provide health and wellness through recreational
opportunities, social engagement, neighborhood community building, nature
education; parks increase neighborhood and city property values and contribute
to overall quality of life.
      (2)   Ratios for dedication.
         (a)   Developers of residential developments with more than five lots/
units shall dedicate, in perpetuity, to the city, land area exclusive of
streets, for a park and/or trails within the development. Land shall be
dedicated at a ratio of 0.03 acres (1,307 square feet) of land for each single-
family and duplex dwelling unit and 0.01 acres (435 square feet) for each
multi-family dwelling unit (including triplex and quadplex units). If the
dedicated land area will be less than one acre in size, the "in lieu of fee"
will automatically be required.
         (b)   Dedication. Dedication of land must be made before the city
signs the final plat or the building permit is issued for the development.
Deeded land is dedicated park land and is not subject to any right of reversion
or refund.
      (3)   Fee payment in lieu of land conveyance. In lieu of land dedication,
the developer shall contribute to the City Parks and Trails Development Fund
$750 for each single-family or duplex unit and $200 for each triplex, quadplex,
or multi-family unit. The city shall review the designated fees every two years
and make adjustment suggestions to the City Council.
         (a)   Use of fees. Fees in lieu of dedication for parks shall be
deposited in the City Parks and Trails Development Fund and shall only be used
for park or trail acquisition, development, maintenance, or upgrades, as
determined by the city.
         (b)   Fees. Intention for fees in lieu of dedication shall be included
in the development agreement and paid prior to the city's signature of, and
release of, the final plat.
      (4)   Location of park. The most suitable location for a park may be
determined by the developer and approved by the Planning Board. Dedicated park
land shall be contiguous and shall be dedicated in perpetuity. Land, when
dedicated, shall be shown on the preliminary and final plats and on site plans
and landscape plans.
      (5)   Unacceptable park land. Street front landscape buffers or parking
lot landscape buffers and islands; stormwater detention ponds; irrigation
ditches, swales, and stormwater channels; land with excessive grade; land with
immovable trash, junk, and/or pollutants; or any other land deemed unsuitable

      (8)   Ownership and maintenance/replacement. Dedicated parks shall be
maintained by the city.
      (9)   Park design and construction standards. Developer shall design and
construct neighborhood parks in compliance with all city design standards for
public improvements.
      (10)   Performance bond; landscaping installation, maintenance, and
replacement of landscaping materials.
         (a)   Performance bond/guarantee requirement. At the time of
presentation of the final landscape site plan, the developer shall be required
to provide the city with a performance bond, certificate of deposit, or letter
of credit to ensure full compliance with landscape installation and a two-year
replacement/maintenance requirement for the dedicated park. The bond instrument
shall be subject to rules found in §§
152.030 through
152.032 regarding actions to be taken by the city and developer depending on
the type of bond submitted.
            1.   If all landscaping has been installed per the plan, the
performance bond shall be for 50% of the cost of material and labor.
            2.   If the landscaping has not been installed, the bond shall be
for 100% of the cost of material and labor.
            3.   The bond shall be irrevocable and shall list the city as sole
beneficiary.
            4.   The bond shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney.
            5.   The bond shall run for no less than 24 months.
            6.   Should the city have to complete the approved landscaping site
plan and/or replace dead landscaping material within two years of planting, as
determined by the city staff after consultation with the city's engineer, the
city shall be entitled to payment upon making demand for payment under the
terms of the bond, cash deposit, or letter of credit. The city shall be
entitled to use all of the money secured by the bond, cash deposit, or letter
of credit to assure the proper installation or maintenance of the improvement.
            7.   The subdivider shall not be entitled to any excess monies
until the installation and/or maintenance of the improvements in the park have
been satisfactorily completed.
         (b)   Installation. All landscaping shall be installed in accordance
with the standards and requirements of this section. Permits for building,
paving, utilities, or construction shall not be issued until a landscape site
plan including all required information is submitted and approved by the
Planning Board. The landscape site plan must be submitted with the site plan.
         (c)   Delays in planting. When construction has been completed but it
would be impractical to plant trees, shrubs, grass, or other landscape material
due to weather conditions, upon approval of the city, the developer shall be
given additional time to complete all required landscaping; further, a
temporary occupancy permit may be issued by the Building Inspector. The
developer or builder must make every effort to finished the project within the
given timeframe for completion that both parties have agreed to.
         (d)   Enforcement. Final occupancy permits and /or final plats will be
held for those who fail to complete the landscaping requirements that the city
and developer have agreed to.
   (R)   Recommended trees and shrubs.
      (1)   Criteria. The following lists indicate plantings that meet the
landscaping requirements. These are recommendations. Other species may be
considered by the city, unless specifically prohibited in other official city
documents or ordinances. No known invasive species shall be allowed.

§ 153.213 CORNER VISIBILITY.
   On corner lots at intersecting two-way streets, nothing shall be erected,
placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede
vision between a height of two feet and eight feet above curb grade within the
triangular area formed by an imaginary line that follows street side property
lines, and a line connecting them, 25 feet from their point of intersection.
This sight triangle standard may be increased by the city in those instances
deemed necessary for promoting traffic safety, and may be lessened at
intersections involving one-way streets.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.214 RESIDENTIAL COMPATIBILITY STANDARDS.
   The compatibility standards of this section are intended to protect low
density residential uses and neighborhoods from the adverse impacts sometimes
associated with higher density residential uses and nonresidential development.
The standards are intended to mitigate the effects of uses with operating and
structural characteristics that are vastly different than those associated with
single-family uses.
   (A)   Applicability (triggering property). Compatibility standards shall
apply to all development in the N-C and C-1 zoning districts when such
development is adjacent to a "triggering property," which shall include all of
the following:
      (1)   Property occupied by a single-family dwelling unit that is a use
permitted by-right in the zoning district in which it is located; or
      (2)   Property zoned in an A, R-E, R-1, R-2, R-3L, R-3 or R-4 district.
   (B)   Exemptions.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the above applicability provisions, compatibility
standards shall not be triggered by property that is public right-of-way,
roadway, or utility easement.
      (2)   The following uses and activities shall specifically be exempt from
compliance with compatibility standards:
         (a)   Construction of a use permitted by-right in an A, R-E, R-1, R-2,
R-3L, R-3 or R-4 district;
         (b)   Structural alteration of an existing building when such
alteration does not increase the building's square footage or height, or result
in an increase in noise, hours of operation, or other factors which would
impact surrounding properties; and
         (c)   A change in use that does not increase the minimum number of
off-street parking spaces required.
      (3)   Setback standards. The following setback standards shall apply to
all development that is subject to compatibility standards:
         (a)   Within 30 feet of the property line, if a building exceeds the
height of two stories, the portion of the building that exceeds two stories
shall have an additional ten foot setback from the boundary line of an adjacent
"triggering property" for each story above the second story.
         (b)   Small sites. On sites with 20,000 square feet of area or less
that also have less than 200 feet of street frontage, structures shall be set
back from the lot line of triggering property one and one-half times the
required setback.
         (c)   Large sites. On sites with more than 20,000 square feet of area
or 200 feet of street frontage or more, structure shall be set back from the
lot line of triggering property a minimum distance equal to twice the required
setback for the zone in which the structure is to be located.
         (d)   Surface-level parking and driveways. Surface-level off-street
parking areas and driveways shall not be subject to the above setback
standards; however, such standards shall apply to parking structures. Surface-
level parking areas shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the lot line of
triggering property.
      (4)   Screening standards. All requirements found in §
153.212  shall apply. Additionally:
         (a)   Decorative walls, vegetative screening, fencing, or earthen
berms shall be provided to completely screen off-street parking areas,
mechanical equipment, storage areas, and refuse collection areas from view of
triggering property.
         (b)   The required perimeter buffer shall increase from the five feet
required in §
153.212 to ten feet wide when adjacent to a triggering property.
      (5)   Site design standards. The following additional site design
standards shall apply to development that is subject to the compatibility
standards of this section:
         (a)   No swimming pool, tennis court, ball field, or playground area
(except those that are accessory to a single-family dwelling unit) shall be
permitted within 50 feet of the lot line of triggering property.
         (b)   Dumpsters and refuse receptacles shall be located a minimum of
25 feet from the lot line of triggering property.
         (c)   Exterior lighting shall be designed and located to minimize
light spilling onto surrounding property.
   (C)   Applicability (triggering property). Compatibility standards shall
apply to all development in the R-MF-16, C-2, C-T, L-l, and I (EU-L zoning has
compatibility standards in § 153.086) zoning districts when such development is
adjacent to a "triggering property," which shall include all of the following:
      (1)   Property occupied by a single-family dwelling unit that is a use
permitted by-right in the zoning district in which it is located; or
      (2)   Property zoned in an A, R-E, R-1, R-2, R-3L, R-3 or R-4 district.
   (D)   Exemptions.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the above applicability provisions, compatibility
standards shall not be triggered by property that is public right-of-way,
roadway, or utility easement.
      (2)   The following uses and activities shall specifically be exempt from
compliance with compatibility standards:
         (a)   Construction of a use permitted by-right in an A, R-E, R-1, R-2,
R-3L, R-3, or R-4 district;
         (b)   Structural alteration of an existing building when such
alteration does not increase the building's square footage or height, or result
in an increase in noise, hours of operation, or other factors which would
impact surrounding properties; and
         (c)   A change in use that does not increase the minimum number of
off-street parking spaces required.
      (3)   Setback standards. The following setback standards shall apply to
all development that is subject to compatibility standards:
         (a)   Within 50 feet of the property line, if a building exceeds the
height of two stories, the portion of the building that exceeds two stories
shall have an additional 15 foot setback from the boundary line of an adjacent
"triggering property" for each story above the second story.
         (b)   Small sites. On sites with 20,000 square feet of area or less
that also have less than 200 feet of street frontage, structures shall be set
back from the lot line of triggering property one and one-half times the
required setback.
         (c)   Large sites. On sites with more than 20,000 square feet of area
or 200 feet of street frontage or more, structure shall be set back from the
lot line of triggering property a minimum distance equal to twice the required
setback for the zone in which the structure is to be located.
         (d)   Surface-level parking and driveways. Surface-level off-street
parking areas and driveways shall not be subject to the above setback
standards; however, such standards shall apply to parking structures. Surface-
level parking areas shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from the lot line of
triggering property.
      (4)   Building height. No structure shall exceed three stories in height
within 50 feet from the lot line of triggering property.

(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.231 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The Legislature of the State of Arkansas has in A.C. §§ 14-268-101 et seq.
delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council does ordain as
follows in this subchapter.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.232 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified special
flood hazard areas of Tontitown in the current scientific and engineering
report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Washington County,
Arkansas" which is the most recent approved revision of the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM).
   (B)   These special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic flooding
events that result in loss of life and property, pose health and safety
hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (C)   These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the cumulative
effect of floodplain developments which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately flood
proofed or otherwise unprotected structures or uses vulnerable to floods into
special flood hazard areas. Such structures or uses are inherently hazardous to
other lands because of their adverse impact on flooding events.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.233 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development
activities, and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in
identified special flood hazard areas. This subchapter advances the stated
purpose through provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Protect natural floodplains against unwise development;
   (C)   Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development;
   (D)   Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects;
   (E)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (F)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events;
   (G)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
special flood hazard areas;
   (H)   Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base;
and
   (I)   Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a special
flood hazard area.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.234 LANDS TO WHICH THIS SUBCHAPTER APPLIES.
   This subchapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the
jurisdiction of the city.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.235 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   This subchapter uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose:
   (A)   This subchapter restricts or prohibits structures or uses in special
flood hazard areas that adversely impact health, safety or property during
flooding events;
   (B)   This subchapter requires protection against flood damage for
structures or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction, or
after substantial improvement of the structure, or after substantial damage has
occurred;
   (C)   This subchapter controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation and transport of flood waters;
   (D)   This subchapter controls floodplain development (structural
development, placement of manufactured structures, clearing, grading, mining,
drilling, dredging, placement of fill, excavating, watercourse alteration,
drainage improvements, roadway or bridge construction, individual water or
sewer installations and other activities) which may increase flood damage by
increasing flood elevations, flood water velocities, or flood discharge
patterns;
   (E)   This subchapter regulates the construction of flood barriers which
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may adversely impact other lands.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.236 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CODE ADOPTED BY REFERENCE.
   There is hereby adopted by reference a "Flood Damage Prevention Code for the
City of Tontitown, Arkansas," dated August 28, 2007. The code shall be
available for inspection and copying by any person during normal office hours.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.237 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This subchapter does not repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Whenever there is a conflict or overlap
between this subchapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed
restriction, the instrument with the more stringent restrictions applies.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.238 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this subchapter, all provisions
must:
   (A)   Be considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Be liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.239 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this subchapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes. Documented scientific and engineering data
form the basis for these requirements. On rare occasions, flooding events
greater than those considered for this subchapter will occur. In addition,
flood heights may increase over time due to man-made or natural causes. This
subchapter does not imply that land outside special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding, nor that strict adherence to this subchapter protects uses
permitted within special flood hazard areas from all flood damages. This
subchapter specifically does not create liability on the part of the community,
nor any official or employee of the community, for any flood damages that
result while strictly following this subchapter, or from any lawful
administrative decision made under the provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.240 COMPLIANCE.
   Constructing, locating, substantially altering or changing the use of any
structure or land after the effective date of this subchapter requires full
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter and all other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 2017-05-635, passed 5-2-17)
§ 153.241 FEES.

may affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, said decision of the administrative
official.
   (B)   Variance. To hear requests for a variance from the terms of the zoning
regulations in this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship that would deprive the
owner of any reasonable use of the land or building involved. A variance from
the terms of these zoning regulations shall not be granted by the Board of
Zoning Adjustment unless and until:
      (1)   The applicant demonstrates that special conditions and
circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building
involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings
in the same district; that literal interpretation of the provisions of these
regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of these regulations; that
special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the
applicant; and that granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by the zoning regulations to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings
in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands,
structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the
issuance of a variance.
      (3)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall further make a finding that
the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance,
and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of land, building, or structure.
      (4)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall further make a finding that
the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of these zoning regulations, and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
      (5)   In granting any variance, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary or
desirable. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
these regulations.
      (6)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Adjustment grant a
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of these zoning
regulations in the district involved, or any use expressly, or by implication,
prohibited by the terms of these regulations in said district.
   (C)   Special exceptions. In addition to the powers and duties specified
above, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall also have the following powers and
duties to hold public hearings and decide the following special exceptions:
      (1)   Interpret zoning district boundaries, upon appeal of the zoning
official's determination and where uncertainty exists, as to the boundaries of
the zoning districts, or when the street or property lines existing on the
ground are at variance with those shown on the zoning district map.
      (2)   Determine the amount of parking required for a use not listed
herein.
      (3)   Vary the parking regulations by not more than 25% where it is
conclusively shown that the specific use of a building would make unnecessary
the parking spaces otherwise required by these regulations.
      (4)   Permit an addition to a nonconforming structure provided that said
addition conforms to all building code requirements, and further provided that
the current use of the structure conforms to the zoning district in which it is
located.

shall be submitted to the zoning official in a form established for that
purpose, along with a non-refundable re-zone processing fee. The filing
deadline for inclusion on the Planning Commission agenda shall be the first
Tuesday of the month preceding the Planning Commission meeting for the month,
which is held on the fourth Tuesday of the month. No application shall be
processed until the zoning official determines that the application is
complete, and the required fee has been paid.
   (F)   Notice. Promptly upon determining that the application is complete,
the zoning official shall schedule a public hearing date before the Planning
Commission, notify the applicant of the hearing date, and provide at least 15
days notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
The notice shall indicate the time and place of the public hearing; give the
general location and description of the property, such as the street address
and acreage involved; describe the nature, scope and purpose of the
application; and indicate where additional information about the application
can be obtained.
      (1)   The applicant shall: (1) post notice on weatherproof signs provided
by the city; (2) place the signs on the property that is the subject of the
application at least ten days before the public hearing; and (3) ensure that
the signs remain continuously posted until a final decision is made by the City
Council. One sign shall be posted by the applicant for each 300 feet of street
frontage, up to a maximum of four signs. Signs shall be placed along each
abutting street in a manner that makes them clearly visible to neighboring
residents, and passers-by. There shall be a minimum of one sign along each
abutting street.
      (2)   Individual property owners applying for changes to the official
zoning map shall present evidence to the zoning official, at least ten days
prior to the required public hearing, that all property owners within 200 feet
of the boundaries of the subject property have been notified of the proposed
zoning change, and of the time, date, and place of the public hearing. Such
evidence shall consist of postmarked, certified receipts and/or return
receipts.
      (3)   Hearing and recommendation by the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed rezoning. At the
conclusion of the hearing, and after deliberation, the commission shall
recommend approval as submitted; may recommend approval of less area and/or of
a lesser intense, but like classification than what was applied for; table with
cause, not to exceed one time for consideration at the next meeting; or deny
the application. The commission shall, regardless of the action taken, submit
an accurate written summary of the proceedings to the City Council.
      (4)   Hearing and action by the City Council. After the Planning
Commission recommends approval of an application, a City official shall be
responsible for preparing the appropriate ordinance, and requesting that the
Clerk-Treasurer place it on the City Council agenda. The zoning official shall
review the proposed rezoning ordinance, prior to its placement on the City
Council agenda, to verify that the contents of the document, and the property
description therein, accurately reflect the action taken by the Planning
Commission.
       (5)   If the Planning Commission does not recommend approval of an
application, the City Council may consider the matter, but only after an appeal
is filed by the property owner with the City Clerk within ten business days
after the decision has been rendered by the Planning Commission. The appeal
shall consist of a letter from the aggrieved party which sets forth the reasons
for the appeal, any other necessary information as well as the payment of any
required fee.
      (6)   In considering an application for approval, whether on appeal or
not, the City Council may reduce the amount of land area included in the
application, but not increase it; and may change the requested classification
in whole or in part, to a less intense zoning district classification than was
indicated in the Planning Commission’s required public notice.
   (G)   Approval criteria. The criteria for approval of a rezoning are set out
in this section. Not all of the criteria must be given equal consideration by
the Planning Commission or City Council in reaching a decision. The criteria to
be considered shall include but not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Consistency of the proposal with the comprehensive plan.
      (2)   Consistency of the proposal with the purpose of these regulations.
      (3)   Compatibility of the proposal with the zoning, uses and character
of the surrounding area.
      (4)   Suitability of the subject property for the uses to which it has
been restricted without the proposed zoning map amendment.
      (5)   Extent to which approval of the proposed rezoning will
detrimentally affect nearby property including, but not limited to, any impact
on property value, traffic, drainage, visual impairment, odor, noise, light,
vibration, hours of use/operation, and any restriction to the normal and
customary use of the affected property.
      (6)   Length of time the subject property has remained vacant as zoned,
as well as its zoning at the time of purchase by the applicant; and
      (7)   Impact of the proposed development on community facilities and
services, including those related to utilities, streets drainage, parks, open
space, fire, police, and emergency medical services.
   (H)   Successive applications. In the event that the City Council denies an
application for a rezoning, a similar application involving any of the property
considered in the previous rezoning request shall not be considered by the
planning commission for six months from the date of the denial by the City
Council, unless the planning commission, upon recommendation by the zoning
official, determines that there is a significant change in the size or scope of
the project, or that conditions have changed in the area affected by the
proposed rezoning.

§ 153.284 FEES.
   Before any action shall be taken as provided in these regulations, the
applicant shall submit a fee with the application in accordance with the city
codes. Under no condition shall said sum or any part thereof be refunded for
failure of said action to be approved by the city.
§ 153.999 PENALTY FOR VIOLATION.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any of the
provisions of these zoning regulations, or fail to comply thereafter with any
of the requirements thereof, or who shall build, alter, move, or occupy any
building in violation of any detailed statement or plans submitted and approved
hereunder, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be
punished by a fine not exceeding $500 or double such sum for each repetition
thereof. If the violation is, in its nature, continuous in respect to time, the
penalty for allowing the continuance thereof is a fine not to exceed two
hundred fifty dollars $250 for each day that the same is unlawfully continued.
The owner or owners of any building or premises or part thereof where anything
in violation of these regulations shall be placed, or shall exist, and any
architect, builder, contractor, agent, engineer, person, firm or corporation
employed in connection therewith, and who may have assisted in the commission
of any such violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense, and upon
conviction thereof shall be fined as herein above provided.
   (B)   Violations of these regulations that are continuous with respect to
time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable
relief. The imposition of a penalty, however, does not prevent the simultaneous
granting of equitable relief in appropriate cases.

APPENDIX A
FLAG STANDARDS
Excerpts from The Flag Code
Title 4, United States Code, Chapter 1
§ 6. Time and occasions for display
(a)   It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to
sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a
patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if
properly illuminated during the hours of darkness.
§ 7. Position and manner of display
(c)   No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level,
to the right of the flag of the United States of America, except during church
services conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be
flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the Navy.
(e)   The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at
the highest point of the group when a number of flags of States or localities
or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.
(f)   When flags of States, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are
flown on the same halyard with the flag of the United States, the latter should
always be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag
of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or
pennant may be placed above the flag of the United States or to the United
States flag’s right.
§ 8. Respect for flag
   (i)   The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner
whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or
handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or
boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising
signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is
flown.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001 PURPOSE AND SCOPE; CONFLICTS; PERMITTED USE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide policies and
procedures for the placement of small wireless facilities, which will provide a
public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage,
and visual qualities of the city and comply with applicable state and federal
laws, regulations and guidelines.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the city is establishing uniform
standards to address issues presented by small wireless facilities, including
without limitation:
      (1)   Health, safety, and welfare of citizens;
      (2)   Limit interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways, public utilities,
public views, certain city corridors, and other public ways and places;
      (3)   Limit the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (4)   Limit interference with the facilities and operations of facilities
lawfully located in rights-of-way or public property;
      (5)   Limit environmental damage, including damage to trees;
      (6)   Respect the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed by minimization of visual clutter and preservation of the character
and aesthetics of areas in close proximity to small wireless communication
facilities;
      (7)   Facilitate the city's permitting process to encourage fair and
meaningful competition;
      (8)   Encourage collocation of antenna on existing facilities; and
      (9)   Facilitate deployment of small cell facilities to provide the
benefits of advanced wireless services to all citizens and organizations
throughout the city. Municipalities recognize the economic and social value of
data connectivity and desire to encourage wireless infrastructure investment by
providing a fair and predictable process for the deployment of small wireless
facilities within the public rights-of-way in a manner that is:
         (a)   Safe;
         (b)   Compatible with and complementary to the provision of services
by the municipality and others lawfully using the rights-of-way; and
         (c)   Consistent with the aesthetic standards of the municipality.
   (C)   Zoning and use of rights-of-way by wireless provider.
      (1)   A wireless provider shall have the right, as a permitted use not
subject to zoning review or approval, to collocate, maintain, modify, operate,
and replace small wireless facilities and to install, maintain, modify, and
replace poles it owns or manages or, with the permission of the owner, a third
party's pole, associated with a small wireless facility, along, across, upon,
and under the right-of-way.
      (2)   Small wireless facilities and associated poles shall be installed
and maintained as to not obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety
of the right-of-way or the usage of the right-of-way by utilities.
      (3)   Therefore, applications to collocate a small wireless facility or
install or modify an associated utility pole in the rights-of-way shall be
treated as a permitted use in all districts within the city, but are not exempt
from the following local regulations and review.
      (4)   All wireless facilities not meeting the definition of a small
wireless facility shall be subject to applicable local zoning and development
requirements.
   (D)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (E)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the wireless services provider shall comply with the requirements of
this chapter to the extent that its provisions are not preempted by, or do not
conflict with, applicable federal or state laws or regulations.

interfere with pedestrian, cyclist, or vehicular movements), or below grade.
      (2)   Where underground utilities are required by the provisions of this
code or other city adopted regulations or codes, ancillary equipment related to
the small wireless facility shall be placed in an underground vault to the
greatest extent possible.
   (F)   Design. Consistent with the provisions of this section, a small
wireless facility shall be installed using the following design approaches to
the extent reasonable including without limitation the following:
      (1)   For location on newly proposed wireless support structures, the
following options are available:
         (a)   New poles installed to support small wireless facilities shall
be made of the same or similar material as existing poles in the immediate
area.
         (b)   In an area where other above ground utilities are present, the
deployment of a new small cell facility shall be located on the same side of
the street which the existing above ground utilities are located and a similar
style utility pole (as those utilized by existing above ground utilities) may
be utilized.
         (c)   In an area where the city has required all electrical and
communication lines to be placed underground by a date certain that is three
months before the submission of the application or where undergrounding is
required after small wireless facilities have been installed, an explanation as
to why collocation or use of an existing structure, remaining pole or
replacement pole is not technically feasible shall be required. This shall
apply to the location of all pole attached utilities and shall include
demonstration of a reasonable attempt to collocate or utilize an existing
structure. A wireless provider may install a new pole in the designated area
that otherwise complies with this section when it is not able to provide
wireless service by collocating on an existing structure, remaining pole or
replacement pole
         (d)   When a wireless provider applies to install a new pole in the
right-of-way in an area zoned for residential use, the city may propose an
alternative location in the right-of-way within 100 feet of the location stated
in the application, and the wireless provider shall use the city's proposed
alternative location unless the location imposes technical limits or
significant additional costs.
            (i)   The wireless provider shall certify that it has made the
determination in good faith, based on the assessment of a licensed engineer,
and the wireless provider shall provide a written summary of the basis for the
determination.
         (e)   The city may require wireless providers to comply with
reasonable and nondiscriminatory horizontal spacing requirements of general
application for new poles and ground-mounted small wireless facilities, but the
requirements shall not prevent a wireless provider from serving any location.
      (2)   For location on existing pole structures:
         (a)   Stealth antennas and mounts (completely encased or screened
antennas, when possible, to approximately match the color of the existing
poles). In the event that some antennas cannot be covered due to their
operational wavelength, the applicant shall provide proof of such to the city
and the antenna shall be required to be painted in a way that blends with the
pole.
         (b)   Stealth base cabinet enclosures (completely encases base cabinet
equipment to match the colors of the existing poles to the extent feasible). A
base cabinet may be placed in any location on the lower portion of the pole,
but may not impede ADA accessibility of a sidewalk. The base cabinet may also
be placed underground.
         (c)   The city shall not limit the collocation of small wireless
facilities by minimum horizontal separation distance requirements from existing
small wireless facilities, poles, or wireless support structures.
      (3)   For location on existing building structures:
         (a)   New steeple, extension to existing steeple, and replacement
steeple concealment structures;
         (b)   Chimney concealment structures;
         (c)   Chimney pot concealment structures;
         (d)   Rooftop facade extension concealment;
         (e)   Rooftop cupola concealment;
         (f)   Rooftop screen concealment;
         (g)   Rooftop pod concealment systems;
         (h)   Building side grid concealment structures;
         (i)   Building side screen concealment structures; and
         (j)   Rooftop or wall mounted lantern concealment structures.
   (G)   Antenna arrays, cables, and other ancillary facilities used for
providing the wireless service shall not be obtrusive or noticeably visible
from adjacent properties or adjacent rights-of-way.
   (H)   The color of the facility shall be compatible with that of the non-
tower support structure. To the extent any small wireless facilities extend
above the height of the vegetation buildings and utilities immediately
surrounding it, they shall be painted in a non-reflective light gray, light
blue, or other hue, which blends with the skyline and horizon.
   (I)   Attachments which are ancillary to the antenna arrays mounted onto a
non-tower support structure shall not project greater than three feet, as
measured horizontally, from the surface of the non-tower support structure and
shall be painted or screened with materials that are a compatible color to the
non-tower support structure. Cables that travel along the exterior of a non-
tower support structure shall be closely connected to the structure creating a
minimal appearance of gaps or loose wires. When possible, visible cables should
be in conduit or otherwise covered in a material visually compatible in color
to the support structure.
   (J)   The general design of a small wireless facility shall be compatible to
the streetscape and aesthetics of the surrounding area with respect to street
furniture and lights, building facade designs, and area character.
   (K)   Other design elements which by industry standards are considered
stealth technology deployment may also be used.
   (L)   Within enacted overlay district, stealth concealment is required
except when specifically identified by the applicant that such stealth
concealment results in a material reduction in the functionality of the
proposed small wireless facility.
   (M)   Signage. The provisions of §§
153.180 through
153.185 of the Tontitown Municipal Code regarding signage shall apply to all
small wireless facilities.
   (N)   Illumination. A small wireless facility shall not have lights on the
facility unless the lights are required by other laws and consistent with the
requirements of law or designed as an intended amenity of the support
structure.
   (O)   Fencing. A small wireless facility installed in the public right-of-
way shall not be fenced.
   (P)   Appendix. Attached to this chapter as an appendix to this section are
illustrations to provide guidance to applicants of aesthetic standards
encouraged and preferred by the city in the installation of small wireless
facilities and associated poles.
(Ord. 2019-08-856, passed 8-20-19)
§ 156.024 USE OF RIGHT-OF-WAY AND INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   The wireless provider shall fully indemnify and hold harmless the city
and its officers, agents and employees against any claims, demands, damages,
lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, and attorney's fees
resulting from the installation, construction, repair, replacement, operation,
or maintenance of poles, small wireless facilities, or attachments to city
poles to the extent directly caused by the negligence of the wireless provider,
its contractors, subcontractors and their officers, employees or agents.
   (B)   A permit from the city shall not create a property right or grant any
authority to the owner of the small wireless facility to impinge upon the
rights of others who may already have an interest in the right-of-way.
(Ord. 2019-08-856, passed 8-20-19)
