§ 10.18 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage

Example:   (Ord. 1960-1, passed 1-1-60; Am. Ord. 1970-1, passed 1-1-70; Am.
Ord. 1980-1, passed 1-1-80; Am. Ord. 1980-2, passed 6-1-80)
   (B)   (1)   If a statutory cite is included in the history, this indicates
that the text of the section reads substantially the same as the statute.
Example:   (A.C. § 14-14-906) (Ord. 1980-1, passed 1-1-80; Am. Ord. 1985-1,
passed 1-1-85).
      (2)   If a statutory cite is set forth as a “statutory reference”

§ 10.19 ORDINANCES MAY NOT APPEAR VERBATIM.
   In order to create a code of ordinances that is consistent in style and
capitalization, which utilizes proper grammar, spelling and punctuation, and
which streamlines redundant language commonly found in ordinances, stylistic
changes and improvements to this code have been made that will enhance
readability and consistency, but which do not affect the meaning of the law.
Consequently, ordinances may not read verbatim to the code section.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Whenever in this code or in any ordinance of the county any act is
prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful, an offense or a violation, or

thereof in violation of this code or the ordinance shall not exceed $250 for

to create the Drug Court Program Fund on the books of Jackson County in
accordance with A.C. § 16-98-304(7)(C) as amended by Act 490 of 2009. A.C. §

user fee to be used locally to support the local circuit drug court program.
The “program user fees” shall be set by the Drug Court Judge and shall be
credited to a fund known as the “Drug Court Program Fund.” This Court
understands and affirms that said “program user fees” shall be appropriated,
within the limitations set forth in A.C. § 14-20-103, by the Quorum Court for
the benefit and administration of the Drug Court Program. Other aforementioned
fees and costs shall be collected and disbursed by the appropriate officials in
accordance with current state law or as set forth by order of the Drug Court
Judge.

Judge shall be collected by the Circuit Court Clerk and maintained in
accordance with county accounting law, specifically A.C. §§ 14-25-103 and 14-
25-116. Said fees shall be remitted monthly to the Jackson County Treasurer as
required by A.C. §§ 14-14-1313 and 21-6-310. The County Treasurer shall credit
said funds to the Drug Court Program Fund for the benefit of the Drug Court
Program. Disbursements from this fund by the County Treasurer shall only be
made when a proper appropriation has been made by the Quorum Court.

§ 35.24 DEFINITION.
    The term SINGLE TRANSACTION , for the purpose of rebate under this
subchapter, shall be defined according to the nature of the goods purchased, as
follows.
   (A)   When two or more devices in which, upon which or by which any person
or property is or may be transported or drawn, including but not limited to on-
road vehicles, whether required to be licensed or not, off-road vehicles, farm
vehicles, airplanes, water vessels, motor vehicles or non-motorized vehicles
and mobile homes are sold to a person by a seller, each individual unit,
whether part of a "fleet" sale or not, shall be treated as a single transaction
for the purpose of this subchapter, and rebate of the county-wide sales and use
tax be made for the excess over $25 paid on each individual unit, provided this
provision shall not apply to motor vehicles handled under Section 10(b) of Act
26 of 1981, First Extraordinary Session.
   (B)   The charges for utility services which are subject to the taxes levied
under this subchapter and which are furnished on a continuous service basis,
whether such services are paid daily, weekly, monthly or annually, for the
purpose of the rebate provisions of this subchapter shall be computed in
monthly increments, and each such monthly charge increment shall be considered
to be a single transaction for the purposes of this subchapter.
   (C)   For sales of building materials and supplies to contractors, builders
or other persons, a single transaction for the purposes of this subchapter
shall be deemed to be any single sale which is reflected on a single invoice,
receipt or statement on which aggregate sales (or use) tax figure has been
reported and remitted to the state.
   (D)   When two or more items of major household appliances, commercial
appliances, major equipment and machinery are sold, each individual unit shall

has been reported and remitted to the state.
   (F)   That for purposes of the county sales tax as provided for in this
subchapter as amended and as applied to the construction of any single-family
residential structure, a single transaction shall be considered to be the
completed structure. The sales tax imposed by said subchapter as amended shall
be levied based upon the final cost of the materials purchased to build said
structure rather than upon the incremental sales of materials used in said
construction. Not more than one rebate per residence shall be paid and rebate
requests must be submitted within 60 days of completion of the structure.

for the services of the State of Arkansas in collecting and distributing the
collections of the Sales and Use Tax, the collections of the Sales and Use Tax
shall be distributed to the county and shall be used to provide a portion of
the funds to operate and maintain or to make capital improvements to the
college. The county shall either make the expenditures directly or contract
with the college for the same.
   (C)   Currently, the college is a two-year college located in the county and
is owned and operated by Arkansas State University. However, the term "college"
as used herein shall mean a two-year college in the county, whether or not

unattended vehicle, abandoned vehicle, or impounded or seized vehicle shall
adopt a written vehicle removal policy, the provisions of which shall not be in
conflict with this subchapter.
            2.   a.   Any vehicle removal policy shall provide that owner
preference as defined by this subchapter shall be offered to the owner, to his
or her agent, or to any competent occupant of any disabled or inoperative
vehicle except in those instances of exigent circumstances or where the
immediate clearing of a public thoroughfare mandates an expedited towing
service.
               b.   In those instances where exigent circumstances or where the
immediate clearing of a public thoroughfare mandates an expedited towing
service, owner preference shall be honored when the owner has requested a
towing service that is located in the particular towing zone where services are
to be rendered and is ready to promptly respond to the request for service.
               c.   (i)   If a law enforcement officer fails to provide an
owner of a vehicle with an owner preference as required under this section,
then the owner may file a complaint with the law enforcement agency that
employs the law enforcement officer or the state Towing and Recovery Board, or
both.
                  (ii)   Nothing in this subsection precludes a person who has
been denied the right of owner preference from seeking any other legal or
equitable remedy.
            3.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the
towing of a vehicle in violation of other provisions of this subchapter.
         (b)   All law enforcement officers shall comply with the policies
prescribed by their agencies as to the removal of an unattended vehicle,
abandoned vehicle, or impounded or seized vehicle as defined by this
subchapter.
         (c)   No law enforcement officer shall:
            1.   Suggest or recommend any particular towing and storage firm to
the owner, his or her agent, or any competent occupant of any disabled or
inoperative vehicle; or
            2.   Accept gifts or special consideration from the owner of a
towing business or anyone acting on the owner's behalf in relation to removal
of vehicles as provided by this subchapter.
         (d)   Upon request, any law enforcement officer or his or her agency
who orders a removal pursuant to this subchapter shall provide to the owner, to
his or her agent, or to any competent occupant of the removed vehicle the name,
location, and telephone number of the towing and storage firm requested to
remove and store the vehicle.
         (e)   1.   Should the owner or lienholder of a vehicle removed under
this subchapter consider that the removal of the vehicle was not legally
justified or properly subject to a law enforcement hold, the owner or
lienholder may within 30 days after removal or within 30 days after the receipt
of notification of a law enforcement hold from the towing and storage firm,
whichever is later, seek a review to determine whether the unattended vehicle,
abandoned vehicle, disabled vehicle, or inoperative vehicle was wrongfully
removed or withheld from the owner through the following procedures.
            2.   Administrative review and appeal: In the case of a vehicle
removed by or at the request of a County Sheriff's office employee, the
administrative review shall be made by filing a petition with the Chief Deputy
of the County Sheriff's office, with subsequent appeals to the County Sheriff.
Appeal of the final decision of the Sheriff shall be filed by petition to the
County Court, to be heard by the County Judge, under jurisdiction over cases
“necessary to the internal improvement and local concerns of the county” as
provided under Article 7, § 28 of the Arkansas Constitution, with the right to
appeal the final decision of the County Court to Circuit Court in the time and
manner provided by law.
            3.   The petition shall name the state agency ordering the tow as a
respondent and, when filed in Circuit Court, shall also name the towing company
among the respondents if the towing company still possesses the vehicle. In the
case of removal originated by an agency of a political subdivision of the
state, the petition shall name the county, city, or town as a respondent.
            4.   If the vehicle, its contents, or both are subject to
impoundment or seizure by law enforcement under the state Rules of Criminal
Procedure or a court order, the procedure for return or restoration of the
impounded or seized vehicle and its contents shall be governed exclusively by
Rule 15 of the state Rules of Criminal Procedure to the extent applicable.
         (f)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to waive the
sovereign immunity of the state nor any immunities granted to its political
subdivisions, the county, and their officers and employees.
         (g)   This policy shall not be construed to defeat a lien held by a
towing company under A.C. § 27-50-1208.

90.01   Beaver Eradication Program
§ 90.01 BEAVER ERADICATION PROGRAM.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish the Jackson
County Beaver Eradication Program to control the beaver population in the
county. The control of the beaver population is necessary to prevent flooding
of dammed up creeks, ditches and other waterways, which, in turn, causes
thousands of dollars in damage annually to the county's road, bridges and
drainage system. The Beaver Eradication Program is necessary to qualify for
reimbursements from the state.
   (B)   Background.
      (1)   The county has always had problems with beavers building dams in
creeks and spillways causing flooding. This problem in the past has generally
confined to the bottom lands of the county where the area is sparsely populated
and used mainly for agriculture purposes. However, in recent years, the beaver
population has spread to other parts of the county.
      (2)   The damage caused by beavers includes stopping up tiles, building
dams against the piling of bridges along with building dams in the creek
channels and major drainage ditches. This work by the beavers causes severe
flooding in the areas surrounding the dammed up areas. In addition, the backed
up waters often flood roadways and side ditches which soften the roadbed. The
pressure and weight created by flood waters backed up against the bridge
pilings causes the bridge structure to be weakened. This damage deteriorated
the quality and safety of the county's road systems and increases dramatically
the county's road budget in maintaining these damaged areas. In addition, the
dammed up waters contribute to the mosquito and other disease problems.
      (3)   The county is not the only sector affected by this problem. The
private sector has seen many of the same problems that affect the county. The
beavers have caused spillways on farmlands to be plugged, thereby causing
flooding in farm fields and the destruction of the farm crop. Spillways on farm
ponds have been dammed up also, causing the ponds to overflow the levees which,
in turn, causes the pond levees to weaken and sometimes break.
   (C)   State reimbursement.
      (1)   Act 630 was enacted by the Arkansas 79th General Assembly, Regular
Session, 1993 and became effective on July 1, 1993. The Act is entitled “An Act
to Make an Appropriation for Reimbursements to Counties Which Have an
Established Beaver Eradication Program for the Department of Finance and
Administration - Disbursing Officer for the Biennial Period Ending June 30,
1995; and For Other Purposes."
      (2)   Act 630 provides that up to $150,000 may be appropriated by the
Department of Finance and Administration for each fiscal year of the biennial
period ending June 30, 1995.
      (3)   The Act provides that “each county which establishes a County
Beaver Eradication Program shall be eligible to receive state reimbursements
from monies appropriated in Section 1 of this Act, up to five dollars ($5.00)
per beaver carcass.”
   (D)   Program.
      (1)   It is hereby established by the Quorum Court, the Beaver
Eradication Program, and administered by the Jackson County Conservation
District beginning July 1, 1994.
      (2)   The County Judge is authorized by the Quorum Court to establish the
procedures by which beaver carcasses or parts thereof necessary to receive
state reimbursements are delivered to the county. Such procedures will also
include a set time or times and place or places that hunters and trappers can
turn the beavers into the county. The Judge will also institute accounting
procedures to keep track of the beavers turned in, the issuance of receipts and
the method by which individuals will be reimbursed for the beavers that are
turned in.
      (3)   The County Treasurer is hereby authorized to pay to the Soil
Conservation District all sums paid to the county by the state pursuant to Act
630 and this section. The Treasurers authorization is continuing and shall not
require further orders of this count.
      (4)   The amount that the county will pay individuals for the beavers
under the Eradication Program will be set by the Quorum Court by resolution at
any regular meeting. The Quorum Court may change the reimbursement as necessary
depending on the response to the program and the funds available from the
county and the amount that will be available from the state and other sources
as reimbursement.
      (5)   The Quorum Court may limit the amount paid per beaver to the amount
that the state and other sources will reimburse the county. Such reimbursement
is expected to be $5 per beaver. However, if the amount is less than $5 or even
zero reimbursement, the Quorum Court can choose that amount. The Quorum Court
may elect to pay an additional amount for the beaver pelts beyond the state
reimbursement amount, with such funds being paid out of county funds, or funds
from other sources.
   (E)   Program contingency.
      (1)   The active operation of the Beaver Eradication Program will be
contingent upon the appropriation of funding by the state and the availability
of reimbursements to the county. Therefore, if state money is not appropriated
for this project, the county will not have to pay for any beavers, unless the
Quorum Court elects otherwise.
      (2)   If funds are appropriated for this project by the state, the Beaver
Eradication Program will commence operating. Once any appropriated state
reimbursement funds are exhausted, the Quorum Court may suspend its Beaver
Eradication Program until such time that additional state funding is available.
      (3)   In the event that the state program is not funded, the Beaver
Eradication Program will remain in place and inactive until such times monies
are available from the state. When funds are available for the county, this
will be placed into active operation until the funds are exhausted.

§ 150.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The Legislature of the State of Arkansas has in A.C. § 14-268-101 et seq.,
delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations
to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Quorum Court of Jackson County,
Arkansas, does hereby ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified Special
Flood Hazard Areas of Jackson County in the current scientific and engineering
report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Jackson County," dated
September 25, 2020, with an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated
September 25, 2020.
   (B)   These Special Flood Hazard Areas are subject to periodic flooding
events that result in loss of life and property, pose health and safety
hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (C)   These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the cumulative
effect of floodplain developments which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately
floodproofed or otherwise unprotected structures or uses vulnerable to floods
into Special Flood Hazard Areas. Such structures or uses are inherently
hazardous to other lands because of their adverse impact on flooding events.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development
activities, and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in
identified Special Flood Hazard Areas. This chapter advances the stated purpose
through provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Protect natural floodplains against unwise development;
   (C)   Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development;
   (D)   Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects;
   (E)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (F)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events;
   (G)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
Special Flood Hazard Areas;
   (H)   Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base;
and
   (I)   Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a Special
Flood Hazard Area when not in compliance with the floodplain ordinance.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.04 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the
jurisdiction of Jackson County.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   This chapter uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose:
   (A)   This chapter prohibits structures or uses in a floodway or regulatory
floodway and in Special Flood Hazard Areas that adversely impact health, safety
or property during flooding events;
   (B)   This chapter requires protection against flood damage for structures
or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction, or after
substantial improvement of the structure, or after substantial damage has
occurred;
   (C)   This chapter controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation and transport of flood waters;
   (D)   This chapter controls floodplain development (structural development,
placement of manufactured structures, clearing, grading, mining, drilling,
dredging, placement of fill, excavating, watercourse alteration, drainage
improvements, roadway or bridge construction, individual water or sewer
installations and other activities) which may increase flood damage by
increasing flood elevations, flood water velocities, or flood discharge
patterns;
   (E)   This chapter allows the use of FEMA's Estimated Base Flood Elevation
and FEMA's NFHL. Viewer software for BFE Determinations where available in
Jackson County;
   (F)   This chapter regulates the construction of flood barriers which
unnaturally divert Floodwaters or which may adversely impact other lands.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.06 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CODE ADOPTED BY REFERENCE.
   (A)   There is hereby adopted by reference a "Flood Damage Prevention Code
for Jackson County, Arkansas," dated February 11, 2021. The code shall include:
      (1)   ARTICLE 1 DEFINITIONS;
      (2)   ARTICLE 2 ADMINISTRATION;
      (3)   ARTICLE 3 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (B)   A copy of the referenced code shall be filed in the office of the
Jackson County Clerk and shall be available for inspection and copying by any
person during normal office hours.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter does not repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Whenever there is a conflict or overlap
between this chapter and another chapter, easement, covenant, or deed
restriction, the instrument with the more stringent restrictions applies.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions must:
   (A)   Be considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Be liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes. Documented scientific and engineering data
form the basis for these requirements. On rare occasions, flooding events
greater than those considered for this chapter will occur. In addition, flood
heights may increase over time due to man-made or natural causes. This chapter
does not imply that land outside Special Flood Hazard Areas will be free from
nor that strict adherence to this chapter protects uses permitted within
Special Flood Hazard Areas from all flood damages. This chapter specifically
does not create liability on the part of the community, or any official or
employee of the community, for any flood damages that result strictly following
this chapter, or from any lawful administrative decision made under the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.10 COMPLIANCE,
   Constructing, locating, substantially altering or changing the use of any
structure or land after the effective date of this chapter requires full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 2017-4, passed 5-11-17; Am. Ord. 2021-2, passed 2-11-21)
§ 150.99 PENALTY FOR NON-COMPLIANCE.
   Flood hazards are reduced by compliance with the provisions of this code.
Accordingly, enforcement of this chapter discourages non-compliance and is a
recognized mechanism for flood hazard reduction.
   (A)   The Floodplain Administrator must enforce the provisions of this
chapter and is authorized to:
      (1)   Issue cease and desist orders on non-compliance floodplain
development projects;
      (2)   Issue a must appear affidavit warrant for non-compliance;
      (3)   Issue a deed notice;
      (4)   Request that FEMA file a 1316 Action (denial of flood insurance)
against non-compliance properties;
      (5)   Take any other lawful action necessary to prevent or remedy any
instance of non-compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   It is a misdemeanor to violate or fail to comply with any provision of
this chapter.
   (C)   Any person found in a court of competent jurisdiction, guilty of
violating this chapter is subject to fines of not more than $500 per day for
each violation; in addition the defendant is subject to payment of all
associated court costs involved in the case.
