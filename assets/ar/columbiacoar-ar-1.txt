§ 10.18 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and the most recent three amending ordinances,
if any, are listed following the text of the code section.
Example:   (Ord. 1960-1, passed 1-1-1960; Am. Ord. 1970-1, passed 1-1-1970; Am.
Ord. 1980-1, passed 1-1-1980; Am. Ord. 1980-2, passed 6-1-1980)
   (B)   (1)   If a statutory cite is included in the history, this indicates
that the text of the section reads substantially the same as the statute.
Example:   (A.C.A. § 14-14-906) (Ord. 1980-1, passed 1-1-1980; Am. Ord. 1985-1,
passed 1-1-1985).
      (2)   If a statutory cite is set forth as a statutory reference following
the text of the section, this indicates that the reader should refer to that
statute for further information.
Example:
   § 39.01 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.
      This county shall make available to any person for inspection or copying
all public records, unless otherwise exempted by state law.
   Statutory reference:
      For provisions concerning the inspection of public
       records, see A.C.A. §§ 25-19-101 et seq.
§ 10.19 ORDINANCES MAY NOT APPEAR VERBATIM.
   In order to create a code of ordinances that is consistent in style and
capitalization, which utilizes proper grammar, spelling and punctuation, and
which streamlines redundant language commonly found in ordinances, stylistic
changes and improvements to this code have been made that will enhance
readability and consistency, but which do not affect the meaning of the law.
Consequently, ordinances may not read verbatim to the code section.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   When an act is prohibited or rendered unlawful by this code or by
county ordinance and no specific fine or penalty is otherwise provided, the
fine or penalty imposed shall not exceed $500 for any one specified offense or
violation or double that sum for each repetition of the offense or violation.
   (B)   If an act prohibited or rendered unlawful is, in its nature,
continuous in respect to time, the fine or penalty for allowing the continuance
thereof in violation of this code or the ordinance shall not exceed $250 for
each day that it may be unlawfully continued.
   (C)   All fines and penalties imposed for violation of any county ordinance
shall be paid into the County General Fund.

§ 34.10 BILLING CONVICTED PRISONERS FOR THE COST OF CONFINEMENT IN THE COUNTY
DETENTION FACILITY.
   (A)   Affirmation. The Columbia County Quorum Court finds that the cost of
housing prisoners in the County Detention Facility continues to increase. It
also finds that A.C.A. § 12-41-505 et seq. allows counties to enact ordinances
to create a mechanism to recoup housing costs from prisoners. Therefore, it is
the belief and finding of the Quorum Court that each person who is committed to
the County Detention Facility by lawful authority for any criminal offense or
misdemeanor, if convicted, shall pay the expenses in carrying him or her to
jail, and also for his or her support from the day of his or her initial
incarceration for the whole time he or she remains a prisoner in the County
Detention Facility.
   (B)   Levy. The Quorum Court hereby finds that the average jail housing cost
per day shall be $40 for room and board of each prisoner in the County
Detention Facility. A DAY is defined to be immediately upon booking and then
each 24-hour period thereafter.
   (C)   Billing process. When a county prisoner is delivered to court, the
Sheriff or the Sheriff's designee shall provide to the Prosecuting Attorney an
invoice for the expenses in carrying the prisoner to jail, and also for the
prisoner's support from the day of his or her initial incarceration and for the
whole time he or she remains there. These expenses shall be imposed as an
additional element of cost to be assessed as part of the judgment upon
conviction. The assessed amount shall be converted to a judgment as per A.C.A.
§ 12-41-505.
   (D)   Collection. Once the collectible expenses have been converted to a
judgment, they shall be collected in the same manner as fines and court costs.
The property of the detainee shall be subject to the payment of such expenses
in accordance with A.C.A. § 12-41-505.
   (E)   Disposition. The cost levied by this section, converted to a judgment
by the proper court and collected by the proper authorities, shall be deposited
monthly with the County Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall credit the funds
to the Jail Fund to help defray the cost in incarcerating prisoners.
   (F)   Legislative intent. It is the intent of the Quorum Court that the
revenues derived from the additional judgment levied by this section shall not
offset or reduce funding from other sources for the maintenance, operation and
capital expenditures of the County Detention Facility.
(Ord. 2012.7, passed 2-6-2012; Am. Ord. 2022.24, passed 12-5-2022)
§ 34.11 COLLECTING A FEE FROM PRETRIAL PRISONERS FOR THE COST OF MONITORING
PARTICIPANTS IN THE COUNTY HOME INCARCERATION PROGRAM.
   (A)   Affirmation. The Columbia County Quorum Court finds a significant
number of pretrial detainees are placed on house arrest as part of the County
Home Incarceration Program. This program, pursuant to the orders of the trial
court, mandates monitoring services required to ensure compliance with the
terms and conditions in the program.
   (B)   Authority to collect. Under A.C.A. § 21-6-307, a sheriff may collect a
fee of $30.00 per month for enforcing each order, notice or rule of the court.
   (C)   Levy. The Quorum Court hereby assesses a fee of $30.00 per month to
each participant in the County Home Incarceration Program to enforce the rules
of the trial court. If a participant stays in compliance with the program for
six months, the fee shall be waived for the remainder of the participant's time
in the program. If a participant does not remain in compliance and is arrested,
should the participant be allowed to participate in the program again, the
participant shall pay for the full term of their participation in the Home
Incarceration Program.
   (D)   Collection. The participant in the Home Incarceration Program shall
pay for monitoring by the tenth of the month, beginning from the date of
participation. If participation begins prior to the tenth of the month, the
first payment will be due in the current month. If participation begins after
the tenth of the month, the first payment will be due in the following month.
Any participant who fails to pay no later than the 20th for monitoring shall be
found in noncompliance. As such, the participant shall be subject to arrest and
immediately returned to the County Detention Facility.
   (E)   Disposition. The fee levied by this section collected by the County
Sheriff’s Department shall be deposited monthly with the County Treasurer. The
County Treasurer shall credit the funds to the County General Fund to help
defray the cost of monitoring participants in the Home Incarceration Program.
   (F)   Legislative intent. It is the intent of the Quorum Court that the
revenues derived from the judgment levied by this section shall not offset or
reduce funding from other sources for the maintenance, operation and capital
expenditures of the County Sheriff's Department.

   Pursuant to A.C.A. § 16-10-209, all installment payments made by criminal
defendants to the Columbia County District Court, which are attributable to
charges initiated by the County of Columbia, Arkansas, shall be allocated as
follows:
   (A)   All installment payments are initially deemed collections of
restitution;
   (B)   After restitution is fully collected, all installment payments shall
be allocated 50% to court costs and 50% to fines; and
   (C)   Whenever either court costs or fines are fully paid, all remaining
installment payments shall be allocated to remaining amounts due.

system to transfer directly into the payee’s accounts in their financial
institution, payment of any claim against the county, the Quorum Court hereby

trail.

that two or more items of solid waste bear the name or names of one or more
persons who are nonresidents of the county, and that the names are in such a
form as to indicate that the person or persons are or were the owners of those
items and those items are unlawfully disposed of as defined herein, then the
person or persons are presumed to have committed the unlawful act of disposal
by a nonresident in county trash receptacles.

recommendations based on the results of the sound study. The property owner
must provide a copy of the report of the study to the County Judge and file
with the County Clerk within 30 days of completion of the report.
      (3)   Noise attenuation plan requirements. 
         (a)   The property owner must consult with a third-party architectural
or design firm to develop a building plan that includes necessary noise
attenuation measures in order to prevent the external sound level emanating
from the data center from exceeding the sound level limitations below which
will be considered a noise disturbance. The building plan is not required to
adopt any or all of the noise attenuation recommendations so long as the plan
includes noise attenuation measures that the architectural or design firm deems
adequate to be in compliance with this chapter. Noise attenuation measures may
include but are not limited to:
            1.   Soundproofing walls, screens, panels, fences, or enclosures;
            2.   Buffer yards;
            3.   Other noise attenuation measures recommended by the third-
party acoustic engineer.
         (b)   Mechanical equipment must be shown on any proposed plan and must
be fully screened on all sides. Mechanical equipment not screened by a facade
of the building must be screened by a visually solid fence, screen wall or
panel, or parapet wall and constructed with a design, materials, details, and
treatment compatible with those used on the nearest facade of the building.

comply with the noise attenuation requirements of this chapter and must be
designed and submitted to the County Judge and filed with the County Clerk
within 30 days of completion of the report.
      (4)   Post completion noise study requirements.
         (a)   Upon the data center's completion, the data center operator must
conduct a post-construction noise study performed by a third-party acoustic
engineer to document noise levels emanating from the data center when
mechanical equipment is running at full capacity, including all HVAC units and
generators necessary for peak operation. Noise levels are to be measured at the
property line in the original eight locations used during the baseline study.
The data center operator must provide a copy of the report to the County Judge
and file with the County Clerk within 30 days of completion of the study.
         (b)   The data center shall not begin operations until the completion
of the post-construction noise study and submission to the County Judge and
County Clerk as required above. In order for the data center to be in
compliance, the noise study results must show that its operation is in
compliance with this chapter. If the results show that the data center is not
in compliance with this chapter, the data center will be unable to commence
operation until the required noise attenuation measures and noise limitations
are met.
         (c)   Furthermore, the data center operator must conduct annual noise
studies under the baseline and post-construction studies specifications in
accordance with divisions (a) and (b) above. The data center operator must
provide the results to the County Judge and file with the County Clerk within

§ 150.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Arkansas has in A.C.A. §§ 14-268-101 et seq.
delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations
to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the County Quorum Court does ordain as
follows.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified Special
Flood Hazard Areas of the county in the current scientific and engineering
report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Columbia County, Arkansas
and Incorporated Areas," dated October 17, 2006, with an effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated October 17, 2006.
   (B)   These Special Flood Hazard Areas are subject to periodic flooding
events that result in loss of life and property, pose health and safety
hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (C)   These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the cumulative
effect of floodplain developments, which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-
proofed or otherwise unprotected structures or uses vulnerable to floods into
Special Flood Hazard Areas. Such structures or uses are inherently hazardous to
other lands because of their adverse impact on flooding events.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development
activities, and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in
identified Special Flood Hazard Areas. This chapter advances the stated purpose
through conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Protect natural floodplains against unwise development;
   (C)   Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development;
   (D)   Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects;
   (E)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (F)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events;
   (G)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
Special Flood Hazard Areas;
   (H)   Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base;
and
   (I)   Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a Special
Flood Hazard Area.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.04 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the
jurisdiction of the county.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   This chapter uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose:
   (A)   This chapter restricts or prohibits structures or uses in Special
Flood Hazard Areas that adversely impact health, safety or property during
flooding events;
   (B)   This chapter requires protection against flood damage for structures
or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction, or after
substantial improvement of the structure, or after substantial damage has
occurred;
   (C)   This chapter controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation and transport of flood waters;
   (D)   This chapter controls floodplain development, including structural
development, placement of manufactured structures, clearing, grading, mining,
drilling, dredging, placement of fill, excavating, watercourse alteration,
drainage improvements, roadway or bridge construction, individual water or
sewer installations and other activities which may increase flood damage by
increasing flood elevations, flood water velocities, or flood discharge
patterns;
   (E)   This chapter regulates the construction of flood barriers which
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may adversely impact other lands.
(Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.06 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CODE ADOPTED BY REFERENCE.
   (A)   There is hereby adopted by reference a Flood Damage Prevention Code
for Columbia County, Arkansas, dated August 14, 2006. The Code shall include:
      Article 1   Definitions
      Article 2   Administration
      Article 3   Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
   (B)   A copy of the referenced Code shall be filed in the office of the
County Clerk and shall be available for inspection and copying by any person
during normal office hours.
(Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter does not repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Whenever there is a conflict or overlap
between this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed
restriction, the instrument with the more stringent restrictions applies.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions must:
   (A)   Be considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Be liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes. Documented scientific and engineering data
form the basis for these requirements. On rare occassions, flooding events
greater than those considered for this chapter will occur. In addition, flood
heights may increase over time due to man-made or natural causes. This chapter
does not imply that land outside Special Flood Hazard Areas will be free from
flooding, nor that strict adherence to this chapter protects uses permitted
within Special Flood Hazard Areas from all flood damages. This chapter
specifically does not create liability on the part of the community, nor any
official or employee of the community, for any flood damages that result while
strictly following this chapter, or from any lawful administrative decision
made under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006)
§ 150.10 COMPLIANCE.
   Constructing, locating, substantially altering or changing the use of any
structure or land after the effective date of this chapter requires full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 90-2, passed 7-2-1990; Am. Ord. 2006.20, passed 8-14-2006) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Flood hazards are reduced by compliance with the provisions of this
chapter. Accordingly, enforcement of this chapter discourages noncompliance and
is a recognized mechanism for flood hazard reduction.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator must enforce the provisions of this
chapter and is authorized to:
      (1)   Issue cease and desist orders on noncompliant floodplain
development projects;
      (2)   Issue citations for noncompliance;
      (3)   Request that FEMA file a 1316 Action (Denial of Flood Insurance)
against noncompliant properties; and
      (4)   Take any other lawful action necessary to prevent or remedy any
instance of noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   It is a misdemeanor to violate or fail to comply with any provision of
this chapter.
   (D)   Any person found, in a court of competent jurisdiction, guilty of
violating this chapter is subject to fines of not more than $500 per day for
each violation. In addition, the defendant is subject to payment of all
associated court costs and costs involved in the case.
