§ 74.09 TRAFFIC CALMING DEVICES.
   (A)   General
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines for the
application of traffic calming devices, which are to regulate speeds along a
residential street. Research has shown that traffic calming devices are an
effective and appropriate tool for safely reducing vehicle speeds on certain
types of streets when installed in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In order to accommodate all who travel the roadway, this provisional
section will outline the procedures and criteria for the installation of safe
and effective traffic calming devices.
      (2)   In order for traffic calming devices to be effective, they should
be located selectively in accordance with the defined purpose of reducing
documented speeding problems. As in the case with all traffic-related devices,
proper installation will also minimize driver frustration and encourage safe
driving practices. This process also allows residents affected by proposed
traffic calming devices to participate and provide input in the installation
process. The framework also provides for a sharing of the traffic calming
device installation cost between the city and the petitioning parties under
certain conditions.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning,
      APPLICATION FOR TRAFFIC CALMING DEVICES. The petition and requisite
documents requested by the city.
      OFFICIAL ACCIDENT REPORT. A police filed report of an accident due to
speeding.
      RESIDENT. When used in cost sharing, does not necessarily refer to the
petitioners. It is the share of the cost that is not the responsibility of the
city and could be paid by one or more of the residents or from other private
sources. Residents may be able to expedite traffic calming device installation
by voluntarily paying the full installation cost.
      RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS. Single-family houses, town homes, duplexes, and
mobile homes.
      ROAD HUMPS. Artificial hump(s) in or on the surface of the roadway which
is designed to control the speed of vehicles. References to a ROAD HUMP include
references to any other works (including signs or lighting) required in
connection with such a hump.
      SPEED CRITERIA. The speed five mph, or more, over the legal speed limit.
      SPEED CUSHION. A speed hump with an unraised path for fire trucks and
ambulances through the hump. Speed cushions are devices designed as several
small speed humps installed across the width of the road with spaces between
them. They are generally installed in a series across a roadway resembling a
split speed hump.
      SPEED HUMP. A geometric design feature of a roadway, consisting of a
raised area in the roadway pavement surface extending transversely across the
travel way, whose primary purpose is to reduce the speed of vehicles traveling
along that roadway.
      SPEEDS. Eighty-fifth percentile speeds, i.e., the speed at or below which
85% of vehicles are traveling.
      STREET. The street that must be petitioned. It is a 1,100 foot segment
generally centered on the location of the speed cushions or the length of the
block, whichever is greater. If the 1,100 foot segment extends into any part of
an adjacent block, it includes the entire length of the adjacent block, unless
separated by an intervening thoroughfare or offset intersection. No traffic
signals or stop signs should be located within the 1,100 foot segment to be
considered for traffic calming device installation. Installation of a traffic
calming device will not be considered within 300 feet of a traffic signal.
      TRAFFIC CALMING DEVICES. Includes, but not limited to the size, type, and
composition of any traffic calming device speed bump(s), road hump(s), hump(s),
cushion(s), table(s). This section shall be applied retroactively, and all
previously installed traffic calming devices, as defined above, including, but
not limited to, speed bump(s), hump(s), cushion(s), table(s) must also be
approved.
   (C)   Eligibility requirements. All of the following criteria must be
satisfied for a street to be considered eligible for traffic calming device
installation. The city reserves the right to change any or all of the criteria
if deemed necessary.
      (1)   Petition. A petition from the residents that documents that at
least 75% of all households or a majority vote of a property owner’s/
homeowner’s association, abutting to the project street, support their
installation of one or more traffic calming device.
      (2)   Location of the street. The land uses of the properties abutting
the street where the traffic calming device is proposed must primarily be
residential dwellings.
      (3)   Operational characteristics of the street.
         (a)   Traffic calming devices should only be installed on those
roadways functionally classified as “local” streets. These streets generally
permit direct access to abutting lands, connect to higher classification
streets, offer the lowest level of traffic mobility and deliberately discourage
service to through traffic movement. These “local” streets should be
residential in nature.
         (b)   There must be no more than one moving lane of traffic in each
direction.
         (c)   The street must have a posted or prima facie speed limit of 30
mph or less as determined in accordance with state law.
         (d)   Traffic calming devices shall not be installed without the prior
approval from the Volunteer Fire and Police Departments, respectively.
      (4)   Geometric characteristics of the street.
         (a)   The street must have adequate sight distances to safely
accommodate the traffic calming device as determined by the Maintenance
Department.
         (b)   The street must not have curves or grades that prevent safe
placement of the traffic calming device and where the visibility of the traffic
calming device is restricted.
         (c)   The street must be paved.
   (D)   Cost responsibility. The cost for the traffic calming device
installation includes materials for said humps, signs, pavement markings, and
if necessary, special design features such as bollards, curbing, or guardrails.
The costs can be shared between the city and residents. The city may spend up
to $2,500 in related expenses. All expenses above this threshold shall be on a
cost-share basis with the petitioning party, for all expenses above $2,500.
Streets that request city funding are ranked according to City Council’s
determination on an annual basis. If the city’s available funds for this
program are not sufficient to install a traffic calming device on the street
during the fiscal year it is brought to City Council, it will remain eligible
for the following fiscal year.
   (E)   Project prioritization. Traffic calming devices are prioritized on a
city-wide first-come, first-need basis. This ensures proper allocation of the
city’s resources. The projects will be ranked according to the criteria
developed by City Council and administration. The project prioritization is
subject to revision.
   (F)   Procedures for traffic calming device installation.
      (1)   The initial request for the installation of traffic calming devices
must originate from the residents living on the street or from a City Council
member through City Council action. A request in writing from a resident or
representative must be forwarded to the following address:
         Ordinance 2023-05: Traffic Calming Devices
         City Council
         701 N. Tool Dr.
         Tool, TX 75143
      (2)   A preliminary determination of eligibility based on available
traffic data will be made in a timely manner.
         (a)   If the street is determined not to be eligible, the applicant(s)
will be given written notification of that determination and its reasons. The
street cannot be taken into consideration for traffic calming devices until two
years after the first study was done.
         (b)   The decision may be appealed in writing to the City
Administrator within 15 days of the notification date. The City Administrator
will review the determination and respond to the applicant(s) within 30 days of
the appeal request.
         (c)   If the street is determined to be eligible for consideration, a
meeting will be arranged between the applicant(s) and staff to define the
petition area and the approximate traffic calming device location. The
applicant(s) or Council member making the request will be instructed to submit
a petition indicating that a minimum 75% of the low-density dwelling households
on the street support the installation of traffic calming devices as provided
in the outlined section. Only petition forms supplied by the city may be used
for this purpose.
      (3)   After verification of the petitions, city staff will conduct the
necessary research, studies and solicit comments and recommendations of other
parties/organizations. A determination of the street’s eligibility for traffic
calming device installation will be made in a timely manner, (within two city
meetings after submittal), based on the policies set forth.
         (a)   If the street is determined not to be eligible for traffic
calming device installation, the applicant(s) or Council member making the
request will be notified in writing giving the reason.
         (b)   The decision may be appealed in the same manner as in division
(F)(2).
         (c)   If the street is determined to be eligible, the street will be
placed on a list of streets eligible for traffic calming device installation.
      (4)   City Council will make a determination of the total installation
cost and the cost sharing responsibility of the residents, if applicable,
according to the traffic calming device policy.
      (5)   Depending on the method used to pay for the cost of the traffic
calming device installation, either division (F)(5)(a) or division (F)(5)(b)
will apply. Division (F)(5)(a) will apply if there is no city participation in
the cost (i.e., the cost will be fully paid with voluntary private funding).
Division (F)(5)(b) will apply if the residents request city participation in
paying for the cost of the traffic calming device installation, if that option
is available under division (D).
         (a)   Once a street is placed on the list of streets approved for
traffic calming device installation, the city will submit an invoice to the
representative of the residents or the president of the POA/HOA for the cost of
the traffic calming device installation. Upon receipt of payment of the cost,
the traffic calming devices will be installed as scheduling permits. If full
payment has not been received within one year from the statement date, the
street shall be removed from the list of streets approved for traffic calming
device installation and all monies received by the city, if any, will be
returned to the payer; or
         (b)   The Maintenance Department will prepare a report on an annual
basis containing a list of streets approved for traffic calming device
installation that require city funding, either in whole or part, in a request
for funding to the City Council. The report will rank the requests in an order
of priority determined by the following calculation:
            1.   When a budget amount for traffic calming device installations
has been approved by the City Council, the Maintenance Department will
determine which installations, based on the calculations and research, will be
funded from the budgeted amount. Representatives of the applicants for all
approved traffic calming device installations will be notified of which
requests have been funded for the coming fiscal year.
            2.   Installations not included in the group to be funded can be
approved if their full installation cost (including the city’s share) is
voluntarily paid, as provided in division (F)(5)(a).
            3.   The city will submit a statement to the representative of the
residents for any cost based on the provisions of the traffic calming device
policy. It will list the total cost, portion to be paid by residents, and the
portion to be paid by the city. Upon funding approval and receipt of payment in
full of the residents share, the traffic calming device will be installed as
scheduling permits. If full payment of the residents share, if any is required,
has not been received within one year from the statement date, the street will
be removed from the list of streets approved for traffic calming devices and
all monies received, if any, returned to the payer.
   (G)   Traffic calming device removal and alteration. The process for traffic
calming device removal or alteration by residents is the same as the process
for installation, except that there is no city participation in cost sharing.
In case the city determines that unforeseen problems exist due to the traffic
calming device, it may be redesigned or removed by the city. In such case, the
city will bear the cost of the traffic calming device removal.
   (H)   Traffic calming device location. A traffic calming device must not be
located in front of a property if the occupant objects to its placement or, in
the case of a property containing low-density multiple dwellings, if a majority
of the households on the property object to its placement. Fulfillment of this
requirement is the responsibility of the applicant(s). Traffic calming devices
will not be installed within 30 feet of a signalized intersection. Traffic
calming devices should not be installed in front of a driveway. The exact
traffic calming device locations will be determined by the City Council in
conjunction with the Maintenance Department, subject to traffic safety and
operation requirements.
   (I)   Design standards and procedures. The Maintenance Department shall
prepare and maintain current design standards and installation procedures for
traffic calming devices in accordance with this section. The city will be
responsible for the maintenance of traffic calming devices and all related
features. The city reserves the right to change or modify any of these
standards or procedures as may deem necessary.
   (J)   Traffic calming device processing.
      (1)   Where it is determined that a specific traffic safety hazard
exists, City Council may request the installation of a traffic calming device
(s) through this special provision through City Council action only after a
study/research has been conducted and determined that a traffic calming device
(s) was not warranted by the minimum guidelines of this policy. City Council
will exercise the option to use this special provision provided that the
following minimum guidelines are met:
         (a)   Minimum eighty-fifth-percentile speed of 30 mph.
         (b)   Minimum street length of 700 feet.
         (c)   Recommendation from the Fire Chief of the Volunteer Fire
Department and the Police Chief of the city.
         (d)   Approval by 75% of residents abutting the proposed traffic
calming device(s) project location.
         (e)   Minimum of one official accident report within a one year period
prior to date of official traffic calming device request.
         (f)   Geometric characteristics of the affected section of street does
not create a safety hazard for the motoring public if a traffic calming device
is installed or creates a drainage issue as advised by an engineer.
      (2)   City Council will make the final decision to install the traffic
calming device under this special provision and could require the use of their
respective discretionary funds for the cost involved in the installation of the
traffic calming devices.
   (K)   Penalty. Any person who violates a provision of this section or who
does not comply with the requirements of this section shall upon conviction by
the municipal court of the city be subject to a fine not to exceed $500 for
each offense, each traffic calming device, including, but not limited to, speed
bump(s), hump(s), cushion(s), table(s), not in compliance shall constitute a
separate offense.

      (2)   A copy of the mailbox assembly permit application form is attached
to Ordinance 2022-02 as Exhibit B. This form may be revised or updated from
time-to-time as needed without having to amend these requirements.
   (D)   Relocation and replacement.
      (1)   The city reserves the right to remove, relocate or cause to be
relocated and/or replace any existing mailbox assembly located within public
right-of-way that interferes with the safety of the traveling public or the

that interferes with pedestrian traffic, including the removal and replacement
of custom-built mailbox assemblies with standard mailbox assemblies.
      (2)   Any type of mailbox assembly located in city right-of-way is
subject to damage or destruction at any time. The city shall not assume any
liability for damaged or destroyed mailbox assemblies of any type installed

the city. The city will provide the property owner with a written notice of
violation, after which time, based on an assessment of hazard to the public,
the property owner will be granted not less than 24 hours nor more than 30
calendar days to remove the mailbox assembly. Upon expiration of the specified
removal period, the mailbox assembly will be removed by the city at the
property owner's expense.

that does not meet these requirements interferes with the safety of the
traveling public or the function, maintenance, or operation of the city's
roadway or utility systems or interferes with pedestrian traffic as detailed
within this section, the mailbox assembly will be permitted to remain.

   (A)   Generally. In the event a permit is approved for issuance by the city
under the terms of this chapter for the drilling and operation of a well, no
actual drilling operation shall be commenced until the permittee shall file
with the City Secretary and maintain in current status sufficient security in
the form of a bond or certificate of deposit approved for form by the city
attorney, or cash in lieu of the full amount of the bond, in such principal sum
of not less than $50,000. No less than 10% of such bond herein shall be a cash
bond. The remaining amount may be in the form of a surety bond executed by a
reliable insurance company authorized to do business in the state as surety,
and with the permittee as principle, running to the city for the benefit of the
city and all persons concerned. Any certificate of deposit filed as permitted
herein in lieu of the surety portion of the bond shall be free of any prior
claim or obligation and shall not be pledged as security for any other purposes
save and except as specified herein. Any such bond or other security pledged as
required herein shall be effective on or before the date it is filed with the
City Secretary and remain in force and effect for a period of at least six
months subsequent to the expiration of the term of the permit issued herein.
   (B)   Supplemental security. If the proceeds of the security required herein
shall be applied to remedy noncompliance as provided in§
113.090 of this chapter, the permittee shall be required to immediately provide
additional security of a like kind to maintain at all times the level of
security as required under this chapter. Failure to maintain security at all
times as required under this chapter shall constitute cause for revocation of
permit as provided in §
113.037.
   (C)   Additional security. If at any time the City Council shall reasonably
deem any permittee’s bond or other security to be insufficient, the City
Council may require the permittee to file a new bond or additional security.
   (D)   Conditions of security. Any security filed as required under the
provisions of this section shall be conditioned, on penalty of forfeiture or
partial forfeiture to the city without written notice, on the following:
      (1)   The permittee shall comply with all of the terms and conditions of
this chapter;
      (2)   The permittee shall promptly pay all fines, penalties or other
assessments imposed upon permittee by reason of permittee’s breach of any of
the terms, provisions and conditions of this chapter;
      (3)   The permittee shall remedy any and all damage to streets, curbs,
gutters, water lines, fire hydrants and other property of the city, occasioned
in any manner by permittee in connection with the drilling, operation or
abandonment of said well;
      (4)   The permittee shall promptly fulfill all obligations under this
chapter, and shall conduct the drilling operations in full conformance with the
requirements herein, including, but not limited to, abatement of dust and dirt,
removal of mud from public streets and thoroughfares, watering of non-paved
access roads, timely construction and erection of all fence structures as
required herein, and other similar terms and provisions;
      (5)   The permittee shall promptly clear all premises of all litter,
trash, waste and other substances used, allowed or occurring in the drilling or
producing operations, and shall, after abandonment, grade, level and restore
said property in conformance with the city’s drainage control ordinance; and
      (6)   The permittee shall in all things fulfill the requirements of the
site plan, and if required, any reclamation or restoration of the site stated
as a condition of the issuance of the permit.
   (E)   Reduction in principal amount. If after completion of a well, the
permittee has complied with all the provisions of this chapter and the permit
requirements set forth in §
113.035, the permittee may apply to the city to have the bond or other security
reduced to a sum of not less than $10,000 for the remainder of the time the
well produces. If the oil and gas official approves the reduction, the
permittee shall submit a bond or certificate of deposit in the correct
principal amount, or cash in lieu thereof, and otherwise in conformance with
the provisions of this section as a substitute for any other security
previously pledged under the provisions of §
113.032(A). The requirement that $5,000 of the security requirement be in the
form of a cash bond applies to the reduced security amount.
   (F)   Blanket bond. A permittee holding more than one permit may provide
security for more than one operating well in the form of a blanket bond or
certificate of deposit in the approved form specified herein, or cash in lieu
thereof, in the principal amount of not less than $10,000 per well covered by
said security. The blanket security will secure all wells operated by the
permittee within the city limits of the city provided said blanket security
conforms to the requirements of this section.
   (G)   Return of security. For each completed well covered by security under
this section that ceases to produce and is subsequently plugged and abandoned
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission, the security for said
well shall be returned to the principal or in the case of blanket security,
said well shall no longer require such security. To qualify for release of
security as set out herein, the permittee must provide copies of official
Commission forms verifying the plugging and abandonment of the well and must
remove all surface equipment used in the operation of the well including, but
not limited to, pumps, compressors, storage tanks and separator tanks.

§ 116.01 AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to prevent establishments from becoming
places of illegal gambling. Illegal gambling often attracts the criminal
element. Average citizens often conduct business in these establishments, which
makes them easy victims of robberies, assaults, and thefts. Often times illegal
gambling attracts the sale, distribution, and use of illegal narcotics which is
detrimental not only to the youth of the incorporated city limits but also to
the general quality of life for the citizens.

   (A)   The owner of presently developed property or developer of property to
be developed shall be responsible for all storm drainage flowing through or
abutting their property, including the instillation of culverts beneath all
driveway approaches to the property. This responsibility includes drainage
directed to that property by prior development as well as drainage naturally
flowing through the property by reason of topography. Further, the property
owner or developer of property to be developed shall maintain five feet at each
end of all culverts. Maintenance of culverts (if on city right-of-way) shall be
maintained by the property owner.
   (B)   Culverts, ditches and other drainage facilities required of property
owners and developers, to meet the responsibilities outlined in division (A)
above, shall be sized and constructed or installed in accordance with city
standards and specifications. Permits for culverts shall be required in
accordance with this section. Culvert pipe in residential areas shall not be
less than 12 inches in diameter and culvert pipe shall not extend more than 50
feet in length without a five-foot length break for the purpose of cleaning out
same. It shall be the responsibility of the Building Inspector, and a
designated representative from the Road Commission to determine the appropriate
culvert pipe diameter applicable in each instance. Any size culvert pipe, or
culvert installation that has the potential to impede the flow of water, shall
be replaced by an adequate size culvert pipe and installed so as to permit the
free flow of water.
   (C)   No building permit shall be issued, nor certificate of occupancy
approved, upon any land on which the owner has not fulfilled his or her
responsibility for drainage as outlined in divisions (A) and (B) above.

manner impair the usefulness of any drainage channel, ditch, creek or water
course or fill in the area of any said natural creek, drainage channel or ditch
with dirt or other debris shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (E)   Provisions shall be made by the owner for the control and drainage of
surface water around buildings. Runoff water from rains and storms shall not be
allowed to inundate or flood adjacent property when such flooding is the result
of grading, drainage ditches, retaining walls or other surface alterations that
control or divert the natural flow of water. Rain water shall not be conveyed,
received or discharged upon property belonging to another or adjacent to such
property. Where potential flooding on adjacent property exists from run off
water from an unguttered roof, each roof shall be installed with property
guttering containing down spouts arranged in such a manner that the runoff
water will not be discharged on the adjacent property.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, METHODS AND DEFINITIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Tex.
Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units
to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City
Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-15-2009)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-15-2009)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-15-2009)
§ 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the lime of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 2009-05, passed 10-15-2009)
§ 152.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING. Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan
or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport and deposition;
and unpredictable flow paths.

path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
   APPURTENANT STRUCTURE. A structure which is on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to
the use of the principal structure.
   AREA OF FUTURE CONDITIONS FLOOD HAZARD. The land area that would be

velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or
sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may
be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed

A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE,
AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for Zones
A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30 or VE that indicates the water surface elevation
resulting from the flood that has a 1% chance of equaling or exceeding that
level in any given year. Also called the BASE FLOOD.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   BREAKAWAY WALL. A wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under
specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion
of the building or supporting foundation system.
   CRITICAL FEATURE. An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ELEVATED BUILDING. For insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which
has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls,
shear walls, posts, piers, pilings or columns.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING
CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the

hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water  surface elevations, or an
examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mud flow) and/or
flood-related erosion hazards.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood
hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). See FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see definition of flooding).
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,

ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such
state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards
for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM. Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area
within a community subject to a “special flood hazard” and the extent of the

or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either: any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
or any alteration of a “historic structure”,  provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements, see § 60.6 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3),

public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in divisions (A) through (I) of this section

(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.086 STREETS.
   (A)   Conformity to major street plan. The arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the City of Tool
Thoroughfare Plan and the Design Standards for the City of Tool and shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned street or driveways, to
topographical conditions, to public safety and in their appropriate relation to
the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. Reserve strips of
land controlling access to or egress from other property, or to or from any
street or alley, of having the effect of restricting or damaging the adjoining
property for subdivision purposes or which will not be taxable or accessible
for special improvements shall not be permitted in any subdivision.
   (B)   Streets not on Thoroughfare Plan. When such a street is not on the
Thoroughfare Plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
streets in surrounding areas;
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
city to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions
make continuance or conformity to existing streets impracticable;
      (3)   Provide for future access to adjacent vacant areas that will likely
develop under a similar zoning classification; and
      (4)   Not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway
openings.
   (C)   Through traffic discouraged on minor streets. Minor residential
streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged, but access is provided to adjacent subdivisions.
   (D)   Through traffic. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed arterial street, the City Council may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such treatment as may
be necessary for adequate protection to residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
   (E)   Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except where their control is definitely placed by the city under
conditions approved by the City Council. When provisional one foot reserves are
used along the side or end of streets that abut acreage tracts, the following
note shall be used in all such dedications: "One-foot reserve to become
automatically dedicated for street purposes when adjacent property is
subdivided in a recorded plat, and access to dedicated tract is hereby
prohibited until such action occurs."
   (F)   Street offsets. Intersecting streets with centerline offsets of less
than 125 feet shall be prohibited.
   (G)   Large-lot subdivisions. If the lots or tracts of land in the proposed
subdivision are large enough to accommodate resubdivision in the future or if
part of the tract is not subdivided, consideration must be given to possible
future street openings and access to future lots that could result from such
resubdivision.
   (H)   Street intersections. Arterial intersections shall be between 85
degree and 95 degree angles and each leg shall be tangent for a distance of at
least 50 feet from the intersection. Other street intersections shall be laid
out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street
shall intersect at less than 70 degrees.
   (I)   Street widths. Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown on the
Thoroughfare Plan and where not shown therein shall be not less than those
shown in the design standards.
   (J)   Half streets. Construction of half streets shall be prohibited, except
when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming
with the other requirements of these  regulations and the Thoroughfare Plan,
and where the Planning and Zoning Commission finds it will be practical to
require the dedication of the other one-half when the adjoining property is
subdivided. If the subdivider is responsible for one-half of the street, the
subdivider shall escrow the amount of the construction cost of the facility
unless the city participates in the construction of the facility. Whenever a
partial street previously has been platted along a common property line, the
other portion of the street shall be dedicated. Improvements shall be made to
all on-site facilities as defined herein.
   (K)   Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac street shall not be longer than 600 feet and
at the closed end shall have a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter
of at least 80 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet.
The cul-de-sac shall be measured from the centerline of the intersecting street
to the centerline of the cul-de-sac turn-around.
   (L)   Dead end streets. Dead end streets are not allowed except to provide
for access to adjacent land areas and in no case shall be more than 250 feet in
length or equal to one lot depth, whichever is greater. A dead end street may
be up to 600 feet long if a temporary cul-de-sac is provided according to the
above standard. The following note should be placed on the plat: "Cross-hatched
area is temporary easement for turn-around until street is extended (give
direction) by future improvements." Proper provision shall be made for drainage
at the ends of dead end streets. In the event an existing dead end street is
extended, the subdivider extending such street must, at his or her cost, remove
the turn-around facilities, construct the extension to the standards contained
herein and restore the affected area compatible with adjacent property.
   (M)   Street names. New streets that are an extension of existing streets
shall bear the names of the existing streets and shall be dedicated at equal or
greater widths than the existing streets. No new street names shall be used
that will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street
names shall be subject to the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (N)   Street signs. The total cost of street signs shall be furnished to
[MISSING TEXT].
   (O)   Street lights. Street light locations and installations shall be
[MISSING TEXT].
   (P)   Street construction conditions. All new streets dedicated within a
subdivision shall be constructed in accordance with paving widths and
specifications as set forth in the Design Standards for the City of Tool at the
time at which the final plat is approved and adhere to the following
conditions:
      (1)   The subdivider shall employ a civil engineer, experienced in street
design and duly licensed to practice in the State of Texas, for the preparation
of the streel plans and profiles. These plans shall be subject to the review
and acceptance by the city. Construction shall explicitly follow these approved
plats, unless specific written concurrence is obtained from the City Engineer
for deviations from said plans.
      (2)   The subdivider shall employ a registered professional land surveyor
or civil engineer to provide construction staking for the street facilities.
      (3)   All streets shall be constructed by an eligible contractor employed

      (6)   Standard curb and gutter shall be constructed on both sides of the
street and adjacent to medians, where applicable, including all curb returns,
in accordance with the Design Standards for the City of Tool, and to the line
and grade shown on the construction plans accepted by the city.
      (7)   The city shall provide inspection services during the construction;
however, such inspection shall be only for the purpose of ensuring that the
city-approved plans and specifications are complied with and that the completed
work is obtained therein described. The subdivider and his or her engineer
shall retain responsibility for the design and for ensuring that construction
is completed in accordance with the city-accepted plans and specifications.
   (Q)   Pavement widths.
      (1)   Pavement widths shall be 30 feet from face-of-curb to face-of-curb

by the City's Thoroughfare Plan;
         (b)   The street serves more than 30 dwelling units;
         (c)   Adjacent to or serving commercial, multifamily, or industrial
land use or in a residential subdivision where, in the opinion of the City
Planner, additional street width is indicated for property access and
circulation; and
         (d)   Where, in the opinion of the city or in the opinion of the
subdivider with the concurrence of the city, the aesthetic value achieved from
extra width is dictated by special conditions (such as the entrance to a
subdivision).
      (2)   In the case of division (Q)(1)(a) above, the section to be
constructed shall be in accordance with the Thoroughfare Plan or a revision
thereof based on updated conditions. In the case of (Q)(1)(b) above, a
collector street shall be the minimum street section used. In the case of (Q)
(1)(c) and (Q)(1)(d) above, each condition shall be studied individually and
approved by the city prior to approval of the subdivision in question.
   (R)   Access and entrances. Subdivisions generally shall provide one point
of access in each direction (north, east, south, and west) to adjacent property
or to a roadway. All residential development shall provide no less than one
entrance for each 50 lots including stubs for future development and in no case
shall have more than 150 lots for each connection to an existing road.
   (S)   Designated streets not to be private. Dedicated streets and rights-of-
way shall not be designated or used as private streets and such use is
prohibited.
   (T)   Traffic studies may be required. Where traffic conditions require,
traffic engineering studies may be required by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or the City Council from the subdivider to provide technical data.

   (A)   Approved water and sewer system required. Subdivisions within the city
and its extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be provided with an approved water
supply and distribution system and with an approved sewage collection and
disposal system. An adequate water supply and distribution system and sanitary
sewer system, consistent with the Master Plan for Water and Sanitary Sewer,
shall be a condition of plat approval.
   (B)   Subdivider to provide water and sewer facilities. The subdivider shall
install all water and sanitary sewer facilities needed to serve the development
and shall extend all water and sanitary sewer mains and appurtenances necessary
to connect the development with the city's water supply and distribution system
and with the city's sanitary sewer system.
   (C)   City approval required for water and sewer system extensions.
Extension of water and sanitary sewer lines to serve newly subdivided or
platted land shall be authorized by the city only upon determination that all
facilities necessary to serve the development are adequate. All extensions of
water and sanitary lines must be approved by the city. If alternatives exist as
to these extensions, the city shall have the authority to determine the most
appropriate alternative. The city shall retain the authority to reject any
extension not deemed to be in the best interest of the city.
   (D)   On-site sewer systems. In locations where sanitary sewers are not
available and where there are no immediate prospects for the installation of
sanitary sewer, on-site sewer systems of an approved type may be installed in
conformity with the rules, regulations, and ordinances of Henderson County. In

(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.088 DRAINAGE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this section shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this section its most reasonable application. These
definitions are also defined in the Henderson County Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance.
      DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
      FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
         (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
         (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any surface.
      FLOODPLAIN. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from
any source (see definition of FLOODING above).
      FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   (B)   Compliance.
      (1)   All development plans, site plans and subdivision plats submitted
to the city shall comply with the provisions of these regulations and any other
applicable regulations. Those plats of developed property on which no new
structures or additional impervious coverage is planned shall be exempt from
the provisions of this section. This provision also includes accessory
structures over 200 square feet.
      (2)   The City of Tool Building Official and Director of Maintenance and
Operations shall make a site visit for the purposes of investigating the
current conditions of the property, before a permit is issued by the Tool
Building Department.
   (C)   Stormwater management system requirements.
      (1)   The City of Tool Building Official shall not approve any plat,
permit, replat, development application, plan or subdivision, regardless of the
zoning designation, which does not meet the minimum requirements of this
section in making adequate provision for control of the quantity of stormwater
and/or ground water run-off to the benefit of both future owners of property
within the subdivision and other lands within the watershed.
      (2)   The City of Tool Building Official has the authority and privilege
of requesting a drainage plan before a permit is issued. The Building Official
shall request recommendations and review from a third-party engineer, as
determined by the Building Official, within the development of any and all
lots. The costs of a requested drainage plan shall be applied to the total
permit fee, before the issuance of a permit.
      (3)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to design and
construct a system for the collection and transport of all stormwater run-off
flowing onto and generated within the property and/or subdivision in accordance
with:
         (a)   The requirements of these regulations;
         (b)   Good engineering practices;
         (c)   Approved plans;
         (d)   The principles of stormwater law established by the Texas Water
Code; and
         (e)   International Building Code.
   (D)   Basic design objectives. In general, the stormwater management system
shall be designed and constructed in a manner which promotes the development of
a network of both natural and built drainage ways throughout the community and
so as to:
      (1)   Retain natural floodplains in a condition that minimizes
interference with flood water conveyance, flood water storage, aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems, and ground and surface water;
      (2)   Reduce exposure of people and property to the flood hazard and
nuisance associated with inadequate control of run-off;
      (3)   Systematically reduce the existing level of flood damages;
      (4)   Ensure that corrective works are consistent with the overall goals
of the city;
      (5)   Minimize erosion and sedimentation problems and enhance water
quality;
      (6)   Plan for both the large flooding events and the smaller, more
frequent flooding by providing both major and minor drainage systems; and
      (7)   Minimize future operational and maintenance expenses.
   (E)   General design requirements.
      (1)   The storm drainage system shall be separate and independent of any
sanitary or septic sewer system and its use shall not interfere with the
operation and maintenance of road networks, roadways or utility systems.
      (2)   Each lot, site and block within the property shall be adequately
drained as prescribed in this section. Any use of retaining walls or similar
construction shall be indicated on the preliminary plat and the construction
plans will be required. This provision may require adjustments or a variance,
with respect to setbacks.
      (3)   The Building Official may, when he or she deems necessary for the
protection of the health, safety or welfare of the present and future
population, prohibit the subdivisions and/or development of any property which
lies within a designated regulatory floodway of any stream or watercourse.
      (4)   A stormwater drainage facility (pipes, inlets, channels, etc.)
shall be designed for a storm event of a 25-year return interval. Also, the
design engineer shall check the 100-year event to confirm there are not any
negative impacts to downstream properties. This ensures that property owners
are not causing another neighbor to experience higher flood elevations, leading
to home flooding during the 100-year event.
   (F)   Computations, plans and construction.
      (1)   Plans and computations for proposed drainage facilities shall be
certified with the seal of the design engineer and submitted to an engineer
either employed or contracted by the City of Tool for acceptance prior to
approval of construction plans. Approval shall be in writing from the selected
engineer.
      (2)   Computations for all drainage-related designs shall be submitted
with the plans for review. Data submitted shall include a drainage area map, a
summary of methodology employed and resulting data, land use and run-off
coefficient assumptions, and other pertinent hydrologic and hydraulic data.
      (3)   The city shall make such inspections as are deemed necessary to
assure proper installation. Neither the review nor approval of such plans nor
the inspection of the completed work will create any liability on the part of
the city.
   (G)   Drainage repair and installation.
      (1)   The city shall make such inspections and recommendations to provide
proper installation of drainage systems, on an as-needed basis as requested by
a property owner. The city shall make the best effort to ask the affected
property owner for cost-sharing measures for the repair, installation and
maintenance of existing drainage systems.
      (2)   Costs for the repair, installation and maintenance will be
determined by existing prices of the market and the City of Tool's Director of
Maintenance and Operations.
   (H)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any person who violates a provision or division of this section or
who does not comply with the requirements of this section shall upon conviction
by the Municipal Court of the city be subject to a fine not to exceed $500 for
each offense, not in compliance shall constitute a separate offense.
      (2)   If any provision of this section is found to be invalid or
unconstitutional, such provision shall be severed from this section, and the
remaining provisions shall remain in full effect.
(Ord. 2025-01, passed 3-20-2025)

all lots or tract sizes must conform to the regulations of the Zoning
Ordinance, including minimum area, width and depth.
   (B)   Lot width definition. The lot width is the minimum distance between
the side lot lines of a building lot measured along a straight line at the rear
of the required front yard and parallel to the street line or a line tangent
thereto, unless otherwise defined.

   (D)   Key lots. Where corner lots are key lots, the corner lot shall have a
front building line on both streets, unless said key lot is separated from
other lots by a dedicated street or alley.
   (E)   Lot depth. No lot shall be platted less than 100 feet in depth. In
cases where an irregularly shaped tract is platted into lots and remnant piece
of property is of sufficient area to plat one or more lots, the council may
waive the depth requirement to prevent a hardship on the developer.
   (F)   Lots on major streets. Lots facing or backing on major streets shall
be at least ten feet deeper than average lots facing on adjacent minor streets.
   (G)   Lots on drainage easements. Minimum usable lot depths for lots backing
on natural drainage easements shall be not less than 100 feet measured between
front lot line and drainage easement.
   (H)   Lot shape. Lots should be rectangular insofar as practicable. Sharp
angles between lot lines should be avoided. The ratio of depth to width should
not ordinarily exceed two and one-half times. Irregular shaped lots shall have
sufficient width at the building line to meet frontage requirements for the
appropriate zoning district.
   (I)   Lot lines. Side lot lines should be perpendicular or radial to street
frontage.
   (J)   Lot facing.

backing on major thoroughfares. Where lots have double frontage, a front
building line shall be established for each street.
      (3)   Front facing. Wherever feasible, each lot should face the front of
a similar lot across the street. In general, an arrangement placing adjacent
lots at right angles to each other should be avoided.
   (K)   Lot numbering. All lots are to be numbered consecutively within each
block. Lot numbering may be cumulative throughout the subdivision if the
numbering continues from block to block in a uniform manner that has been
approved on an overall preliminary plat.
   (L)   Driveway restrictions. Rear and side driveway access to major
thoroughfares shall be prohibited.
   (M)   (1)   Replatting. Any person who wishes to revise a subdivision plat
which has been previously filed for record must make an application of the
proposed revised plat to the City Council. The replat of the subdivision shall
meet all the requirements for a subdivision that may be pertinent. However, if
the subdivision as replatted does not require any appreciable alteration or
improvement of utility installations, streets, alleys building setback lines,
etc., then no engineering plans will be required.
      (2)   In the event the proposed replat involves property which has been
previously developed or zoned as single family or duplex residential use then
special requirements are as follows:
         (a)   After an application is filed for a replat affecting single
family and duplex property, the City Secretary shall cause a notice of the
application to be published in the official newspaper of the city at least 15
days before the date of the City Council meeting at which it is to be
considered. Such notice must include a statement of the time and place at which
the City Council will meet to consider the replat and to hear protests to the
revision at a public hearing. Additionally, written notice must be sent to all
owners of property located within 200 feet of the property upon which the
replat is requested. Such notice may be served by depositing the notice,
properly addressed and postage paid, at the local post office.
         (b)   If 20% or more of the property owners to whom notice has been
required to be given above file a written protest of the replatting before or
at the public hearing, then the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of
the City Council is required to approve the replat.
(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.090 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Block length. Blocks shall not be more than 1,320 feet in length.
   (B)   Block width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots
with a block width no less than 220 feet, except when prevented by the size of
the property or the need to backup to a major thoroughfare. Where no existing
subdivision controls, the block width of depth shall be platted to give lots
with a depth-to-width ratio of generally not more than two and one-half to one.
   (C)   Crosswalks. Crosswalk easements of 15 feet in width across blocks 800
feet in length shall be dedicated where deemed necessary by the City Council.
   (D)   Block numbering. Blocks are to be numbered consecutively within the
overall plat and/or sections of an overall plat as recorded only when previous
units of the subdivision have numbered blocks, otherwise blocks shall not be
numbered.
(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.091 BUILDING LINES.
   Building lines along all streets shall be shown on the final plat on lots
and shall provide the minimum setback for front, side, and rear streets as
required by the Zoning Ordinance for the relevant district (single-family,
residential, duplex, multifamily, commercial, retail office, mobile home,
industrial, etc.).
(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.092 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Size. The size of easements where alleys are not provided shall not be
less than ten feet on each side of rear lot lines. Easements along side lot
lines shall be not less than ten feet in width. However, while deemed necessary
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the City Council, such easements
may be required to be 20 feet in width.
   (B)   Use. Where necessary, easements shall be retained for poles, wires,
conduits, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, open drains, gas lines or
other utilities. Such easements may be required across parts of lots (including
side lines) other than as described above if the City Council determines that
same is needed. Any easements so established shall be maintained by the
property owner. All easements may be included in the computation of lot sizes,
with the exception of drainage easements, which will be in addition to the
specified lot size.
   (C)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way, channel or street, there shall be provided a storm easement or
drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with such course and of such
additional width as may be designated by the Zoning Administrator that will
bereasonably adequate for the purpose. Parallel streets or parkways may be
required in connection with these easements. The drainage shall be designed to
eliminate erosion of adjoining property and to facilitate routine maintenance.
(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.093 MONUMENTS.
   (A)   Monuments consisting of three-quarter inch diameter steel rods 24
inches long shall be placed at all corners of block lines, the point of
intersection of alley and block lines, and at points of intersections of curves
and tangents of the subdivision.
   (B)   Lot markers consisting of one-half inch diameter steel rods shall be
placed at all lot corners.
(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.094 RESTRICTIONS FOR PERMIT.
   No building permit nor any water, sewer, plumbing, or electrical permit
shall be issued by the city to the owners or any other person with respect to
any property in any subdivision covered by this chapter until:
   (A)   Such time as the developer and/or owner has complied with the
requirements of this chapter and the approved final plat regarding improvements
with respect to the block facing the street and/or streets on which the
property abuts, including the installation of streets with proper base and
paving, curbs and sewers and alleys;
   (B)   An escrow deposit has been made with the City Secretary, such deposit
being sufficient to pay for the cost of such improvements and being accompanied
by an agreement signed by the developer and/or owner authorizing the city to
make such improvements at prevailing private commercial rates, or to have the
same made by a private contractor and pay for the same from the escrow deposit.
Cost of such improvements is to be determined by the Zoning Administrator and
computed on a private commercial rate basis. Should the developer and/or owner
fail or refuse to install the required improvements within the time stated in
such written agreement, the city shall in no case be obligated to make such
improvements itself, except that such deposit may be used by the owner and/or
developer as a progress payment as the work progresses by making certified
requisition to the City Secretary when supported by evidence of work done; or
   (C)   The developer and/or owner files a corporate surety bond with the City
Secretary in a sum equal to the cost of such improvements for the designated

§ 154.096 VARIANCES.
   (A)   When a subdivider can show that a provision of these regulations would
cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to and where, because of some
condition peculiar to the site, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and/or the City Council a departure may be made without destroying
the intent of such provisions, the City Council may authorize a variance. The
Council shall consider the nature of the proposed usage of land involved, the
existing usage of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside
or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of a such variance
on traffic conditions and public health, safety, convenience, and welfare of
individuals in the vicinity. No variances will be granted unless the Council
finds the following:
      (1)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land
involved such that the strict application of the provisions of the chapter
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land;
      (2)   The variances are necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the applicant and the granting of the variance
will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare of
individuals, or injurious to other properties in the area; and
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing
the orderly subdivision of other lands in the area in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Pecuniary hardship to the subdivider, standing alone, shall not be
deemed to constitute undue hardship.
   (C)   Any variance thus authorized is required to be entered in writing into
the minutes of the Commission and/or the City Council and the reason which
justified the departure to be set forth, and such variance must be authorized
by affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the entire members of the
City Council.
(Ord. passed 4-20-2000)
§ 154.097 INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The city shall be given opportunity to inspect all phases of the

AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT (RA)
§ 155.030 PURPOSE.
   The intent of this district is to provide for areas of the city on the outer
edge of urbanized development in which urban usage is usually premature due to
the lack of adequate utility service or transportation systems. It is likely
that this district will be changed to more intense urban zoning districts as
utility services can be feasibly extended and the undeveloped areas within
existing service limits are used up or become in short supply. Uses within this
district are mostly related to farming or semi-urban functions and are not
necessarily compatible with higher density residential development.

MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT-1 (MF-1)
§ 155.060 PURPOSE.
   The intent of this district is to provide for an efficient and economic use
of land through a mixture of medium density, multiple-family housing types
together with such public and semi-public buildings and facilities and
accessory structures as may be necessary and are compatible with such
residential development. The provisions of this district are intended to
encourage such development projects to locate within close proximity to
activity centers; to serve as a buffer between low intensity land uses and
other more intense land uses; to avoid undue traffic congestion on minor
streets by directing such development to abut upon or have relatively close
access to major transportation arteries; to provide for the development of such
projects in areas where such projects could be logically integrated with or
located near medium density, single-family areas or in transitional areas on
land where the clustering of units would permit the most effective utilization
of such land while preserving open space and other natural features; to
encourage privacy, internal stability, attractiveness, order and efficiency in
these areas by providing for adequate light, air and usable open space for
dwellings and related facilities through the careful design and consideration
of the proper functional relationship among uses permitted; and to provide
policies which will encourage such residential development to occur where

THOROUGHFARE DISTRICT (THOR)
§ 155.165 PURPOSE.
   The Thoroughfare District is designed to provide for the diverse uses that
can take advantage of the access provided by a major arterial or freeway,
without sacrificing the integrity of the thoroughfare or freeway in its primary
function as a means of moving vehicular traffic through the community. This
district is established to create an attractive, higher intensity use corridor
composed primarily of office, retail, limited light industrial and commercial
uses, hotels, motels and restaurants. To protect the integrity of the
thoroughfare, minimum lot sizes will be larger, setback requirements will be
greater, and more stringent access restrictions will be imposed in the THOR
District than in other commercial and Industrial districts. The THOR District
should have increased water, sewer and drainage capacity, and increased fire
protection to accommodate the higher intensity uses typically found in the
district. The THOR District is an overlay district, meaning that the
regulations within the district are in addition to the base district that is
being overlaid.

with the planning on which it is based and will not be harmful to the
community. A PD District may be used to permit new and innovative concepts in
land utilization. While great flexibility is given to provide special
restrictions which will allow development not otherwise permitted, procedures
are established herein to ensure against misuse of the increased flexibility.

      (2)   The plan shall show the applicant’s intent for the use of the land
within the proposed Planned Development District in a graphic manner and shall
be supported by written documentation of proposals and standards for
development.
         (a)   A conceptual plan for residential land use shall show general
use, thoroughfares, and preliminary lotting arrangements. For residential
development which does not propose platted lots, the conceptual plan shall set
forth the size, type and location of buildings and building sites, access,
density, building height, fire lanes, screening, parking areas, landscaped
areas and other pertinent development data.
         (b)   A conceptual plan for uses other than residential uses shall set
forth the land use proposals in a manner to adequately illustrate the type and
nature of the proposed development. Data which may be submitted by the
applicant, or required by the City Council, may include, but is not limited to,
the types of use(s), topography and boundary of the PD area, physical features
of the site, existing streets, alleys and easements, location of future public
facilities, building heights and locations, parking ratios and other
information to adequately describe the proposed development and to provide data
for approval which is to be used in drafting the final development plan.
         (c)   Changes of detail which do not alter the basic relationship of
the proposed development to adjacent property and which do not alter the uses
permitted or increase the density, building height, or coverage of the site and
which do not decrease the off-street parking ratio, reduce the yards provided
at the boundary of the site, or significantly alter the landscape plans as
indicated on the approved conceptual plan may be authorized by the Building
Official or his or her designated representative. If an agreement cannot be
reached regarding whether or not a detail site plan conforms to the original
concept plan, the City Council shall determine the conformity.
   (B)   Development plan or detailed site plan.
      (1)   This plan shall set forth the final plans for development of the
Planned Development District and shall conform to the data presented and
approved on the conceptual plan. Approval of the development plan shall be the
basis for issuance of a building permit. The development plan may be submitted
for the total area of the PD or for any section or part as approved on the
conceptual plan. The development plan must be approved by the City Council. A
public hearing on approval of the development plan shall be required at the
Council level, unless such a hearing is waived pursuant to division (C)(1)
below at the time of conceptual plan approval in the original amending
ordinance.
      (2)   The development plan shall include:
         (a)   A site inventory analysis including a scale drawing showing
existing vegetation, natural water courses, creeks or bodies of water, and an
analysis of planned changes in such natural features as a result of the
development. This should include a delineation of any flood prone areas;
         (b)   A scale drawing showing any proposed public or private streets
and alleys; building sites or lots; and areas reserved as parks, parkways,
playgrounds, utility easements, school sites, street widening and street
changes; the points of ingress and egress from existing streets; general
location and description of existing and proposed utility services, including
size of water and sewer mains; the location and width for all curb cuts and the
land area of all abutting sites and the zoning classification thereof on an
accurate survey of the tract with the topographical contour interval of not
more than five feet;
         (c)   A site plan for proposed building complexes showing the location
of separate buildings, and between buildings and property lines, street lines
and alley lines. Also to be included on the site plan is a plan showing the
arrangement and provision of off-street parking;
         (d)   A landscape plan showing screening walls, ornamental planting,
wooded areas and trees to be planted; and
         (e)   An architectural plan showing elevations and signage style to be
used throughout the development in all districts except single-family and two-
family may be required by the City Council if deemed appropriate. Any or all of
the required information may be incorporated on a single drawing, if such
drawing is clear, and can be evaluated by the Building Official, or his or her
designated representative.
   (C)   Procedure for establishment.
      (1)   The procedure for establishing a Planned Development District shall
follow the procedure for zoning amendments as set forth in § 155.284.
      (2)   This procedure is expanded as follows for approval of conceptual
and development plans.
         (a)   Separate public hearings shall be held by the City Council for
the approval of the conceptual plan and the development plan or any section of
the development plan, unless such requirement is waived by the City Council
upon a determination that a single public hearing is adequate. A single public
hearing is adequate when:
            1.   The applicant submits adequate data with the request for the
Planned Development District to fulfill the requirements for both plans;
            2.   Information on the concept plan is sufficient to determine the
appropriate use of the land and the detail site plan will not deviate
substantially from it; and
            3.   The requirement is waived at the time the amending ordinance
is approved. If the requirement is waived, the conditions shall be specifically
stated in the amending ordinance.
         (b)   The ordinance establishing the Planned Development District
shall not be approved until the conceptual plan is approved.
         (c)   The development plan may be approved in sections. When the plan
is approved in sections, the separate approvals by the City Council for the
initial and subsequent sections will be required.
         (d)   An initial development plan shall be submitted for approval
within six months from the approval of the conceptual plan or some portion of
the conceptual plan. If the development plan is not submitted within six
months, the conceptual plan is subject to re-approval by the City Council. If
the entire project is not completed within two years, the City Council may
review the original conceptual plan to ensure its continued validity.
         (e)   Regardless of whether the public hearing is waived for the
development plan, approval by the City Council is still required.

any district, or a public utility or public service building of a ground area
and of a height at variance with those provided for in the district in which
such public utility or public service building is permitted to be located, when
found reasonably necessary for the public health, convenience, safety or
general welfare;
         (b)   To grant a permit for the extension of a use, height, or area
regulations into an adjoining district, where the boundary line of the district
divides a lot in a single ownership on the effective date of this chapter;
         (c)   Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of
the districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make
necessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience;
         (d)   Permit land within 300 feet of a multi-family dwelling to be
improved for the parking spaces required in connection with a multi-family
dwelling, but only when there is positive assurance that such land will be used
for such purpose during the existence of the multi-family dwelling; and
         (e)   To determine in cases of uncertainty the classification of any
use not specifically named in this chapter.
      (4)   Variances. The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal
in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and
substantial justice done, owing to and including the following special
conditions:
         (a)   Permit a variance in the area, setback, height and/or coverage
requirements of any district where there are unusual and practical difficulties
or unnecessary hardships in the implementation of these provisions due to an
irregular shape of the lot, topography or other conditions, provided such
variance will not adversely affect any adjoining property or the general
welfare; and
         (b)   Authorize upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a
strict application of the terms of this chapter relating to the construction or
alterations of buildings or structures will impose upon him unusual and
practical difficulties or particular hardship, such variances from the strict
application of the terms of this chapter as are in harmony with its general
purpose and intent. A variance shall be granted only when the Board is
satisfied that a such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the
applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or
difficulty so great as to warrant a variance from the Community Development
Plan of the city, and at the same time protect the value and integrity of
nearby property.

§ 155.293 CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Requirements. Certificates of occupancy shall be required for any of
the following:
      (1)   Occupancy and use of a building hereafter erected or structurally
altered;
      (2)   Change in use of an existing building to a different
classification;
      (3)   Occupancy and use of vacant land, except agricultural use;
      (4)   Any change in the use of a nonconforming use; and
      (5)   No such occupancy, use or change of use shall take place until a
certificate of occupancy therefor shall have been issued by the Building
Inspector.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   Written application for a certificate of occupancy for a new
building or for an existing building which is to be altered shall be made at
the same time as the application for the building permit for such building.
Said certificate shall be issued within three days after a written request for
the same has been made to said Building Inspector after the erection or
alteration of such building or part thereof has been completed in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   A fee to be determined by the City Council shall be paid to the
City Secretary for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy on all
occupancies within the B-1, B-2, I-1, I-2 and MH-1 zoned districts. No fee or
permit is required for single-family detached, multiple-family residential and
manufactured home subdivisions. All persons owning or operating any structure,
building or business within the city shall have one year from the date of
adoption of this chapter to comply with this provision.
      (3)   All certificates of occupancy issued to any person or persons
owning or operating any structure, building or business within the corporate
limits are non-transferable from the location or owner shown on the face of
such permits.
   (C)   Procedures for vacant land or a change in use. Written application for
a certificate of occupancy for the use of vacant land, or for a change in the
use of land or a building, or for a change in a nonconforming use, as herein
provided, shall be made to said Building Inspector. If the proposed use is in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, the certificate of occupancy
therefore shall be issued within three days after the application has been
made.
   (D)   Contents and filing of certificate of occupancy. Every certificate of
occupancy shall state that the building or the proposed use of a building or
land complies with all provisions of law. A record of all certificates of
occupancy shall be kept on file in the office of the Building Inspector and
copies shall be furnished on request to any person having proprietary or
tenancy Interests in the building or land affected.
   (E)   Temporary certificate. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate,
a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Building Inspector
for a period not exceeding six months, during the completion of alterations or
during partial occupancy of a building pending its completion. Such temporary
certificates shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective
rights, duties or obligations of the owners of the city relating to the use of
occupancy of the premises or any other matter covered by this chapter.
(Ord. passed 4-4-2000)
§ 155.294 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Petition. Any person or corporation having a proprietary interest in
any property may petition the City Council for a change, supplement, or
amendment to the provisions of this chapter or the City Council may on its own
motion institute a study and proposal for changes, supplements and amendments
in the public interest.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   The City Council may, from time to time, amend, supplement or
change by ordinance the districts or the regulations herein established.
      (2)   The City Council shall hold a public hearing on any request for any
amendment, supplement or change prior to approving or denying the request.
      (3)   Written notice of all public hearings before the City Council on
any proposed amendment, supplement or change shall be sent to all owners of
real property lying within 200 feet of the property on which the change is
requested. Such notice shall be given not less than ten days before the date
set for hearing by posting such notice, properly addressed and postage paid, to
each taxpayer as the ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll.
      (4)   Notice of such hearing shall also be given by publication in a
paper of general circulation in the city, stating the time and place of such
hearing, which time shall not be earlier than 15 days from the first date of
publication.
      (5)   If a protest against a proposed amendment, supplement or change has
been filed with the City Secretary in accordance with this division (B)(5),
such change shall not become effective except by favorable vote of three-
fourths of all the members of the City Council.
         (a)   The protest must be written and signed by the owners of at least
20% of either:
            1.   The area of the lots or land included in such proposed change;
or
            2.   The area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area
covered by the proposed change and extending 200 feet from that area.
         (b)   In computing the percentage of land area under this division (B)
(5), the area of streets and alleys shall be included.
      (6)   Amendments to this chapter not involving a particular property but
involving a change in the zoning regulations generally do not require notice to
individual property owners. In such cases, notice of the required public
hearing shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the city,
stating the time and location of the public hearing, which time shall not be
earlier than 15 days from the date of such publication.
   (C)   Limitation of resubmission of petition. No amendment, supplement,
change or repeal of any section of this chapter, which has been legally
rejected by the City Council on an appeal or petition by an appellant, may be
reconsidered before the expiration of one year from the date of the original
action.
   (D)   Factors in amendment considerations. In making its determination
regarding an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, the City Council shall consider
the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the use permitted by the proposed change will be
appropriate in the immediate area concerned and the impact of the proposed
change on the general area and the city as a whole;
      (2)   Whether the proposed change is in accord with any existing or
proposed plans for providing public schools, streets, water supply, sanitary
sewers and other utilities to the area;
      (3)   The amount of vacant land currently classified for similar
development in the vicinity and elsewhere in the city, and any special
circumstances, which may make a substantial part of such vacant land unsuitable
for development;
      (4)   The rate at which land is being developed in the same zoning
classification as the request, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed
change;
      (5)   The manner in which other areas designated for similar development
will be, or are likely to be, affected if the proposed amendment is approved
and whether such designation for other areas should also be modified; and
      (6)   Any other factors which will substantially affect the public
health, safety, morals or general welfare.

§ 2 NOTES TO AREA REGULATIONS.
1.   Exception to lot area requirement.
   a.   A lot/tract having less area than required that was an official lot of
record at the time of adoption of this chapter may be used for a single-family
dwelling.
   b.   No lot/tract existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall be
reduced in area below the minimum requirements set forth in the respective
district.
2.   Special front yard regulations.
   a.   The front yard setback shall be measured from the property line to the
front face of the building, covered porch, covered terrace or attached
accessory buildings.
   b.   Open and unenclosed terraces and porches may project into the required
front yard for a distance not to exceed five feet, provided that no support
structure for such extensions shall be located within the required front yard.
   c.   Every part of a required front yard shall be open and unobstructed from
a point 30 inches above the general ground level of the graded lot to the sky.
The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply, however, to living plant
material and landscaping, lighting fixtures, flagpoles, mailboxes, basketball
goal supports and similar structures, fountains or overhead service lines and
poles for utilities, which shall be situated and constructed in accordance with
the applicable codes of the city.
   d.   On any corner lot for which front and side yards are required, no wall,
fence, structure, sign, tree or other planting or sloped terrace or embankment
may be maintained higher than three feet above the street grade so as to cause
danger or hazard to traffic by obstructing the view of the intersection from a
point 30 feet back from the right-of-way corner. Visual clearance shall be
provided in all zoning districts so that no fence, wall, vegetation,
architectural screen, earth mounding or landscaping obstructs the vision of a
motor vehicle driver approaching any street, alley or driveway intersection.
   e.   On corner lots, the front yard setback shall be observed along the
frontage of both intersecting streets (unless shown specifically otherwise on
an approved final plat).
   f.   Where a building line has been established by a plat approved by the
City Council or by ordinance and such line requires a greater or lesser front
yard setback than is prescribed by this chapter for the district in which the
building line is located, the required front yard shall comply with the
building line so established by such ordinance or plat provided no such
building line shall be less than 20 feet, except as approved under a planned
development.
   g.   Where the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting
streets is divided by two or more zoning districts, the front yard shall comply
with the requirements of the most restrictive district for the entire frontage.
   h.   Where lots have double frontage, running through from one street to
another, a required front yard shall be provided on both streets unless a
building line for accessory buildings has been established along one frontage
on the plat or by ordinance, in which event only one required front yard need
be observed.
   i.   Where a future right-of-way line has been established for future
widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, the
front or side yard shall be measured from the future right-of-way line.
   j.   Accessory buildings or structures shall not be located in front of the
main structure nor within the designated front yard of any lot or parcel.
3.   Special side yard regulations.
   a.   The ordinary extensions of window sills, awnings, belt courses,
cornices, roof overhangs, eaves, chimneys and other architectural features may
extend an additional 24 inches into a required yard.
   b.   When a nonresidentially zoned lot or tract abuts upon a zoning district
boundary line dividing that lot or tract from a residentially zoned lot or
tract, a minimum side yard of ten feet shall be provided on the nonresidential
property. An opaque wood fence or masonry wall having a minimum height of six
feet above the average grade of the residential property shall be constructed
on nonresidential property adjacent to the common side or rear property line.
   c.   Accessory structures are required to have a five-foot side yard
setback, except where the lot abuts a collector or major street in which case
the standard provisions of this chapter prevail.
   d.   On any corner lot for which front and side yards are required, no wall,
fence, structure, sign, tree or other planting or sloped terrace or embankment
may be maintained higher than three feet above the street grade so as to cause
danger or hazard to traffic by obstructing the view of the intersection from a
point 30 feet back
from the right-of-way corner. Visual clearance shall be provided in all zoning
districts so that no fence, wall, vegetation, architectural screen, earth
mounding or landscaping obstructs the vision of a motor vehicle driver
approaching any street, alley or driveway intersection.
   e.   Where a multi-family structure (apartment building) is erected so as to
create inner courts, the faces of all opposite wails in such courts shall be a
minimum distance of 30 feet apart and no balcony or canopy shall extend into
such court area for a distance greater than five feet.
4.   Special rear yard regulations.
   a.   The required rear yard shall be open and unobstructed from a point 30
inches above the average elevation of the graded rear yard, except for
accessory buildings as permitted herein.
   b.   Eaves, covered porches and roof extensions without structural support
in the rear yard may extend into the rear yard a distance not to exceed four
feet.
   c.   Accessory structures shall have a minimum rear yard setback of five
feet. Structures attached to the main structure, such as garages and carports,
are considered to be part of the main structure and are not considered to be
accessory structures.
   d.   The minimum distance from the public right-of-way to the entrance of a
garage or carport shall be 15 feet.
   e.   When a nonresidentially zoned lot or tract abuts upon a zoning district
boundary line dividing that lot or tract from a residentially zoned lot or
tract, a minimum rear yard of ten feet shall be provided on the nonresidential
property. An opaque wood fence or masonry wall having a minimum height of six
feet above the average grade of the residential property shall be constructed
on nonresidential property adjacent to the common side or rear property line.
   f.   Where a multi-family structure (apartment building) is erected so as to
create inner courts, the faces of all opposite walls in such courts shall be a
minimum distance of 30 feet apart and no balcony or canopy shall extend into
such court area for a distance greater than five feet.
5.   Special height regulations.
   a.   Church steeples, domes, spires, flagpoles, roof gables, chimneys and
vent stacks may extend for an additional height not to exceed 15 feet from the
maximum height limit of a structure to the highest point of any church steeple,
dome, spire, flagpole, roof gable, chimney or vent stack.
   b.   Municipal water towers and sports lighting facilities, utility poles
and utility towers shall be specifically exempted from the maximum height
restrictions imposed by this chapter.
   c.   Water tanks, cooling towers, school, institutional buildings and
ancillary buildings and facilities of a religious organization, such as a
gymnasium or classroom building, may be erected to exceed 25 feet in height,
provided that one additional foot shall be added to the front, rear and side
yard setback requirements for each foot that such structures exceed 25 feet in
height. Such structure shall not exceed 36 feet in height, except as provided
in § 5.a above. The requirements established herein for additional setbacks
shall not apply to the sanctuary building of a religious organization that is
in excess of 25 feet in height.
§ 3 YARD, HEIGHT AND SIZE REGULATIONS; ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
1.   Detached accessory structures shall be at least five feet from any
principal structure on the same lot within residential districts and shall be
considered in the calculating of the total coverage.
2.   Accessory buildings shall not be erected in any required front yard.
3.   No accessory structure, excluding fences or walls, shall be closer to any
property line than the required yard setbacks (as measured from the overhang of
the accessory structure).
4.   Accessory buildings may not be placed in the required side yard if the
side yard lot line abuts a street.
5.   Garages entered from an alley shall be set back from the lot line adjacent
to the alley a minimum of 20 feet.
6.   An accessory structure may not exceed one story.
7.   An accessory building shall not exceed the interior square footage of the
principal structure or 600 square feet, whichever is less.
8.   No accessory building may be placed so as to negatively impact drainage on
any adjacent lot by diversion or impoundment of stormwater flows.
9.   An accessory structure must closely resemble the color and scheme of the
principal structure.
10.   On residential lots of two or less, with a minimum of 5,000 square feet,
the homeowner may construct one accessory structure, up to 1,000 square feet if
it meets all setbacks.
11.   On residential combined lots of three or more, the homeowner may have one
accessory structure with a maximum of 2,000 square feet but may not exceed the
square footage of the principal structure. A minor accessory structure can be
built, in addition, but may not exceed 200 square feet.
