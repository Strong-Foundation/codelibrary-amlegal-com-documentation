not exceeding limits set by Council or State law. All contracts for
expenditures involving more than the set limits must be approved by the
Council. All contracts or purchases involving more than the limits set, shall
be let as provided by law or ordinance; provided that the Council, or City
Manager in such cases as he is authorized to contract for the City, shall have
the right to reject any and all bids.

SEC. 9.15. POWER TO TAX.
   The Council shall have the power to levy, assess and collect an annual tax
upon real and personal property within the City to the maximum provided by the

   All real and personal property within the City of Mansfield, not expressly
exempted by law, shall be subject to annual taxation as provided herein except
as may be required by State law.
(Amended: 5-7-88)
SEC. 9.17. TAXES - WHEN DUE AND PAYABLE.
   All taxes due the City of Mansfield shall be payable at the office of the
City Tax Assessor-Collector and may be paid at any time after the tax rolls for
the year have been completed and approved, which shall be not later than
October 1st. Taxes shall be paid on or before January 31st and all such taxes
not paid on or prior to such date shall be deemed delinquent and shall be
subject to such penalty and interest as prescribed by State statute. The
Council may provide further by ordinance that all taxes, either current or
delinquent, due the City of Mansfield, may be paid by installments. Failure to
levy and assess taxes through omission in preparation of the approve tax roll
shall not relieve the person, firm or corporation so omitted from obligation to
pay such current or past due taxes as shown to be payable by recheck of the
rolls and receipt for the years in question.
(Amended: 5-7-88)
SEC. 9.18. TAX LIENS.
   The tax levied by the City is hereby declared to be a lien, charge, or
encumbrance upon the property as of January 1st of each year, upon which the
tax is due, which lien, charge or encumbrance the City is entitled to enforce
and foreclose in any court having jurisdiction over the same, and the lien,
charge or encumbrance on the property is such as to give the State Courts
jurisdiction to enforce and foreclose said lien on the property on which the
tax is due, not only as against any resident of this State or person whose
residence is unknown, but as against nonresidents. All taxes upon real estate
shall especially be a lien and a charge upon the property upon which the taxes
are due, and such lien may be foreclosed in any court having jurisdiction. Such
lien shall be, prior to all other claims, and no gift, sale, assignment or
transfer of any kind, or judicial writ of any kind, can ever defeat such lien.
   In addition to the liens herein provided, on the first day of January of any
year the owner of real and personal property subject to taxation by the City
shall be personally liable for the taxes due thereon for such year. The City
shall have the power to sue for and recover personal judgment for taxes without
foreclosure, or to foreclose its lien or liens, or to recover both personal
judgment and foreclosure. In any such suit where it appears that the
description of any property in the City assessment rolls is insufficient to
identify such property, the City shall have the right to plead a good
description of the property intended to be assessed, to prove the same, and to
have its judgment foreclosing the tax lien and/or personal judgment against the
owner for such taxes.

SEC. 11.04. RIGHT OF REGULATION.
   All grants, renewals, extensions, or amendments of public utility
franchises, whether it be so provided in the ordinance or not, shall be subject
to the right of the City:
   (a)   To repeal the same by ordinance at any time for failure to begin

   The consent of abutting and adjacent property owners shall not be required

shall ever be construed to deprive any such property owner of any right of
action for damage or injury to his property as now or hereafter provided by
law.

   All extensions of public utilities within the City limits shall become a
part of the aggregate property of the public utility, shall be operated as

maintain any extension shall terminate with the original grant and shall be

under a franchise hereafter granted, such right shall be terminated at the same
time and under the same conditions as the original grant.
SEC. 11.08. TEMPORARY PERMITS.
   Permits unconditionally revocable at the will of the Council for minor or
temporary privileges in the streets, public ways and public places of the City
may be granted and revoked by resolution from time to time, and such permits
shall not be deemed franchises as the term is used in this Charter.
(Amended: 5-7-88)
SEC. 11.09. OTHER CONDITIONS.
   All franchises heretofore granted are recognized as contracts between the
City and the grantee, and the contractual rights as contained in any such
franchises shall not be impaired by the provisions of this Charter, except that
the power of the City to exercise the right of eminent domain in the
acquisition of any utility property is in all things reserved, and except the
general power of the city heretofore existing and herein provided for to
regulate the rates and services of a utility, which shall include the right to
require adequate and reasonable extension of plant and service and the
maintenance of the plant fixtures at the standard necessary to render the
highest reasonable quality of utility service to the public. Every public
utility franchise hereafter granted shall be held subject to all the terms and
conditions contained in the various sections of this article whether or not
such terms are specifically mentioned in the franchises. Nothing in this
Charter shall operate to limit in any way, as specifically stated, the
discretion of the Council or the electors of the City in imposing terms and
conditions as may be reasonable in connection with any franchise grant
including the right to require such compensation or rental as may be permitted
by the laws of the State of Texas.
SEC. 11.10. FRANCHISE RECORDS.
   Within six (6) months after this Charter takes effect, every public utility

maintain a public record of public utility franchises.
SEC. 11.11. ACCOUNTS OF MUNICIPALLY OWNED UTILITIES.

City, in such manner as to show the true and complete financial results of such
City ownership and operation, including all assets, appropriately subdivided
into different classes, all liability subdivided by classes, depreciation
reserve, other reserves, and surplus; also revenues; operating expenses
including depreciation interest payments, rental, and other disposition of
annual income. The accounts shall show the actual capital cost to the City of
each public utility owned, also the cost of all extensions, additions, and
improvements and the source of the funds expended for such capital purposes.
They shall show as nearly as possible the cost of any service furnished to or
rendered by any such utility to any other City or governmental department. The
Council shall annually cause to be made by a certified public accountant, and

and the financial results of such City ownership and operation, giving the
information specified in this section and such additional data as the Council
shall seem expedient.

City under such terms and conditions as may appear to be for the best interests
of the City.
   (b)   The Council shall have the power and authority to prescribe the kind
of materials used within or beyond the limits of the City where it furnishes
the service, and to inspect the same and require them to be kept in good order
and condition at all times and to make such rules and regulations, as shall be
necessary and proper, and prescribe penalties for noncompliance with same.
SEC. 11.13. REGULATION OF RATES.

ordinance the rates, charges and fares of every public utility franchise holder
operating in the City, provided that no such ordinance shall be passed as an

the rendering of such service; and
      (3)   Any additional evidence required by Council.
   (c)   The Council may, if not satisfied with the sufficiency of the legal
evidence furnished by the public service, select and employ rate consultants
and auditors to investigate any requests or changes in rates, charges or fares.

reasonable and necessary expenses incurred.

this Charter and ordinances enacted pursuant hereto shall, in the order
mentioned, be applicable to the City of Mansfield. The City shall also have the

CODE OF ETHICS AND CONDUCT FOR CITY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND BOARD AND COMMITTEE
MEMBERS
§ 30.40 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that the proper
operation of democratic government requires that city elected officials and
members of boards and committees be independent, impartial and responsible only
to the people of the city, that governmental decisions and policy should be
made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that no city elected
official or member of any board, commission or committee should have any
interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in any
business, transaction or professional activity or incur any obligation of any
nature which is in conflict with the proper discharge of his or her duties in
the public interest; that public offices are positions of public trust imposing
the duty of a fiduciary upon all office holders, who are not to use their
public position for personal gain, and that the public should have confidence
in the integrity of its government. To implement such a policy, the City
Council deems it advisable to enact this Code of Ethics and Conduct for all
elected city officers and board and committee members, whether elected or
appointed, paid or unpaid, to serve not only as a guide for official conduct of
the city’s public servants, but also as a basis for discipline for those who
refuse to abide by its terms. The Code of Ethics and Conduct is cumulative of
other ordinances, city charter provisions and state statutes defining and
prohibiting conflict of interest.
   (B)   This Code of Ethics and Conduct is not intended to be nor shall it be
used as a political weapon to intimidate or embarrass persons affected.

§ 30.45 DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Every officer or advisory board member must file a conflicts
disclosure statement as required by Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Chapter 176.
   (B)   If any officer or advisory board member has a substantial interest in
any person, group or business entity, or real property involved in any decision
pending before such officer or advisory board member, or the body of which he
or she is a member, such officer or advisory board member shall disclose such
interest as provided in division (D) below and shall not, except as provided in
division (D) below, discuss the substance of the matter at any time with any
other member of the board of which he or she is a member or any other body
which will vote on the matter or otherwise participate in the consideration of
the matter.
   (C)   If any of the following interests are involved in any decision pending
before any city or advisory board member, or the body of which he is a member,
such officer or advisory board member must disclose such interest as provided
in division (D) below, but he shall be permitted to vote on and participate in
the consideration of such matter:
      (1)   A decision concerning a bank or other financial institution from
which the officer or advisory board member has a home mortgage, automobile
loan, or other installment loan, if the loan is not currently in default, was
originally for a term of more than two years and cannot be accelerated except
for failure to make payments according to the terms thereof;
      (2)   A decision concerning a bank or other financial institution in
which the officer or advisory board member holds a savings account, checking
account or certificate of deposit and which is fully insured by the U.S.
government or an agency thereof;
      (3)   A decision concerning a business entity with which the officer or
advisory board member has a retail or credit card account;
      (4)   A decision concerning the approval of substitution of collateral by
a city depository bank;
      (5)   A decision concerning real property in which the officer-or
advisory board member has a substantial interest if it is not reasonably
foreseeable that such decision would have a special economic effect on the
value of the property, distinguishable from the effect on the public (See Tex.
Loc. Gov’t Code, § 171.004).
   (D)   A city officer or advisory board member shall disclose the existence
of any substantial interest in any person, business entity or real property
involved in any decision pending before such officer or advisory board member,
or the body of which he is a member. To comply with this section, a city
officer or advisory board member shall, prior to any discussion or
determination of the matter, either file an affidavit of disclosure as required
by Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 171.004 or, if not so required, shall publicly
disclose in the official records of the city to the city secretary the nature
of the interest. In disclosing a substantial interest in a business entity, a
city officer or advisory board member shall not be required to disclose the
dollar amount of any income that he or she receives from the business entity.
   (E)   Where the interest of a city officer or advisory board member in the
subject matter of a vote or decision is remote or incidental, the city officer
or advisory board member may participate in the vote or decision and need not
disclose the interest.
      (1)   “Remote interest” means an interest of a person or entity,
including a city officer or advisory board member, who would be affected in the
same way as the general public. The interest of a council member in the
property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges or a comprehensive
zoning ordinance or similar decisions is incidental to the extent that the
council member would be affected in common with the general public.
      (2)   “Incidental interest” means an interest in a person, entity or
property which is not a substantial interest and which has insignificant value,
or which would be affected only in a de minimis fashion by a decision. This
section does not establish dollar limits on the terms “insignificant value” and
“de minimis” which shall have their usual meanings and be subject to
interpretation on a case by case basis.

or ordinances of the city, or the laws of the State of Texas, if that person

of the code by one or more such persons. At the direction of the City Council,
the City Attorney shall have the power to investigate any such complaint, to
initiate any suit, to file any complaint in municipal court, and to prosecute
any such complaint or action on behalf of the city where such complaint or
action is appropriate against a city officer or board member, other than a
member of the City Council.
   (C)   In matters where it is alleged that a member of the City Council
violated the code, the City Council may direct the City Attorney to investigate
as in division (B) above, or if the Council feels the alleged conduct is an
extreme violation of the code, the Council may select an outside, independent
attorney to investigate or prosecute any apparent violation of this subchapter

from a list of five experienced, qualified attorneys to be nominated by the
City Attorney. At the direction of the City Council, such independent attorney
shall have the power to investigate any such complaint, to initiate any suit,
to file any complaint in municipal court, and to prosecute any such complaint
or action on behalf of the city where such complaint or action is appropriate
against a member of the City Council.
   (D)   Any person who believes that a violation of any portion of the code
has occurred may file a complaint with the City Council which may then proceed
as provided in divisions (B) or (C) above. However, nothing in the code shall
be construed to prevent complainants from instituting direct legal action
through the appropriate judicial authority.

§ 30.48 ADVISORY OPINIONS.
   (A)   Where any officer or advisory board member has a doubt as to the
applicability of any provision of the code to a particular situation, or as to
the definition of terms used herein, he may apply to the City Attorney for an
advisory opinion. The officer or advisory board member shall have the

the applicability of provisions of the code before such advisory opinion is
made.
   (B)   The City Attorney shall only issue advisory opinions concerning how
the code applies prospectively to a particular situation, or how the definition
of terms used herein applies prospectively to such a situation. The City
Attorney shall not issue advisory opinions to city officer or advisory board
members in matters when a complaint is already pending with the City Council or
the situation in question has already occurred. These matters shall be handled
as provided in §
34.46 hereof.
   (C)   Until amended or revoked, any advisory opinion shall be binding on the
city, the City Council, and the City Attorney in any subsequent actions
concerning the public officer or advisory board member who sought the opinion
and acted on it in good faith, unless material facts were omitted or misstated
in the request for the advisory opinion. Such opinion shall not be binding in
any judicial proceedings initiated by any private citizen.

§ 30.49 PENALTIES; FORFEITED POSITION; EXEMPTIONS; INJUNCTIONS.

neglects or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the
provisions of the code shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than
$500 for each violation. Each day that a violation continues or is permitted to
exist shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   Whenever the City Council has determined that any officer or advisory
board member has violated any provision of the code, such officer or advisory
board member shall be subject to discipline, including forfeiture of his or her
office or position. Any removal of an official from elected office shall be
done in accordance with applicable state laws. The code shall be construed to
prohibit any such officer or advisory board member from being re-elected, or

addressed to regain eligibility.
   (B)   An application for a tax exemption shall be initiated by the owner of

maintained in good repair and in operable condition to avoid decay, damage,
structural failure and hazardous or unsafe conditions. Generally:
      (1)   Exterior surfaces of all structures (main structure and accessory
structures) shall be clean, maintained, protected and weathertight.
      (2)   Repainting/paint touch-ups shall closely match the existing paint
colors and applied at reasonable intervals.
      (3)   Damaged, loose, or rotted materials/details shall be reestablished,
repaired or replaced. All joints or cracks shall be weatherproofed
appropriately by proper maintenance.
      (4)   Exterior facades shall be clean from any graffiti, overgrown
vegetation, and left over residues from previous work/installations.
      (5)   Damaged or worn property elements shall be repaired, restored or
replaced and secured properly to remain operable.
      (6)   Vacant structures shall be securely closed and weathertight. Any

   (D)   The Historic Preservation Officer shall present to the Historic
Landmark Commission a list of properties recommended for approval or denial of
the tax exemption based on the findings of the inspection survey. A denial
recommendation may include the following reasons:

with the City’s applicable regulations and historic design guidelines or is not
in compliance with the City’s Zoning Ordinance; or
      (2)   Deficiencies from previous inspection surveys were not completed by

      (3)   Exterior work was completed, installed, or is under construction
without a certificate of approval or in deviation of a previously approved

   (E)   The Historic Landmark Commission shall hold a public hearing to make a
determination of property eligibility and to certify properties have adequately
addressed the deficiencies in the required time frame from the previous year
and are in compliance. The Historic Landmark Commission may grant an extension
to properties if it is determined that extenuating circumstances exist. Such
circumstances should generally be justified by supportive information such as:
      (1)   Cost estimates or other information indicating the required repair
is more substantial than initially expected;
      (2)   Documentation that the issue(s) was misidentified or didn't exist
in the manner described in the tax exemption survey; or
      (3)   Documentation that the issue is being addressed as part of a larger
series of repairs or improvements and has received approval with a Certificate
of Approval.

Council not later than March 1 of the subject year, along with the Historic
Landmark Commission's determination for approval or denial of applications for

exemption survey. The applicant shall address deficiencies within the time
frame determined at the time of notification.

included in the list forwarded to the chief appraiser with the adopting
ordinance and the property owner may resubmit for tax exemption consideration
the following year in accordance with §
38.32 of this subchapter.
(Ord. OR-2146-19, passed 9-9-19)
§ 38.35 ADOPTION OF ORDINANCE BY CITY COUNCIL.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 EXTENSION OF WATER AND SEWER LINES BY PRIVATE DEVELOPER.
   (A)   When a developer shall have been required to provide and shall have
provided necessary offsite water and sanitary sewer lines and shall have
provided a statement to the city certifying the cost of construction of the
improvements and such statement is considered acceptable documentation for
construction costs associated with the improvements, and such improvements will
also benefit other property owners requiring use of the improvements, and such
cost is deemed by the city to be fair and just, property owners benefitting
from the improvements and desiring to connect onto the water or sanitary sewer
line shall share in the cost of such improvements by making repayment to the
city on a "pro rata basis" in the amount determined by the City Engineer for
the costs associated with the construction of the improvements.
   (B)   DEVELOPER, as used herein, shall mean any person seeking extension of
water and/or sanitary sewer service for two or more platted lots in an area in
which water and sewer mains have not been extended. An individual user shall
mean any person who is not a developer as defined herein. The City Engineer
shall determine water pro rata charges on the basis of a front footage formula
or on the length of the water line crossing the individual user's property, lot
or tract. As used in this section, front footage shall mean the width of the
property facing on a public street where the water extension is constructed
along and abutting the individual user's property, lot or tract. A per acre
basis pro rata may be used by the City Engineer to determine the amount of pro
rata charge to be made for sanitary sewer service.
   (C)   In the event a developer is required to construct offsite water and/or
sanitary sewer lines, the city is authorized to enter into a pro rata agreement
with the developer to collect pro rata charges as determined hereby from
property owners making future requests of connections onto the offsite water or
sanitary sewer lines, and to refund to the developer such collected pro rata
charges for any period of time up to ten years from the acceptance of the line
and up to 100% of the cost of the offsite improvements constructed by the
developer.
   (D)   It shall be the duty of a developer to procure, provide and pay for
the necessary easements and rights-of-way along the lines for water and sewer
extensions approved by the city, except to the extent public easements and
rights-of-way are already available for such extensions. All easements, rights-
of-way, lines, mains, valves, hydrants, laterals and appurtenances shall upon
installation and construction become the property of the city, free and clear
of all liens, claims and encumbrances. The pro rata charges set out herein
shall not include payment for any taps, valves, fittings or other appurtenances
necessary to be installed by a property owner connecting to the line after its
completion.

impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based
limitations above.
   (E)   Right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW.
   (F)   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (G)   Plant loading.
      (1)   No industry shall discharge wastewater containing a BOD or TSS
loading that causes the city's pro-rata share of the total BOD or TSS loading
to the POTW System to exceed the city's pro-rata share of the total flow to the
POTW System. (Example: If the city contributes 25% of the total wastewater flow
to the system, the city's cumulative BOD or TSS loading to the system, as
measured at the city's points of entry to the system, shall not exceed 25% of
the total BOD or TSS loading to the system.
      (2)   Any industry with a wastewater strength that will cause the city's
cumulative wastewater loading, at the city's points of entry, to exceed the
city's pro-rata share of the total wastewater loading based upon flow, shall be
required to install pretreatment facilities to reduce its wastewater strength
to an acceptable level.

§ 51.012 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in §
51.011(A) within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, the Control
Authority, or the Pretreatment Coordinator, whichever is more stringent. Any
facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained
at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator for review, and
shall be acceptable to the Pretreatment Coordinator before such facilities are
constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of
this subchapter.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Pretreatment Coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and require such other conditions as may be necessary to protect
the POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter.
      (2)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense,
a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Pretreatment Coordinator, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Pretreatment
Coordinator and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter,
or other control device as deemed necessary by the Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (C)   Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two
years, the Pretreatment Coordinator shall evaluate whether each permitted SIU
needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Pretreatment Coordinator
may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a
plan. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum,
the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Pretreatment Coordinator
and Control Authority of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
51.015(F); and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (D)   Hauled wastewater.
      (1)   Septage waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the Pretreatment Coordinator and Control Authority, and at such
times as are established by the Pretreatment Coordinator and Control Authority.
Such waste shall not violate § 51.011 or any other requirements established by
the city. The Pretreatment Coordinator and/or Control Authority may require
septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
      (2)   Septage waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every
load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste
hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of
waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the
type of generator, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any
wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
   (E)   Best Management Practices. The Pretreatment Coordinator may develop
BMPs and require users to implement such BMPs if necessary to protect the POTW.
Such BMPs would be supplemental and not used as a replacement for compliance
with local limits listed in §
51.011(D) and prohibited discharge standards in §
51.011(A) and (B).

2404-25, passed 1-13-25)
§ 51.013 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (A)   Wastewater analysis. When requested by the Pretreatment Coordinator, a
user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its
wastewater by the deadline stipulated. The Pretreatment Coordinator is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require
users to update this information.
   (B)   Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
      (1)   No SIU or NSCIU user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW
without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the Pretreatment
Coordinator, except that an SIU or an NSCIU that has filed a timely application
pursuant to §
51.013(C) may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein.
      (2)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require other users to obtain
wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of these
regulations. To determine the status of a user in relation to these
regulations, users may be required to perform sampling as specified by the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
      (3)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this subchapter and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§
51.018 through
51.020. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of
its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or
requirements with any other requirements of federal, state and local law.
   (C)   Wastewater discharge permitting: existing connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater
into the POTW prior to the effective date of this subchapter and who wishes to
continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 90, apply to the
Pretreatment Coordinator for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with §
51.013(E), and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue
after 90 days of the effective date of this subchapter except in accordance
with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the Pretreatment Coordinator. If,
in the Pretreatment Coordinator's judgment, the passing of this subchapter does
not significantly affect the IUs current permit, then the existing permit will
continue through to the expiration date.
   (D)   Wastewater discharge permitting: new connections. Any user required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit that proposes to begin or recommence
discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or
recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge
permit, in accordance with §
51.013(E), must be filed prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin
or recommence.
   (E)   Wastewater discharge permit application contents. All users required
to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit application. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may require all users to submit as part of an
application the following information:
      (1)   All information required by §
51.015(A)(2);
      (2)   Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on the
premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or stored at
the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be, discharged
to the POTW;
      (3)   Number and type of employees, hours of operation, and proposed or
actual hours of operation;
      (4)   Each product produced by type, amount, process or processes, and
rate of production;
      (5)   Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum per
day);
      (6)   Site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and details
to show all sewers, floor drains, and appurtenances by size, location, and
elevation, and all points of discharge;
      (7)   Time and duration of discharges; and
      (8)   Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the
Pretreatment Coordinator to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit
application. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and
will be returned to the user for revision.
   (F)   Application signatories and certification.
      (1)   All wastewater discharge permit applications and user reports must
be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the following
certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and civil
penalties for knowing violations."
      (2)   If the designation of an authorized representative of the user is
no longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new written
authorization satisfying the requirements of this subsection must be submitted
to the Pretreatment Coordinator prior to or together with any reports to be
signed by an authorized representative of the user.
      (3)   A facility determined to be a NSCIC by the Pretreatment Coordinator
must annually submit the signed certification statement signed by an authorized
representative. This certification must accompany an alternative report
required by the Pretreatment Coordinator:

§ 51.015 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Baseline monitoring reports.
      (1)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
POTW shall submit to the Pretreatment Coordinator a report which contains the
information listed in section (2), below. At least 90 days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that will become
categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard, shall submit to the Pretreatment Coordinator a report which contains
the information listed in section (2), below. A new source shall report the
method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical
standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and
quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
      (2)   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
         (a)   Identifying information. The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.
         (b)   Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control
permits held by or for the facility.
         (c)   Description of operations. A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications and/or
NAICS of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should
include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the
POTW from the regulated processes.
         (d)   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured or estimated
average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from
regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the
combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(E).
         (e)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process (and any new categorically regulated process for existing
sources).
            2.   The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature
and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the
Pretreatment Coordinator, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average
concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in §
51.015(J). Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution
prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the
Pretreatment Coordinator or the applicable standards to determine compliance
with the standard.
            3.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in §
51.015(K).
            4.   If discharge flow conditions are representative of daily
operations, the user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
The Pretreatment Coordinator may require additional representative sampling to
be conducted.
            5.   Representative samples should be taken immediately downstream
from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula in 40 CFR § 304.6(e) to evaluate compliance with Pretreatment
Standards.
            6.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
            7.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and method of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycle and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (f)   Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized
representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established
for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to
this section must meet the requirements set out in §
51.015 (B).
         (h)   Signature and certification. All baseline-monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with §
51.013(F).
   (B)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by §
51.015 (A)(2)(g).
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Pretreatment
Coordinator no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (C)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Pretreatment Coordinator a report containing the information described in §
51.015(A)(2)(d) through (f). For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-
term production rate. In cases where the categorical pretreatment standard
requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user
shall submit documentation as required by the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure
of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during
the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with §
51.013(F).
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   All SIUs shall, at a frequency determined by the Pretreatment
Coordinator but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report indicating
the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited
by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the categorical
pretreatment standard or the Pretreatment Coordinator requires compliance with
a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation
as required by the Pretreatment Coordinator or the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
§
51.013(F).
      (2)   All NSCIUs shall submit a report annually in the month specified by
the Pretreatment Coordinator. The report shall be completed according to the
city’s current reporting requirements, including the submittal of the
applicable certification statement found in §
51.013(F)(3).
      (3)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (4)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Pretreatment
Coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in §
51.015(J) and (K), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
   (E)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator of any planned significant changes to the users operations or
system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater a
minimum of 30 days prior to the change.
      (1)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
51.013(E).
      (2)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under §
51.013(G) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
51.014(E) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      (3)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants that are determined to be of concern.
   (F)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city and the
control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location
of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, unless waived by the
Director, the user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause
(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this subchapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   SIUs are required to notify the Pretreatment Coordinator
immediately of any changes at their facilities affecting the potential for a
slug discharge.
   (G)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Pretreatment Coordinator as the Pretreatment Coordinator may require.
   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Pretreatment Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Coordinator within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the
Pretreatment Coordinator monitors at the user's facility at least once a month,
or if the Pretreatment Coordinator samples between the user's initial sampling
and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this section need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under § 51.015(E). The notification requirement in this
section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §
51.015(A), (C) and (D).
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1),
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR § 261.30(d) and § 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR § 261.30(d) and § 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator, the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this subchapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (J)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, as amended, unless otherwise specified in an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or
where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques
are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any applicable sampling and
analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Pretreatment
Coordinator, the EPA, TCEQ, or other parties approved by EPA.
   (K)   Sample collection.
      (1)   Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3), below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Pretreatment Coordinator/or Control Authority may authorize the use of time
proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Pretreatment Coordinator,
as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be used to show compliance with
instantaneous discharge limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day
compliance reports required in §
51.015(A) and (C) [40 CFR § 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and
volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data
does not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Pretreatment Coordinator may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by §
51.015(D) [40 CFR §§ 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the IU is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (L)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a
mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt
of the report shall govern.
   (M)   Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
subchapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this subchapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant
to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs established in these
regulations. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the date's analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the Pretreatment Coordinator, or where the Pretreatment Coordinator and/or
Control Authority have specifically notified the user of a longer retention
period.

§ 51.016 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Right of entry: inspection and sampling. The Pretreatment Coordinator
and/or the Control Authority, TCEQ, or USEPA or their designated representative
shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the
user is complying with all requirements of this subchapter and any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow inspecting or
sampling person ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force, which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the city, Control Authority, TCEQ or USEPA will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
      (2)   The Pretreatment Coordinator and/or Control Authority shall have
the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the users
operations. All sampling and analysis performed by the Pretreatment Coordinator
and/or Control Authority to monitor compliance shall be at the expense of the
IU.
      (3)   The Pretreatment Coordinator and/or Control Authority may require
the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated, at a minimum, annually to
ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Pretreatment Coordinator and/or
Control Authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the inspecting or sampling person
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this subchapter.
      (6)   In accordance with 40 CFR Part 403, the city shall inspect and
monitor each permitted SIU a minimum of once per year. If the city elects to
perform compliance monitoring for the SIU then the city will monitor the
industry a minimum of semiannually.
      (7)   The city shall inspect each NSCIU a minimum of once per year. If
the Pretreatment Coordinator elects to perform compliance monitoring for the
NSCIU then the city will monitor the industry a minimum of one time each permit
cycle.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Pretreatment Coordinator and/or Control
Authority has been refused or denied access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the Pretreatment Coordinator designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Pretreatment
Coordinator and/or Control Authority may seek issuance of a search warrant or
an administrative search warrant from an appropriate court or judicial officer.

§ 51.017 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to
the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city and/or Control Authority,
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall only be
made available for inspection by the public pursuant to the Texas Public
Information Act, but shall be made available immediately upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES or TPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR § 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.

§ 51.018 PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of
general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the
jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users, which at any time during
the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance
shall be applicable to all SIUs (or other IUs that violate subsections (C),
(D), or (H) of this section) and shall mean:
   (A)   CHRONIC VIOLATIONS OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGE LIMITS, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
   (B)   TECHNICAL REVIEW CRITERIA (TRC) VIOLATIONS, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (C)   Any other discharge violation that the Pretreatment Coordinator
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference, or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public;
   (D)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Pretreatment
Coordinator or Control Authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt
or prevent such a discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (H)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation do BMPs, which
the Pretreatment Coordinator determines will adversely affect the operation or
implementation of the local pretreatment program.

2404-25, passed 1-13-25)
§ 51.019 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds
that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within the time frame
specified in the notice, which is usually, but not always, an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user
to the Pretreatment Coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Pretreatment Coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Reserved.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Pretreatment Coordinator may order a user
which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter,
a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Pretreatment
Coordinator and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (F)   Reserved.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Pretreatment Coordinator may also immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension the Pretreatment
Coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
51.019(H) are initiated against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Pretreatment Coordinator prior
to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under §
51.019(C) or (H).
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in §
51.014(F) of this subchapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
51.011.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
51.019(C) why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option
by the Pretreatment Coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (I)   Recovery of costs incurred by the city. Any user violating any of the
provisions of this subchapter, the regulations, or rules of the control
authority, orders issued by the Pretreatment Coordinator, or orders of any
court of competent jurisdiction, or who discharges or causes a discharge
producing a deposit, obstruction, deterioration in effluent quality, or causes
damage to or impairs the POTW(s) shall be liable for any expense, loss, or
damage caused by such violation or discharge. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
order the user to clean up, repair, replace, and pay for any expenses, loss, or
damages caused by the act of commission or omission by the user and bill the
user for the costs incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair, or
replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the
assessed cost shall constitute a violation of this subchapter enforceable under
the provisions of this chapter, including the penalty provisions. In addition,
after notice to the user and failure of the user to pay or to perform as
required by the Pretreatment Coordinator, the Pretreatment Coordinator may file
suit in the appropriate court with jurisdiction in the amount of cost paid or
incurred by the city and collect the amount as an itemized sworn account. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may file such cost as a lien against the property.
   (J)   Any violation of the prohibitions or limits of this subchapter,
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder is hereby declared a
public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
Pretreatment Coordinator. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to all city ordinances governing nuisances, including reimbursing the
city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
The city may file such cost as a lien against the property.

§ 51.020 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may petition
the appropriate court through the city’s attorney, or designated
representative, for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and temporary
or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this subchapter on activities of the user. The
Pretreatment Coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for
a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   A user who violates any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable
by a fine of not more than $2,000 per violation, per day.
      (2)   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to the same penalties
described in §
51.020(C)(1). This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action
for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
      (3)   A user who makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, subchapter, wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate
any monitoring device or method required under this subchapter shall, upon
conviction, be subject to the same penalties described in §
51.020(C)(1).
      (4)   Criminal responsibility. A culpable mental state is not required to
prove an offense under this subchapter.
         (a)   A person is criminally responsible for a violation of this
subchapter if:
            1.   The person commits or assists in the commission of a
violation, or causes or permits another person to commit a violation; or
            2.   The person owns or manages the property or facilities
determined to be the cause of the illegal discharge under §§
51.011(A), (B), or (D);
51.012(D) or
51.013(B).
         (b)   If conduct constituting an offense is performed by an “agent”
acting on behalf of a corporation, partnership, or association and within the
scope of his or her office or employment, the corporation, association, or
partnership is criminally responsible for the offense. An “agent” means a
director, officer, employee, or other person authorized to act on behalf of a
corporation, association, or partnership.
   (D)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this subchapter
are not exclusive. The Pretreatment Coordinator may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city
enforcement response plan. However, the Pretreatment Coordinator may take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
Pretreatment Coordinator is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against any noncompliant user.
   (E)   Applicability of more stringent regulations.
      (1)   If national pretreatment standards, categorical or otherwise, more
stringent than the discharge limits prescribed in this article are promulgated
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for certain industries,
the more stringent national pretreatment standards will apply to the affected
IU. A violation of the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also
be considered a violation of this subchapter.
      (2)   Applicability of more stringent discharge limits. An IU within the
city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another
governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a reciprocal
agreement with the city is subject to the following additional rules:
         (a)   If the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits
than those prescribed by this subchapter, or by a discharge permit issued
hereunder, because the United States Environmental Protection Agency requires
the more stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entity's
wastewater pretreatment program, the more stringent discharge limits shall
prevail.
         (b)   The Pretreatment Coordinator is authorized to issue a discharge
permit to an IU affected by subsection (a) above, to insure notice of and
compliance with the more stringent discharge limits. If the IU already has a
discharge permit, the Pretreatment Coordinator may amend the permit to apply
and enforce the more stringent discharge limits. An IU shall submit to the
Pretreatment Coordinator an expected compliance date and an installation
schedule if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or
mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes.
         (c)   If the Pretreatment Coordinator chooses not to issue or amend a
permit under subsection (b) above, the Pretreatment Coordinator shall notify
the affected IU in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their
effective date. Regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended, an
IU shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent
discharge limits.
         (d)   The more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon
termination of the city's wholesale wastewater contract or reciprocal agreement
with the governmental entity, or upon modification or elimination of the limits
by the government entity or the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
The Pretreatment Coordinator shall take the appropriate action to notify the
affected IU of an occurrence under this subsection.
      (3)   Variances in compliance dates. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry when, in the Pretreatment
Coordinator's opinion, such action is necessary to achieve pretreatment or
corrective measures. In no case shall the Pretreatment Coordinator grant a
variance in compliance dates to an industry affected by national categorical
pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates established by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency.
      (4)   Authority to regulate. The Pretreatment Coordinator may establish
regulations, not in conflict with this subchapter other laws, to control the
disposal and discharge of industrial waste into the wastewater system and to
insure compliance with the city's pretreatment enforcement program with all
applicable pretreatment regulations promulgated by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency. The regulations established shall, where
applicable, be made part of any discharge permit issued to an IU by the
Pretreatment Coordinator.

§ 51.022 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   In an action brought in federal court only: upset provision.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section UPSET, means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An UPSET does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (3), below, are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Pretreatment Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five days:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (B)   In an action brought in municipal or state court only: act of God
provision.
      (1)   An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely
by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe is not a violation.
      (2)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have
the burden of proof.
      (3)   In the event that subsections (B)(1) and (2) above have been
demonstrated the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section:
         (a)   BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
         (b)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities, which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources, which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections (C)(3) and (4) of this section.
      (3)   (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Pretreatment Coordinator, at least ten days before
the date of the bypass, if possible.
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Pretreatment Coordinator
of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Pretreatment Coordinator may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
      (4)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Pretreatment Coordinator may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C)(3)
of this section.
         (b)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Pretreatment Coordinator
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (C)(4)
(a)1. of this section.

§ 51.024 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Pretreatment charges and fees.
      (1)   The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of
setting up and operating the City of Mansfield's Pretreatment Program, which
may include:
         (a)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the
cost of processing such applications;
         (b)   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
         (c)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;
         (d)   Fees for filing appeals;
         (e)   Recovery of administrative and legal costs associated with
enforcement activity taken by the city to address IUs noncompliance.
         (f)   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered
by this subchapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties
chargeable the city;
         (g)   Fees for treating abnormal strength wastes; and
         (h)   Fees incurred from an upset, bypass or unauthorized discharge.
      (2)   Surcharge.
         (a)   The city may surcharge IUs for the treating of abnormal strength
wastes. Water or wastes having: (1) a five day biochemical oxygen demand
greater than 250 parts per million (ppm) by weight; or (2) containing more than
250 parts per million by weight of total suspended solids shall be subject to
the review and approval of the Pretreatment Coordinator. Where the Pretreatment
Coordinator has approved the admission of §
51.024(A)(2)(a)1. and 2. above into the POTW, that discharge may be subject to
a surcharge as determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator. In no case shall a
discharge be accepted that will prevent the POTW from meeting its limits.
         (b)   The surcharge will be assessed according to the following
formula each month using the most current pollutant concentration data and the
current month’s wastewater flow:
Surcharge =    Q , x [a(BOD - x) + b(TSS - y)][8.34]
      1,000,000
Where:
   Q       =   flow in gallons
   8.34       =   weight in pounds of one gallon water
   x       =   normal limits of BOD in domestic wastewater expressed in
milligrams per liter
   y       =   normal limits of TSS in domestic wastewater expressed in
milligrams per liter
   a      =   unit cost of treatment per pound of BOD
   b      =   unit cost of treatment per pound of TSS
   BOD      =   measured amount of BOD, in mg/l
   TSS      =   measured amount of TSS, in mg/l
         (c)   A surcharge is an additional charge by the POTW for the
increased cost of handling discharge of unusual strength and character and
shall not serve as a variance to the requirements of this subchapter. Exercise

STORMWATER DISCHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY
§ 52.35 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter applies to all sites located within the city that have
stormwater discharges associated with regulated construction activity by TPDES
or NPDES permit requirements, and/or other construction activities determined
by the city to pose a hazard to the quality of water flowing through the MS4.
This includes the construction of an entry/exit location, drill pad site, and
other construction activities as required for exploration and/or extraction of
natural gas, other petroleum products, or any other minerals within city
limits.
(Ord. 1680, passed 3-10-08)
§ 52.36 ACCESS TO FACILITIES.
   (A)   The Director, or an authorized representative, is authorized by §
52.51 of this chapter to enter and inspect construction sites subject to
regulation under this subchapter.
   (B)   Site owners and/or operators shall allow the Director of Public Works,
or an authorized representative, ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that
must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES or TPDES permit to discharge
stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state
and federal law.
   (C)   The Director, or authorized representative, shall have the right to
set up on any permitted construction site such devices as are necessary in the
opinion of the Director to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
construction site's stormwater discharge.
   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
site to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator
at the written or oral request of the Director, or authorized representative,
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
   (E)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director, or authorized
representative, access to a permitted construction site are a violation of a
stormwater discharge permit and of this subchapter. A person who is the owner
and/or operator of a construction site with an NPDES or TPDES permit, or site
qualified to be covered by an NPDES or TPDES permit, to discharge stormwater
associated with construction activity commits an offense if the person denies
the Director reasonable access to the permitted construction site for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
   (F)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and the Director is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter or any
state or federal discharge permit, limitation, or requirement, or that there is
a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 1680, passed 3-10-08)
§ 52.37 NON-PERMITTED DISCHARGES PROHIBITED.
   A person who is the owner and/or operator of a construction site commits an
offense if the person discharges, or causes to be discharged, stormwater
associated with construction activity without first having obtained a NPDES or
TPDES permit to do so, unless a permit is not required by a state or federal
requirement.
(Ord. 1680, passed 3-10-08)
Penalty, see § 52.99
§ 52.38 SUBMISSION OF NOTICE OF INTENT, CONSTRUCTION SITE NOTICE, AND NOTICE OF
TERMINATION TO THE CITY.
   (A)   The owner and/or operator of a large construction site, greater than
five acres or part of a common plan of development greater than five acres,
required to have an NPDES or TPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated
with construction activity shall submit a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) to
the city at least 48 hours prior to construction activity commencing. The owner
and/or operator of a small construction site, greater than one acre but less
than five acres and not part of a larger common plan of development greater
than five acres, shall submit a copy of the construction site notice to the
city a minimum of 48 hours before construction activities begin.
   (B)   These documents may be delivered to the Public Works Director either
in person or by mailing to:
Public Works, Stormwater
City of Mansfield
1200 E. Broad St
Mansfield, TX 76063
Or email:

§ 52.39 DAMAGE TO STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   It is a violation of this chapter for any person to damage, or allow to be
damaged, any temporary or permanent stormwater control measures, through his or
her actions or inaction without promptly restoring the control measure to an
effective and efficient state.
(Ord. 1680, passed 3-10-08)
Penalty, see § 52.99
§ 52.40 DISCHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.
   (A)   All operators of construction sites shall use the methodology on best
management practices from the most current North Central Texas Council of
Government best management practices for construction activities manual, or
similar approved and accepted best management practices, to control and reduce
the discharge to the MS4 of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other material
associated with the clearing, grading, excavation, and other construction
activities to the maximum extent practicable. Such best management practices
may include, but not be limited to, the following measures:
      (1)   To the extent possible and where feasible preserve existing
vegetation. Stabilization measures for all disturbed areas associated with the
construction project, regardless of physical location within or without the
site, shall be implemented in compliance with the Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan prepared for the construction site and in accordance with any
additional requirements contained within the effective Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality Construction General Permit TXR 150000;
      (2)   Use of appropriate erosion and sediment control measures installed
according to standard or product approved details and properly maintained and
repaired to ensure effective performance at reducing sedimentation offsite;
      (3)   Use of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils,
store flows, or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from the
site to the extent feasible;
      (4)   Minimization of the tracking of sediments off-site by vehicles, the
generation of dust, and the escape of other windblown waste from the site;
      (5)   Prevention of the discharge of building materials, including
cement, lime, concrete and stucco operations, mortar, sand, or similar
materials used in such activities, to the MS4;
      (6)   Providing general good housekeeping measures to prevent and contain
spills of paints, solvents, fuels, septic waste, and other hazardous chemicals
and pollutants associated with construction, and to assure proper cleanup and
disposal of any such spills in compliance with state, federal, and local
requirements;
      (7)   Provide a location on site, or near site, for personal and
construction waste so as to prevent littering;
      (8)   Implementation of proper waste disposal and waste management
techniques, including covering waste materials, minimizing ground contact with
hazardous chemicals and trash, and keeping trash receptacles off of paved
surfaces, or other locations that drain directly to a storm drain system or
local waterway;
      (9)   Sanitary waste facilities shall be maintained so that they do not
create a hazard to the environment. Sanitary facilities should not be placed
over any paved surfaces;
      (10)   Discharges from dewatering activities, including discharges from
dewatering of trenches and excavations, must be treated to the extent
practicable and so that sediments are filtered or settled prior to ultimate
discharge from site or into an underground storm sewer system; and
      (11)   Installation of structural measures during the construction
process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after
construction operations have been completed. Structural measures should be
placed on upland soils to the degree attainable. Such installed structural
measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: stormwater
detention structures (including wet ponds); stormwater retention structures;
flow attenuation by use of open vegetative swales and natural depressions;
other velocity dissipation devices; infiltration of runoff on site; and
sequential systems which combine several practices. Operators of construction
sites are responsible for the installation and maintenance of stormwater
management measures prior to final stabilization of the site, and are not
responsible for maintenance after stormwater discharges associated with
construction activity have terminated.
   (B)   It is a violation of this chapter if a discharge occurs from a
construction site containing materials other than stormwater and such discharge
and/or materials are allowed to accumulate within the MS4 and such accumulation
persists for a period beyond three days unless greater time is allowed by the
Director of Public Works for removal. This includes discharges of sediment, to
include off-site tracking be vehicles entering and exiting the site, paints,
solvents, cleaners, wind blown debris, or other materials associated with the
construction activity at the site.

§ 52.41 STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLANS.
   (A)   The city may require any plans and specifications that are prepared
for the construction of site improvements to illustrate and describe the best
management practices required within this section that will be implemented at
the construction site. The city may deny approval of any building permit,
grading permit, subdivision plat, site development plan, or any other city
approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume
occupancy, on the grounds that the management practices described in the plans
or observed upon a site inspection by the city are determined not to control
and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials
associated with clearing, grading, excavation, and other construction
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
   (B)   Qualified personnel (provided by the operator of the construction
site) shall inspect disturbed areas of any construction site that have not been
finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to
precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter
or exit the site, in accordance with the inspection schedule included in the
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for the site. All erosion and
sediment control measures and other identified best management practices shall
be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are
effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the MS4.
Based on the results of the inspection, best management practices shall be
maintained, repaired, or revised as appropriate, and as soon as is practicable
and maintenance, repair or revision activities noted in the SWPPP for the site.
   (C)   The city may require changes be made to an owner and/or operator's
SWPPP if, in the best professional judgment of the Director, or authorized
representative, the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the owner
and/or operator's NPDES or TPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with
construction activities.
   (D)   The deficiencies in an owner and/or operator's SWPPP will be provided
in writing, and the Director, or an authorized representative, will give the
owner and/or operator a reasonable amount time, not to exceed 14 days, to make
the necessary changes in the SWPPP.

§ 52.53 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. When the Director of Public Works, or an
authorized representative, finds that any person has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the city
may serve upon that person a written notice of violation. Within ten days of
the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention of reoccurrence thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the alleged violator to the
city. If the alleged violator denies that any violation occurred or contends
that no corrective action is necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such
denial or contention shall be submitted to the city within ten days of receipt
of the notice. Submission of an explanation or plan in no way relieves the
alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the city to take any action, including emergency action or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Director of Public Works, or an authorized representative,
finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past
violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) have caused
or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4, waters of the
state, or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to
the environment, the Director of Public Works, or an authorized representative,
may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the violator to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all subchapter requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this
section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the Director of Public Works, or an
authorized representative, may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize harm to the MS4, waters of the State of Texas, or waters of the
United States, or endangerment to persons or to the environment; including
immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other
municipal utility services. The city may allow the person to recommence its
discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of
Public Works, or an authorized representative, that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the
discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city within five
days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the violator.
   (C)   Stop work orders.
      (1)   Whenever the Director of Public Works, or an authorized
representative, finds that any operator of a facility, to include a
construction site, has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, or any permit or order issued thereunder, the Director, or an
authorized representative, may order that a stop work order be issued to the
operator, posted at the facility, and distributed to all city departments and
divisions whose decisions affect any activity at the site.
      (2)   Unless express written exception is at issuance, the stop work
order shall prohibit any further construction activity at the entire site and
shall bar any further inspection or approval by the city associated with a
building permit, grading permit, subdivision plat approval, site development
plan approval, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue
construction or to assume occupancy at the site.
      (3)   A person receiving an order under this section may file a written
notice of appeal with the Director of Public Works, no later than the tenth day
after receipt of the order. Such notice shall include an explanation as to why
the person believes the enforcement action should not be taken.
      (4)   Issuance of a stop work order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
   (D)   Nuisance abatement.
      (1)   Unless specifically stated otherwise, any nuisance as defined
within this chapter is hereby declared a nuisance if it exists within the
corporate limits of the city or within 5,000 feet of such limits. The Director
of Public Works, or an authorized representative, may give notice to cease,
abate, remove or otherwise remedy a nuisance immediately to:

does not relieve the violator of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation.
   (F)   If the owner/person does not comply with the notice within ten days of
service, the Director may enter any public or private property containing the
nuisance and do any work necessary to abate the nuisance, except the demolition
of buildings.
   (G)   If the immediate abatement of the nuisance is deemed necessary by a
Director to protect the environment or the public health, safety, or welfare
from an imminent and substantial endangerment, such Director may, without
complying with the notice provisions of this section or without waiting the
ten-day period, enter the subject property and do or cause to be done any work
necessary to abate the nuisance and remediate and restore the environment.
   (H)   After abating the nuisance, the Director may inform the owner/person
in a notice sent certified mail, return receipt requested, that if the owner/
person commits another violation of the same kind or nature that poses a danger
to the environment or to the public health and safety on or before the first
anniversary date of the original notice, the city may without further notice
correct the violation at the owner's expense and assess the expense against the
owner's property.
   (I)   All costs incurred by the city to abate a nuisance and remediate and
restore the environment, including the cost of giving notice as required, shall
be initially paid by the city and charged to the owner of the property.
   (J)   To obtain a lien against the property, the Director causing the
abatement shall file a statement of expenses with the County Clerk for the
county in which the property is located. The lien statement shall state the
name of the owner, if known, and the legal description of the property. The
lien shall be security for the costs incurred and interest accruing at the rate
of 10% on the amount due from the date of payment by the city.
   (K)   The lien is inferior only to:
      (1)   Tax liens; and
      (2)   Liens for street improvements.
   (L)   A lien may not be filed against real estate protected by the homestead
provisions of the Texas Constitution.

charges, when billed through utility bills, shall be identified separately on
such bills. Delinquent charges shall be collected in a manner consistent with §
552.050 of the Tex. Loc. Gov't Code. A user of a benefitted property is
responsible for payment of drainage charges. For users billed by the city for
other utility charges, such as water and/or sewer service, the city may bill
the user for drainage charges in the same bill. Otherwise, the city shall
establish a new drainage billing account and the bill shall be sent to the
address provided for the new account. Failure of a user to pay such charges may
result in the discontinuance of city drainage, water or sewer service.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 54.001 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Having a dependable water supply has always been a key issue in the
development of Texas. The growing population and economic expansion occurring
in North Central Texas are placing increased demands on our water supplies. In
order to meet the challenge of providing for our current and future needs we
must learn to use the water we already have more efficiently. By stretching our
existing supplies we can delay the need for new supplies, minimize the
environmental impacts associated with developing new water resources, and
postpone the high cost of building the infrastructure (dams, treatment
facilities, and pipelines) necessary to capture, treat, and transport the
additional water into our homes and businesses.
   (B)   Recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies, the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has developed guidelines and
requirements governing the development of water conservation plans for public
water suppliers. TCEQ guidelines and requirements are included in Appendix A.
The city has developed this water conservation plan in response to TCEQ
guidelines and requirements.
   (C)   The objectives of this water conservation plan are as follows:
      (1)   To reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail
without conservation efforts.
      (2)   To reduce the loss and waste of water.
      (3)   To improve efficiency in the use of water.
      (4)   To extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate
of growth in demand.
      (5)   To educate the citizens of Mansfield about the need for water
conservation and the benefits of conserving our most valued natural resource.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.002 TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY RULES.
   The TCEQ rules governing development of water conservation plans for public
water suppliers are contained in Tex. Admin. Code Title 30, Part 1, Chapter
288, Subchapter A, Rule 288.2, which is included in
Appendix B. For the purpose of these rules, a WATER CONSERVATION PLAN is
defined as “A strategy or combination of strategies for reducing the volume of
water withdrawn from a water supply source, for reducing the loss or waste of
water, for maintaining or improving the efficiency in the use of water, for
increasing the recycling and reuse of water, and for preventing the pollution
of water.” The elements in the TCEQ water conservation rules covered in this
conservation plan are listed below.

(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.003 WATER UTILITY PROFILE.
   
Appendix B to this water conservation plan is a modified water utility profile
based on the format recommended by the TCEQ. Some additional sections were
added in order to gather the information necessary to assess the effectiveness
of the water conservation plan.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.004 SPECIFICATION OF WATER CONSERVATION GOALS.
   Current TCEQ rules require the adoption of specific water conservation goals
for a water conservation plan. As part of plan adoption, each customer will
develop five-year and ten-year goals for per capita municipal use, following
TCEQ procedures described in the water utility profile (
Appendix B). The goals for this water conservation plan include the following:
   (A)   Maintain a per capita municipal water use below 150 gallons per capita
per day in 2029 (five-year goal) and 145 gallons per capita per day in 2034
(ten-year goal).
   (B)   Maintain the level of unaccounted water in the system below 10%
annually in 2024 and subsequent years, as discussed in §
54.023.
   (C)   Maintain a program of universal metering and meter replacement and
repair, as discussed in §
54.021.
   (D)   Decrease waste in lawn irrigation by enforcement of landscape water
management regulations, as discussed in §
54.073.
   (E)   Raise public awareness of water conservation and encourage responsible
public behavior through public communication and education programs, as
discussed in §
54.040.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
METERING, WATER USE RECORDS, CONTROL OF UNACCOUNTED WATER, AND LEAK DETECTION
AND REPAIR
§ 54.020 TRACKING OF WATER USAGE.
   One of the key elements in water conservation is careful tracking of water
use and control of losses through illegal diversions and leaks. Careful
metering of water deliveries and water use, detection and repair of leaks in
the distribution system, and regular monitoring of unaccounted water are
important in controlling losses.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.021 ACCURATE METERING OF RAW WATER DELIVERIES.
   The metering devices that measure raw water delivered to the city will be
maintained within a minimum of +/– 5% accuracy.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.022 METERING OF CUSTOMER AND PUBLIC USES AND METER TESTING, REPAIR, AND
REPLACEMENT.
   (A)   All connections to the water system are metered connections. All
meters will be maintained within an acceptable operating accuracy range as
defined by the manufacturer or the American Water Works Association (AWWA)
standard for meter accuracy, whichever is more stringent. Dead meters and
meters that indicate reduced usage will be flagged during the computerized
billing process. These meters will be checked, field tested, and replaced when
found to be out of manufacturer specifications or not meeting AWWA standards.
   (B)   All new meters installed as a new meter set or a meter replacement due
to age and inaccuracy will be installed with an Advanced Metering
Infrastructure (AMI) meter. The city will maintain a meter data management
system for all AMI meters.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.023 RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
   (A)   As required by Tex. Admin. Code Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 288,
Subchapter A, Rule 288.2(a)(2)(B), the record management system allows for the
separation of water sales and uses into residential, commercial, public/
institutional, and industrial categories. This information will be included in
an annual water conservation report, as described in §
54.026 below.
   (B)   The city will continue to maintain a record management system that
accounts for raw water received, drinking water treated, drinking water pumped,
water delivered, water sold, and water system loss. This record management
system will continue to separate and account for monthly usage in the following
customer categories: residential domestic, residential irrigation, commercial
usage, commercial/industrial irrigation, builders / construction,
institutional, and industrial.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.024 DETERMINATION AND CONTROL OF UNACCOUNTED WATER.
   (A)   Unaccounted water is the difference between raw water purchased from
the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) and metered deliveries to customers.
Authorized but unmetered uses would include use for fire fighting, releases for
flushing of lines, and uses associated with new construction. Unaccounted water
can include several categories:
      (1)   Inaccuracies in customer meters (customer meters tend to run more
slowly as they age and under-report actual use).
      (2)   Losses due to water main breaks and leaks in the water distribution
system.
      (3)   Losses due to illegal connections and theft.
      (4)   Other.
   (B)   The city will continue to monitor and minimize unaccounted water use
by periodic visual field inspection of all water facilities, use of fire
hydrant meters to quantify the volume of water lost during flushing, review of
property occupancy, and monthly comparisons of historical metered usage.
Additional measures will be taken at the water treatment plant to quantify
process water.
   (C)   Unaccounted water has varied from 7.48% to 9.89% in the last five
years. With the measures described in this plan, the city intends to maintain
the unaccounted water below 10% in 2024 and subsequent years.
(Ord. OR-2361-24, passed 4-22-24)
§ 54.025 LEAK DETECTION AND REPAIR.
   (A)   The city will continue to vigilantly monitor the water distribution
system and customer service connections for water leaks, and address the repair
of any leaks found in a manner that expeditiously stops water loss. All leaks
will be isolated and repaired as soon as possible.
   (B)   Meter readers watch for and report signs of illegal connections so
they can be addressed. Maintenance crews respond quickly to repair leaks
reported by the public and city personnel. Areas of the water distribution
system in which numerous leaks and line breaks occur are targeted for
replacement as funds are available.
   (C)   While it is impossible for the city staff alone to identify all leaks,
residents are provided an online water waste reporting tool through the city
website. All water waste reports are distributed via email to the Operations
Manager and Supervisor for prioritization and repair. Daily leak detection
reports are generated daily from the meter data management system, and staff
addresses potential leak concerns accordingly. Leak detection alerts are also
generated via the city’s online customer portal, and both residents and staff
are alerted to potential leak concerns.

APPENDIX C: LETTER TO REGION C WATER PLANNING GROUP
Letter to Region C Water Planning Group
Date
 
 
 
Mr. Kevin Ward
Chair, Region C Water Planning Group
Trinity River Authority
P.O. Box 60
Arlington, TX 76004
 
Dear Mr. Ward:
Enclosed please find a copy of the water conservation plan for customers of the
City of Mansfield. I am submitting a copy of this plan to the Region C Water
Planning Group in accordance with the Texas Water Development Board and Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality rules.
Sincerely,
 
 
Jeff Price
Executive Director, Public Works
City of Mansfield
1.   INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES
This plan addresses all of the current Texas Commission on Environmental
Equality (TCEQ) requirements for a drought contingency plan. The purpose of
this drought contingency plan is as follows:
•   To protect and preserve public health, welfare, and safety
•   To conserve the available water supply in times of drought and emergency
•   To maintain supplies for domestic water use, sanitation, and fire
protection
•   To minimize the adverse impacts of water supply shortages
•   To minimize the adverse impacts of emergency water supply conditions.
2.   TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY RULES
The TCEQ rules governing development of drought contingency plans for public
water suppliers and wholesale water suppliers are contained in Title 30, Part
1, Chapter 288, Subchapter B of the Texas Administrative Code. For the purpose
of these rules, a drought contingency plan is defined as “a strategy or
combination of strategies for temporary supply and demand management responses
to temporary and potentially recurring water supply shortages and other water
supply emergencies.”
3.   DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN
3.1   Provisions to Inform the Public and Opportunity for Public Input
The City of Mansfield will provide opportunity for public input in the
development of this drought contingency plan by the following means:
•   Having a public meeting at a time and place convenient to the public and
providing written notice to the public concerning the proposed plan and
meeting.
3.2   Provisions for Continuing Public Education and Information
The City of Mansfield will inform and educate the public about the drought
contingency plan by the following means:
•   Preparing a bulletin describing the plan and making it available at city
hall and other appropriate locations.
•   Making the plan available to the public through the city’s website.
•   Notifying local organizations, schools, and civic groups that staff are
available to make presentations on the drought contingency plan (usually in
conjunction with presentations on water conservation programs).
At any time that the drought contingency plan is activated or the drought stage
changes, the City of Mansfield will notify local media of the issues, the
drought response stage, and the specific actions required of the public. The
information will also be publicized on the city’s website. Newsletters and/or
notices on bill stuffers will also be used as appropriate.
3.3   Initiation and Termination of Drought and Emergency Response Stages
Initiation of a Drought and Emergency Response Stage
The City Manager or official designee may order the implementation of a drought
response stage or water emergency when one or more of the trigger conditions
for that stage is met. The following actions will be taken when a drought stage
is initiated:
•   The public will be notified through local media and the city’s website as
described in Section 3.2.
•   Wholesale customers and the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) will be
notified by telephone and with a follow-up letter or e-mail that provides
details of the reasons for initiation of the drought stage.
•   If any mandatory provisions of the drought contingency plan are activated,
the City of Mansfield will notify the Executive Director of TCEQ within five
business days.
The City Manager or official designee may decide not to order the
implementation of a drought response stage or water emergency even though one
or more of the trigger criteria for the stage are met. Factors which could
influence such a decision include, but are not limited to, the time of the
year, weather conditions, the anticipation of replenished water supplies, or
the anticipation that additional facilities will become available to meet
needs. The reason for this decision should be documented.
Termination of a Drought Stage
The City Manager or official designee may order the termination of a drought
response stage or water emergency when the conditions for termination are met
or at their discretion. The following actions will be taken when a drought
stage is terminated:
•   The public will be notified through local media and the city’s website as
described in Section 3.2.
•   Wholesale customers and TRWD will be notified by telephone and with a
follow-up letter or email.
•   If any mandatory provisions of the drought contingency plan that have been
activated are terminated, the City of Mansfield will notify the Executive
Director of the TCEQ within five business days.
The City Manager or official designee may decide not to order the termination
of a drought response stage or water emergency even though the conditions for
termination of the stage are met. Factors which could influence such a decision
include, but are not limited to, the time of the year, weather conditions, or
the anticipation of potential changed conditions that warrant the continuation
of the drought stage. The reason for this decision should be documented.
3.4 Drought and Emergency Response Stages
Stage 1, Water Watch
Triggering and Terminating Conditions
TRWD has initiated Stage 1, Water Watch, which may be initiated by one or more
of the following:
•   Total raw water supply in TRWD western and eastern division reservoirs
drops below 75% (25% depleted) of conservation storage.
•   Water demand for all or part of the TRWD delivery system exceeds delivery
capacity because delivery capacity is inadequate. Water demand has exceeded or
is expected to exceed 80% of maximum sustainable production of delivery
capacity for an extended period
•   Water demand is projected to approach the limit of TRWD’s permitted supply.
•   TRWD’s supply source becomes contaminated.
•   TRWD’s water supply system is unable to deliver water due to the failure or
damage of major water system components.
•   The TRWD General Manager, with the concurrence of the TRWD Board of
Directors, finds that conditions warrant the declaration of a Stage 1 drought.
•   The City of Mansfield’s demand exceeds the amount that can be delivered to
customers.
•   City’s water demand for all or part of the delivery system approaches
delivery capacity because delivery capacity is inadequate.
•   City’s water treatment or distribution system becomes contaminated.
•   City’s water supply system is unable to deliver water due to the failure or
damage of major water system components.
•   City’s plan may be implemented if other criteria dictate.
Stage 1 may terminate when TRWD terminates its Stage 1 condition, when the
circumstances that caused the initiation of Stage 1 no longer prevail, or at
the discretion of the City Manager or official designee.
Stage 1 may be terminated when total raw water supply in TRWD western and
eastern division reservoirs reaches 85% for 90 days or lake levels reach 95%,
or at the discretion of the City Manager or official designee.
Goal for Use Reduction
The goal for water use reduction under Stage 1, Water Watch, is to decrease use
by five percent. If circumstances warrant or if required by TRWD, the City
Manager or his/her official designee can set a goal for greater water use
reduction.
Actions Available under Stage 1, Water Watch
The City Manager or official designee may implement any action(s) requested by
TRWD. In addition, the City Manager or official designee may order the
implementation of any of the other actions listed below, as deemed necessary.

more of the following:
•   Total raw water supply in TRWD western and eastern division reservoirs
drops below 45% (55% depleted) of conservation storage.
•   Water demand has exceeded or is expected to exceed 90% of the maximum
sustainable production of delivery capacity for an extended period.
•   Water demand is projected to approach or exceed the limit of TRWD’s
permitted supply.
•   TRWDs supply source becomes contaminated.
•   TRWD’s water supply system is unable to deliver water due to the failure or
damage of major water system components.
•   The TRWD General Manager, with the concurrence of the TRWD Board of
Directors, finds that conditions warrant the declaration of a Stage 3 drought.
•   The City of Mansfield’s demand exceeds production capacity of the amount
that can be delivered to customers for two consecutive days.

         (c)   Unclaimed notice. If notice is mailed in accordance with this
division (E), and the United States Postal Service returns the notice as
“refused” or “unclaimed” the validity of the notice is not affected, and the
notice is considered as delivered.
         (d)   Work to be performed. If the owner does not cause to be repaired
the violations of this section, the city may go on such property or authorize
another to go on such property, and do or cause the work to be done and charge
the expenses incurred to the owner of the property and assess the expenses
against the real estate on which the work was done. The remedy provided in this
section is in addition to any criminal penalties or other remedies authorized
by this chapter or other law.
         (e)   Contents of notice. The notice shall contain:
            1.   The name and address of the record owner;
            2.   An identification, which is not required to be a legal
description, of the property upon which the violation is located;
            3.   A statement describing the violation and the work necessary to

      (4)   Assessment of expenses; lien; appeal.
         (a)   Notice. In assessing the expenses incurred pursuant to this
division (E) against the property on which the work is done or improvements
made, the city shall send the owner of the property upon which the work was
done a notice which shall include:
            1.   Identification of the property;
            2.   A description of the violation;
            3.   A statement that the city abated the condition;
            4.   A statement of the city’s expenses in abating the condition;
            5.   An explanation of the property owner’s right to request a
hearing within ten days of the date of the letter; and
            6.   A statement that if the owner fails or refuses to pay the
expenses within 30 days of the date of the notice, the city shall place a lien
against the property by filing with the County Clerk of the county in which the
property is located a notice of lien and statement of expenses incurred.
         (b)   Method. The notice shall be sent in the same manner as provided
in division (E)(3)(b) above.
         (c)   Hearing. The City Manager or designee will conduct a hearing if
the property owner submits a written request within ten days of the date of the
notice. At the hearing:
            1.   The owner and the city may testify or present witnesses or
written information related to the city’s abatement of the nuisance.
            2.   The city has the burden to show that a violation of this
section existed, notice was given in substantial compliance with this section,
and expenses were incurred to abate the violation.
            3.   At the close of the hearing, the City Manager or designee may
find, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the expenses are valid,
or that they are erroneous or he or she may adjust them.
         (d)   Placement of lien. If no hearing is requested, or a hearing is
held and the expenses are determined to be valid or are otherwise appropriately
adjusted, and the owner fails or refuses to pay the expenses within 30 days
after written notification to pay, the city shall place a lien against the
property by filing with the County Clerk of the county in which the property is
located a notice of lien and statement of expenses incurred.
         (e)   Security. The lien is security for the expenses and interest
accruing at the rate of 10% per annum from the date the work was performed or
the expenses were incurred by the city.
         (f)   Filing. When the statement is filed, the city shall have a
privileged lien on that property, second only to tax liens and liens for street
improvements.
         (g)   Suit. The city may institute suit to recover the expenses, with
interest, and may foreclose on the property. The original or a certified copy
of the statement of expenses is prima facie proof of the expenses incurred by
the city in doing the work or making the improvements.
   (F)   In addition to any applicable fine, any vehicle in violation of this
section, whether on public or private property, may be removed and stored at
the expense of the owner or operator of the vehicle in accordance with the
provisions of Tex. Occ. Code Ch. 2308, as amended.

Control Department shall file a complaint against the adopting person in the
Mansfield Municipal Court.
         (b)   In a prosecution of a person for failing to sterilize an adopted
animal by the sterilization completion date, it shall be presumed that the
failure of such person to deliver to the Animal Care and Control Department a
letter required by division (G)(4) of this section is the result of the
person's refusal to have the adopted animal sterilized. The person may rebut
this presumption at trial with the proof required by division (G)(4) of this
section.
      (6)   Reclamation of animal. The Animal Care and Control Department may
reclaim an adopted animal after the expiration of the seventh day after the

continuing public nuisance shall remove such animal(s) from the city within 15
calendar days of such notification by the Animal Care and Control Department or

shall be an offense and each day thereafter that such person fails to remove
such animal(s) shall constitute a separate offense.
      (6)   If the owner or person in control of such animal(s) fails to remove
such animal(s) as provided for by the order of the Animal Care and Control
Department or the court, such animals may be impounded and put up for adoption

the city and the city shall become the owner.
      (7)   After the expiration of any required impoundment period or

and a half inches wide for any dog weighing less than 60 pounds. Dogs weighing
60 pounds or more shall not be tethered using a collar exceeding two inches in
width;

behind a fence of adequate size and strength capable of preventing the general
public, including children, and other animals from entering the area.
      (5)   A person commits an offense if the person tethers an animal to a
stationary object or a “skyline” aerial trolley during times of extreme
weather, including, but not limited to heat advisories, severe storm warnings

Officer, or any individual otherwise designated by the City Manager to be in
immediate harm may be removed from such situation by the quickest and most
reasonable means available.

tether or trolley system. This includes, but is not limited to, ambient outside
temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit or above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, severe
storms, winter weather events, or any other weather that would cause undue
stress on an outdoor domestic animal.
      (8)   If upon investigation, exigent circumstances exist and the Animal
Care and Control Officer, police officer, or any individual otherwise
designated by the City Manager, believe that there is imminent danger of
serious bodily injury or death to a human being, another animal, or the animal
in question, and there is insufficient time to obtain a warrant, the officer
can remove the animal(s) in question from the premises to receive care or for
safe keeping.
      (9)   A person commits an offense if the person who has been subject to
animal seizure for violations of humane care and treatment of animals, where a

receiving the sworn statements of any witnesses, the Animal Care and Control
Department determines that the animal is a dangerous dog, the Animal Care and

      (2)   In determining whether an animal is a dangerous dog under this
division, the Animal Care and Control Department shall consider all relevant
facts and circumstances and shall have the discretion to assign a
classification set forth in this section and impose requirements on the owner
in accordance with the classification or to not find an animal to be a
dangerous dog upon mitigating or extenuating circumstances.
      (3)   The following classifications shall be utilized by the Animal Care
and Control Department to determine the level of requirements on the owner:
         (a)   Level 1. The animal, while at-large, was determined to menace,
chase, or display threatening or aggressive behavior toward any domestic animal
or livestock.
         (b)   Level 2. The animal, while at-large, was determined to have
caused a bodily injury to any domestic animal or livestock.

or livestock; or
            2.   A dangerous dog classified as a Level 2 and is found to have
repeated the behavior in §

         (d)   Level 4. The animal was determined to:
            1.   Make an unprovoked attack on a person that caused bodily
injury and occurred in a place other than an enclosure in which the dog was
being kept and that was reasonably certain to prevent the dog from leaving the
enclosure on its own; or
            2.   Make an unprovoked attack in a place other than an enclosure
in which the dog was being kept and that was reasonably certain to prevent the
dog from leaving the enclosure on its own and that act caused a person to
reasonably believe that the dog will attack or cause bodily injury to a person.
      (4)   In addition to the behavior identified above, an animal may be
classified as a dangerous dog if the owner of the animal is found to be
criminally responsible for an animal under the owners control causing injury or
damage to another animal. The level of classification will be the level that
would have been assigned if the injury or damage had been caused while the
animal was at-large.
      (5)   The notice of determination shall include the following:
         (a)   That the animal was determined to be a dangerous dog;
         (b)   The level of requirements imposed on the owner pursuant to §

Control Department as a Level 1, 2 or 3 dangerous dog must remain impounded and
will not be released to the owner until the owner pays all fees incurred for
impoundment of the animal and complies with all requirements applicable to the
animal pursuant to §
90.59. If the owner of an impounded animal has not complied with §
90.59 within 30 days after a final determination is made that an impounded
animal is a dangerous dog, then the animal becomes the property of the city and

to be humanely destroyed.

the governmental unit or that is leased to or operated by an outside private

designate an unenclosed area within the facility as a permitted smoking
location. The area shall not be enclosed, not located within 30 feet of a
playground or seating area, not located within 30 feet of a door, operable
window/vent or other opening to an enclosed area and not a part of an athletic
field or dugout. The operator or manager of the facility may choose to prohibit

smoking area or to provide notice that smoking will not be permitted on the
entire premises.

regulatory authority shall post the letter grade card in the initial patron
contact area, or in a location determined at the discretion of the regulatory
authority.

authority, the grade card shall be removed from view and replaced with a sign,
provided by the regulatory authority, advising the public of the closure. The
sign must remain visible until such time the regulatory authority allows the
reopening to occur.

protection and replacement specified as follows.
   (A)   Residential developments. All areas within street right-of-ways,
utility or drainage easements as shown on an approved final plat and areas
designated as cut/fill on the master construction plan approved by the
Landscape Administrator shall be exempt from the tree protection and
replacement requirements specified herein. The developer may request the
Landscape Administrator to allow trees within potential building pad areas be
included in the exemption described herein. All other area shall be subject to
these requirements.
   (B)   Non-residential development. All area within street right-of-ways,
public utility or drainage easements as shown on an approved final plat, area
designated as cut/fill on the master construction plan approved by the
Landscape Administrator, plus fire lanes, parking areas and building pad as
shown on an approved construction plan shall be exempt from the tree protection
and replacement requirements specified herein.
   (C)   Gas well drilling and production facilities/natural gas pipelines.
Facilities constructed for gas well drilling and production, such as drill
sites, operation sites, compressor stations, frac ponds and access roads, and
natural gas pipelines and their related surface appertances, shall not be
exempt from the tree protection and replacement requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Permit requirements. A tree-removal permit shall not be required for
removal of a protected tree within an area noted in divisions (E)(1) and (E)(2)
below, however a permit must be obtained prior to the removal of any other
protected tree on the property.
   (E)   Landscape Administrator review.
      (1)   Residential development. A developer shall be required to furnish a
digital copy of the proposed development showing all proposed improvements
(e.g. right-of-ways, easements, lot patterns, cut/fill, etc.) with the
submittal of a site plan, development plan, preliminary plat, or final plat,
whichever occurs first. The digital copy shall use the North American Datum
1983 (NAD 83), Texas State Plane - North Central Zone (4202), United States,
and providing a scale factor if a surface survey is used. The Landscape
Administrator is authorized to require a tree survey meeting the requirements
of Appendix D herein when determined to be needed to fully evaluate the impact
on trees.
      (2)   Non-residential development. A developer shall be required to
furnish a digital copy of the proposed development showing all proposed
improvements (e.g. right-of-ways, easements, lot patterns, cut/fill, fire
lanes, parking areas and building pads, etc.) with the submittal of a site
plan, development plan, construction plan, plot plan or building permit
application, whichever occurs first. The digital copy shall use the North
American Datum 1983 (NAD 83), Texas State Plane - North Central Zone (4202),
United States, and providing a scale factor if a surface survey is used. The
Landscape Administrator is authorized to require a tree survey meeting the
requirements of Appendix D herein when determined to be needed to fully
evaluate the impact on trees.
      (3)   It is highly recommended that the developer consult with the
Landscape Administrator and submit the required transparency or survey for
review as early as possible so as to minimize changes in preliminary or final
plats and to determine that there is adequate area for the proposed
improvements after tree protection and replacement have been taken into
consideration.
      (4)   The Landscape Administrator will evaluate the required
transparency, survey or plan to determine that the developer has made a best
good-faith effort at saving as many protected trees as possible. The
Administrator will forward review comments to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for consideration regarding denial or approval of the development.
If the review involves a document that normally does not require the approval
of the Planning & Zoning Commission, the Administrator will follow the
procedures in division (E)(1) herein.
   (F)   Parking area. When a non-residential development consists of extra
parking spaces beyond 110% of the minimum parking spaces required by the Zoning
Ordinance, the developer shall be required to replace a percentage of the trees
removed or make a payment into the Tree Restoration Fund. The replacement trees
shall be calculated by multiplying the total diameter of trees removed in all
parking spaces by the percentage of said extra parking spaces to the total
number of parking spaces (i.e. total diameter of trees removed x extra parking
spaces ÷ total parking spaces). The replacement trees shall be provided in
accordance with §
99.37.

Administrator shall be exempt from the tree protection and replacement
requirements specified herein. All other area of the lot shall be subject to
these requirements.
      (1)   Permit requirements. A tree removal permit shall not be required
for removal of a protected tree within an area noted above; however a permit
must be obtained prior to the removal of any other protected tree on the
property.
      (2)   Landscape Administrator review. A transparency showing all proposed
improvements shall be required with the submittal of a building permit
application. The transparency shall be on a sheet drawn to a scale as required
by the Landscape Administrator or on a computer disk in the format of a
commonly used Computer-Aided Design (CAD) program. The Landscape Administrator
is authorized to require a tree survey meeting the requirements of Appendix D
herein when determined to be needed to fully evaluate the impact on trees.
   (C)   Agricultural property. The owner of property being actively used for
agricultural purposes shall be permitted to remove up to seven protected trees
per calendar year without obtaining a permit. Protected trees removed in excess
of seven will require permits. It is not the intent of this chapter to prohibit
the clearing of land for legitimate, agricultural use. The property owner shall
request the Landscape Administrator to make an on-site inspection of the
property to be cleared and provide the Landscape Administrator the purpose and
reason for the clearing. If the Landscape Administrator determines the clearing
of land to be for a legitimate, agricultural reason, he/she will issue a tree
removal permit.

§ 99.36 EXCEPTIONS.
   A tree removal permit and tree protection and replacement requirements shall
not be required under any of the following circumstances. The burden of proof
as a qualified exemption is upon the remover of a tree. It is highly
recommended that qualification as an exemption be determined with the Landscape
Administrator prior to removal of any tree.
   (A)   Preexisting conditions. All construction activities for which final
construction plans and building permit applications have been submitted prior
to the effective date of this chapter shall be exempt.
   (B)   Diseased trees. The tree is diseased, damaged beyond the point of
recovery or in danger of falling as determined by the Landscape Administrator
prior to the removal of the tree. The removal of a diseased tree by the city or
an individual is required to reduce the chance of spreading the disease to
adjacent healthy trees.
   (C)   Public safety. The tree endangers the public health, welfare or safety
and immediate removal is required.
   (D)   Utility service interruption. The tree has disrupted a public utility
service due to a tornado, storm, flood or other act of God. Removal shall be
limited to the portion of the tree reasonably necessary to reestablish and
maintain reliable utility service.
   (E)   Landscape nursery. All licensed plant or tree nurseries shall be
exempt from the requirements of this chapter as they pertain to those trees
planted and growing on the premises of the licensee that are so planted and
growing for the sale or intended sale to the general public in the ordinary
course of the licensee's business.
(Ord. 1220, passed 7-27-98)
§ 99.37 TREE REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Tree replacement. In the event that it is necessary to remove a
protected tree as specified in §§99.33 through 99.35, the party (other than
franchise utility companies) removing the tree shall be required to replace the
protected trees being removed with quality trees approved by the Landscape
Administrator. A sufficient number of trees shall be planted to equal or exceed
the diameter (measured at four and one-half inches above ground level) of each
tree removed. This mitigative measure is not meant to supplant good site
planning. Tree replacement will be considered only after all design
alternatives which could save more existing trees have been evaluated and
reasonably rejected. Said replacement trees shall be a minimum of three-and-a-
half inch diameter (measured at one foot above ground) and seven feet in height
when planted.
   (B)   Replacement procedures. At the time of review, the agent responsible
for replacement, the time of replacement and the location of the new trees will
be determined by the Landscape Administrator. The replacement trees shall be
located on the subject site whenever possible. However if this is not feasible,
the Landscape Administrator has the authority to allow the planting to take
place on another property, including public property. Franchise utility
companies shall be exempt from this requirement. If the Landscape Administrator
approves the planting of replacement trees more than 30 days after the removal
of protected trees, the applicant shall provide the Landscape Administrator
with an affidavit that all replacement trees will be planted within six months.
Any replacement tree required by this chapter must be covered by a one-year
warranty that is acceptable to the Landscape Administrator.
   (C)   Tree Reforestation Fund. In a densely forested area, the applicant,
upon approval of the Landscape Administrator, may make a payment into the Tree
Reforestation Fund in lieu of planting the replacement tree on the subject
site. The funds shall be used for: purchasing and planting trees on public
property; acquiring wooded property which shall remain in a naturalistic state
in perpetuity; and any irrigation, administrative and other costs incurred by
the city while pursuing the activities described herein and other activities in
support of tree planting, preservation and maintenance, and the general purpose
and intent of this chapter. The amount of the payment required for each
replacement tree shall be calculated based on a schedule published periodically
by the Landscape Administrator which sets forth the average cost of a quality
tree added to the average cost of planting a tree.

§ 99.38 TREE PROTECTION.
   A major purpose of this chapter is to protect all protected trees which are
not required to be removed to allow approved construction to occur. The
following procedures are required.
   (A)   Construction plan requirements. All construction plans shall include
the requirements noted in Appendix E.
   (B)   Prohibited activities. The following activities shall be prohibited
within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree subject to
the requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   Material storage. No materials intended for use in construction or
waste materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be placed
within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree. However,
this restriction shall not apply to material storage in areas exempt from the
tree protection and replacement requirements (for example, building pad,
driveway, patio, parking lot and the like.)
      (2)   Equipment cleaning/liquid disposal. No equipment shall be cleaned
or other liquids deposited or allowed to flow overland within the limits of the
critical root zone of a protected tree. This includes, without limitation,
paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or similar materials.
      (3)   Tree attachments. No signs, wires or other attachments, other than
those of a protective nature shall be attached to any protected tree.
      (4)   Vehicular traffic. No vehicular and/or construction equipment
traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone
of any protected tree other than on an existing street pavement. This
restriction does not apply to single incident access within the critical root
zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and
associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility
maintenance or emergency restoration of utility service or routine mowing
operations.
      (5)   Grade changes. No grade changes shall be allowed within the limits
of the critical root zone of any protected tree unless adequate construction
methods are approved by the Landscape Administrator or if grading is as
directed by the city's drainage inspector.
      (6)   Impervious paving. No paving with asphalt, concrete or other
impervious materials in a manner which may reasonably be expected to kill a
tree shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected
tree except as otherwise allowed in this chapter.
   (C)   Preserved tree. A protected tree shall be considered to be preserved
only if a minimum of 75% of the critical root zone is maintained at undisturbed
natural grade and no more than 25% of the canopy is removed due to building
encroachment.
   (D)   Prior to construction. The following procedures shall be followed on
all types of construction projects (including residential subdivisions,
commercial, multi family, industrial developments, residential builders and
municipal/public).
      (1)   Tree flagging or marking. Trees that are approved by the Landscape
Administrator for removal shall be flagged with bright fluorescent orange vinyl
tape wrapped around the main trunk or marked with bright fluorescent orange
paint at a height of four feet or more such that it is very visible to workers
operating construction equipment. This shall not include the flagging or
marking of all protected trees adjacent to right-of-ways within approved
residential subdivisions during the construction of the roadway. Trees that are
not flagged or marked shall be saved and protected by fencing in accordance
with the requirements in division (D)(2).
      (2)   Protective fencing. In those situations where a protected tree is
so close to the construction area that construction equipment might infringe on
the root system or is within 20 feet of the construction area, a protective
fencing shall be required between the outer limits of the critical root zone of
the tree and the construction activity area. Four feet high protective fencing
shall be supported at a maximum of ten feet intervals by approved methods. All
protective fencing shall be in place prior to commencement of any site work and
remain in place until all exterior work has been completed.
      (3)   Bark protection. In situations where a protected tree remains in
the immediate area of intended construction, the tree shall be protected by
enclosing the entire circumference of the tree with 2" x 4" lumber encircled
with wire or other means that do not damage the tree. The intent here is to
protect the bark of the tree against incidental contact by construction
equipment.
   (E)   Permanent construction methods.
      (1)   Boring. Where it is not possible to trench around the critical root
zone of a protected tree, boring of utilities under the protected tree shall be
required. The length of the bore shall at least be the width of the critical
root zone and the depth of the bore shall at least be 24 inches.
      (2)   Grade change. In situations where the grade change within the
critical root zone of a protected tree exceeds the limits noted in division (B)
of this section, the procedures noted in the city standard detail sheet shall
be required.
      (3)   Trenching. All trenching shall be designed to avoid trenching
across the critical root zone of any protected tree. Although this section is
not intended to prohibit the placement of underground services such as
electric, phone, gas and the like, the placement of these utilities is
encouraged to be located outside of the critical root zone of protected trees.
Irrigation system trenching shall be placed outside of the critical root zone
with only the minimum required single head supply line allowed within that area
placed radially to the tree trunk.
      (4)   Root pruning. All roots two inches or larger in diameter which are
exposed as a result of trenching or other excavation shall be cut off square
with a sharp medium tooth saw and covered with pruning compound within two
hours of initial exposure.

§ 99.39 TREE PRUNING RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   General. No protected tree should be pruned in a manner which
significantly disfigures the tree without proper cause or in a manner which
would reasonably lead to the death of the tree. All pruning shall be conducted
in accordance with universally accepted arboricultural standards and the
regulations contained in this chapter.
   (B)   Permit requirements. All franchise utility companies shall be required
to maintain at the city a set of pruning specifications (updated annually) to
be followed by all pruning contractors working for the company within the city.
Prior to beginning any pruning not requested by the owner of the tree, the
contractor for a non-franchise entity shall submit to the city an application
for a pruning permit for approval. Utility companies may prune trees as
necessary to maintain safe and reliable service or to re-establish disrupted
electric service without obtaining a permit. Prior notification of any pruning
activity shall be given to the city within 72 hours of work commencing.
   (C)   Allowed pruning. The Landscape Administrator may approve pruning of a
protected tree in cases where protected trees must be strategically pruned to
allow construction or demolition of a structure. When allowed, all pruning
shall be in accordance with §
99.38(C), approved Arboricultural techniques and the recommendations of
Appendix F. This section is not intended to require a tree permit for
reasonable pruning performed or contracted to be performed by the owner of the
tree when unrelated to construction activity.
   (D)   Required pruning. The owners of all trees adjacent to public right-of-
way shall be required to maintain a minimum clearance of 14 feet above the
traveled pavement or curb of a public street. Said owners shall also remove all
dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute
a menace to the safety of the public. The city shall also have the right to
prune trees overhanging within public right-of-way which interfere with the
proper spread of light along the street from a street light or interfere with
visibility of any traffic control device or sign or as necessary to preserve
the public safety.
   (E)   Tree topping. It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any
person, firm or city department to top any street tree, park tree or other tree
on public property. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or
certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning
practices are impractical may be exempted from this chapter at the
determination of the Landscape Administrator.

of overhead utility lines.
   (B)   Proximity to utilities. Any required replacement trees or street trees
shall not be planted within five feet of electrical facilities (underground or
surface), public utility lines, including water lines, sewer lines,
transmission lines or other utilities. No trees shall be planted within ten
feet of a fire hydrant. Shrubs will be permitted outside of the minimum
clearance of surface electrical facilities established by the franchise
electrical company.
   (C)   Street corners. No street tree shall be planted closer than 25 feet of
any street comer, measured from the point of nearest intersecting curbs or
curblines.

establishments set forth §
112.04 of this chapter. The Location Appeal Board shall follow the rules and
procedures set forth in this section.

an applicant because the location of the adult entertainment establishment is
in violation of §
112.04, then the applicant may, not later than ten calendar days after

for an exemption from the location restrictions.
   (C)   If the written request is filed with the city secretary within the

restrictions of §

      (1)   That the location of the adult entertainment establishment will not
have a detrimental effect on nearby properties or be contrary to the public
safety or welfare;
      (2)   That the location of the adult entertainment establishment will not
downgrade the property values or quality of life in the adjacent areas or
encourage the development of urban blight;
      (3)   That the location of the adult entertainment establishment in the
area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation nor will
it interfere with any efforts of urban renewal or restoration; and
      (4)   That all other applicable provisions of this chapter will be
observed.
   (F)   In making the findings specified above, the Board shall take into
account, among other things:

decline or increase in property values;
      (3)   Vacancy rates of residential, commercial, or office space within
the surrounding 1,000-foot radius, without regard to city boundaries; and
      (4)   Any evidence regarding the award or denial of any public or private
grants for neighborhood conservation, urban renewal, or restoration for any
property located within a 1,000-foot radius, without regard to city boundaries.
   (G)   The Board shall grant or deny the exemption by a majority vote.

preponderance of the evidence. The decision of the Location Appeal Board is
final.
   (H)   If the Board grants the exemption, the exemption is valid for one year
from the date of the Board's action. Upon the expiration of an exemption, the
adult entertainment business is in violation of the locational restrictions of
§
112.04 until the applicant applies for and receives another exemption.
   (I)   If the Board denies the exemption, the applicant may not reapply for
an exemption until at least 12 months have elapsed since the date of the
Board's action.
   (J)   The grant of an exemption does not exempt the applicant from any
provisions of this chapter other than the locational restrictions.

that use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual
predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders
are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses and
most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are
ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This
makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while
incalculable, clearly exorbitant. It is the intent of this section to serve the
city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety
and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations
where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain
sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing
temporary or permanent residences.

dwelling that:

family; and
         (b)   Contain one or more kitchens, one or more bathrooms and one or
more bedrooms.
      PERMANENT RESIDENCE. A place where the person abides, lodges or resides
for 14 or more consecutive days.
      SCHOOL. Shall include any property owned by a school district which has
been designated, defined, platted or identified to the city as a future site
for any school.
      TEMPORARY RESIDENCE. A place where the person abides, lodges or resides
for a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and
which is not the person's permanent address, or a place where the person
routinely abides, resides or lodges for a period of four or more consecutive or
non-consecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent
residence.
   (C)   It is unlawful for any person who is required to register as a sex
offender under Ch. 62 of the Tex. Code of Criminal Procedure, to establish a
permanent residence or temporary residence within 1,000 feet of a public or
private school, day care facility, playground, public or private youth center,

playground, public or private youth center, public swimming pool or video
arcade facility, to the property line of the person’s residence; or
      (2)   In a direct line from the property line of the public or private
school to the property line of the person's residence, and in a direct line
across intersections; or

to the base of the floor on which the person's residence is located.

of the following apply:
      (1)   The person established the permanent or temporary residence prior
to April 28, 2008, the date of adoption of the section, has complied, and
remains complicit with, all the sex offender registration laws of the state;
      (2)   The person was a minor when he or she committed the offense and was
not convicted as an adult;
      (3)   The person is a minor; or
      (4)   The premises specified in division (C) was opened after the person

   (F)   A person who is a registered sex offender or required to register as a

violation, the victim in the case was:
         (a)   Between 14 and 17 years of age;

thereof, due to all dead and live loads, is more than one and one half times
the working stress or stresses allowed in the building code for new buildings
of similar structure, purpose or location.
         (d)   Whenever any portion thereof has been damaged by fire,
earthquake, wind, flood or by any other cause, to such an extent that the
structural strength or stability thereof is materially less than it was before
such catastrophe, and is less than the minimum requirements of the building
code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose or location.
         (e)   Whenever any portion, member or appurtenance thereof is likely
to fail, to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse, and thereby injure
persons or damage property.
         (f)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance
or ornamentation on the exterior thereof, is not of sufficient strength or
stability, or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of one half of that specified in the
building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose or location,
without exceeding the working stresses permitted in the building code for such
buildings.
         (g)   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped, buckled or
settled to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have
materially less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case
of similar new construction.

is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used.
         (j)   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural members

center of gravity does not fall inside the middle one third of the base.
         (k)   Whenever the building, exclusive of the foundation, shows 33% or
more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members, or 50% or
more damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members, enclosing or

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Texas Water Code § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City of Mansfield Texas does ordain as follows.
(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of Mansfield are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)
§ 151.03 APPROVED PLATS.
   Platted lots approved prior to the adoption of this chapter with minimum
finished floor elevations will not be affected by the finished floor elevation
requirements of this chapter. Approved finished floor elevation prior to the
adoption of this chapter shall be in compliance with previous ordinance
requirements.
(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)
§ 151.04 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)
§ 151.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)

however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions
or (2) Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic
structure”.

management regulation. (For full requirements see § 60.6 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations).
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)
(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time
as that documentation is provided.

      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in
divisions (A) through (I) of this section are met, and (ii) the structure or
other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during
the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

§ 151.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   (A)   In unnumbered A zones (flood hazard areas without base flood
elevations where use of the best available data is required) it shall be
required that the base flood elevation be established through an engineering
study using fully urbanized hydrology, and such data shall be used for
requiring the lowest floor elevation as specified herein below unless waived by
the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data
has been provided as set forth in (i) §
151.08, (ii) §

151.42(C), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated to three feet above the base flood elevation where FEMA
Flood Insurance Study data exists or two feet above the base flood elevation as
determined by a study using fully urbanized hydrology. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this subsection as
proposed in §
151.27(A)(1), is satisfied.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. new construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to three feet
above the base flood elevation where FEMA Flood Insurance Study data exists or
two feet above the base flood elevation as determined by a study using fully
urbanized hydrology or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for
the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this
subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided;

§ 151.42 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with §§
151.02 through
151.04 of this chapter.
   (B)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain
development permit requirements of §
151.09; §
151.27; and the provisions of §§
151.40 through

(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)
§ 151.43 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.08, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable,
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to three feet
above the base flood elevation where FEMA Flood Insurance Study data exists or
two feet above the base flood elevation as determined by a study using fully
urbanized hydrology or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least three feet if no
depth number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to three feet
above the base flood elevation where FEMA Flood Insurance Study data exists or
two feet above the base flood elevation as determined by a study using fully
urbanized hydrology or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth
number is specified); or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the Base
Flood Elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
151.27 are satisfied.
   (D)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)
§ 151.44 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways are designated as areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.08. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion
potential, the following provisions shall apply.
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
151.40 through
151.44.
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the
provisions required by § 65.12.
(Ord. OR-1871-13, passed 4-8-13)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person, firm, corporation, agent or employee
thereof who violates any provision of this chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall upon conviction be found guilty of a misdemeanor and
be fined not more than $2,000 for each violation, and in addition shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day a violation occurs is a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(2), no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against
that development unless the number of service units increases, as set forth
under §
153.09.
      (4)   Following the lapse or expiration of approval of a residential
plat, a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for
subdivision approval is filed.
   (B)   Nonresidential development.
      (1)   The character of nonresidential development does not lend itself to
the assessment of a roadway impact fee at the time of subdivision plat
processing. It is frequently not possible for a land owner or developer to
identify the specific type of use that will occur in a nonresidential
development at the subdivision platting point because a lease with a
perspective tenant may not yet have been executed.
      (2)   Assessment of the impact fee for any new nonresidential development
shall be made as follows.
         (a)   For a development which is submitted for approval pursuant to
the city subdivision regulations following the effective date of this chapter,
assessment shall be at the time of recordation of the final plat. The
assessment shall be at the maximum assessable impact fees per service unit then
in effect, as provided in Exhibit D to this chapter. The fee to be collected at
the time of building permit issuance shall be at the current collected roadway
impact fee per land use category per service area as provided in §
153.26.
         (b)   For a development which has received preliminary or final plat
approval pursuant to the city subdivision regulations before the effective date
of this chapter, an impact fee shall be assessed and collected on development
within the approved subdivision plat at the time of building permit issuance,
except for one year after the effective date of this chapter, the fee to be
collected at the time of building permit issuance shall be at the current
collected roadway impact fee per land use category per service area previously
adopted via Ordinance No. OR-1955-15.
      (3)   Following the assessment of the impact fee for nonresidential
development pursuant to the provisions of this section, no additional impact
fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against the development unless the
number of service units increases.

§ 153.26 CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES.
   Following the request for new development as provided in §
153.25 of this chapter, the city shall compute impact fees due for the new
development in the following manner.
   (A)   In calculating roadway impact fees for a new development, it is first
necessary to identify in which service area the development is located and then
classify the development in one of the land use categories depicted in the
updated current collected roadway impact fee per land use category per service
area as set forth in Exhibit G of Ordinance No. OR-2398-24, incorporated and
made a part hereof by reference.
   (B)   The final determination of the roadway impact fee to be charged each
new development is then calculated by multiplying the updated current collected
roadway impact fee for the corresponding service area and land use category
identified above by the total development units (in number of dwelling units,
square footage in 1,000 square foot increments or other development unit
increments as indicated in the second column of Exhibit G of Ordinance No. OR-
2398-24.

passed 12-9-24)
§ 153.27 COLLECTION OF IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   No final residential plat shall be signed and released for recording
until all impact fees, including roadway impact fees, have been assessed except
as provided otherwise by contract. For a residential development which is
submitted for preliminary plat approval pursuant to the city's subdivision
regulations subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, impact fees shall
be assessed at the time of final plat approval.
   (B)   All roadway impact fees shall be collected for residential development
at the time of building permit issuance.
   (C)   All roadway impact fees shall be collected for nonresidential
development at time of building permit issuance.
   (D)   For one year after the effective date of this section, the roadway
impact fees to be collected from development on lots within a subdivision that
has either preliminary or final plat approval from the city before the
effective date of this section shall be at the current collected roadway impact
fee per land use category per service area previously adopted via Ordinance No.
OR-1955-15. Following the expiration of one year from the effective date of
this section, development on lots previously platted shall be subject to the
current collected roadway impact fee per land use category per service area
then in effect, as provided in Exhibit F to Ordinance OR-2280-22.
   (E)   The city may, at its sole discretion, establish a different date of
fee collection than those provided in this section.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99; Am. Ord. OR-1757-09, passed 11-23-09; Am. Ord. OR-
1955-15, passed 7-27-15; Am. Ord. OR-2280-22, passed 11-14-22)
§ 153.28 (RESERVED).
§ 153.29 OFFSETS AND CREDITS AGAINST IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   The city may offset the present value of any system-related
facilities, pursuant to rules established in this section, which have been
dedicated to and have been received by the city, including the value of capital
improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city as set forth in
§
153.48, against the value of the impact fee due for that category of capital
improvement.
   (B)   Any subdivision which has paid a perimeter street fee pursuant to the
provisions of the city subdivision ordinance shall be exempt from the payment
of a roadway impact fee for that development as the City Council has determined
that it is appropriate to give a 100% credit for roadway fee payments to such
developments. A development that has received a refund of a perimeter street
fee payment pursuant to § 10B of the city subdivision ordinance shall not be
entitled to such a credit. A subdivision that has received only preliminary
plat approval on the effective date of this chapter and has been identified as
being subject to the payment of a perimeter street fee prior to final plat
approval shall be required to pay the perimeter street fee prior to final plat
release but shall not be assessed roadway impact fees if the perimeter street
fee is paid within 12 months following the effective date of this chapter. A
development that has not paid its perimeter street fee within 12 months
following the effective date of this chapter shall lose its exemption and shall
be assessed an impact fee in the same manner as any other development of a
comparable character. Contemporaneously with the consideration of this chapter,
the City Council is contemplating an amendment of the subdivision control
ordinance to delete the requirement for certain subdivisions to pay perimeter
street fees unless the fee has already been assessed in a preliminary or final
plat approval prior to the effective day of this chapter.
   (C)   The city shall credit impact, pro rata, acreage or lot fees which have
been paid pursuant to other city ordinances prior to the effective date of this
chapter against the value of impact fees due for that category of capital
improvement, subject to guidelines established by the city.
   (D)   All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be subject to the
following limitations and shall be granted based on this chapter and additional
standards promulgated by the city which may be adopted as administrative
guidelines.
      (1)   No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or
construction of site-related facilities.
      (2)   The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those
assumed for the capital improvements included in the Capital Improvements Plan
for the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee
is imposed.
      (3)   If an offset or credit applicable to a plat has not been exhausted
within ten years from the date of the acquisition of the first tap purchase
made after the effective date of this chapter or within such period as may be
otherwise designated by contract, the offset or credit shall lapse.
      (4)   In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer
for an offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be
collected pursuant to this chapter or for any value exceeding the total impact
fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless
otherwise agreed to by the city.
   (E)   An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit
against impact fees due for the development either at or before the time of fee
payment, unless the city agrees to a different time. The applicant shall file a
petition for offsets or credits with the city on a form provided for such
purpose. The contents of the petition shall be established by administrative
guidelines. The city must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on
the offset or credit request, including the reasons for the decision. The
decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset or credit which may be
applied against an impact fee, which value and the date of the determination
shall be associated with the plat for the new development.
   (F)   The available offset or credit associated with the plat shall be
applied against an impact fee in the following manner.
      (1)   The offset or credit shall be prorated equally among all living
units equivalent (LUE), as calculated in §
153.09, and remain applicable to the LUE's, to be applied at time of filing and
acceptance of an application for a building permit or tap purchase, as
appropriate, against impact fees due.
      (2)   If the total number of LUE's used by the city in the original
offset or credit calculation described in subsection (F)(1) is eventually
exceeded by the number of total LUE's realized by the actual development, the
city may, at its sole discretion, collect the full impact fee exclusive of any
associated offset or credits for the excess LUE's.
      (3)   At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credit
or offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines
promulgated by the city.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99)
§ 153.30 ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTS AND RECORDS.
   (A)   The city shall establish separate interest-bearing accounts in a bank
authorized to receive deposits of city funds for each major category of capital
facility for which an impact fee is imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Interest earned by each account shall be credited to that account and
shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds authorized in §
153.31.
   (C)   The city shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to
ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the
purposes authorized in §
153.31. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as
are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter;
provided, however, that any fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable
period of time, but not to exceed ten years from the date the fee is deposited
into the account.
   (D)   The city shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for each
such account, which shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues,
which shall account for all monies received and which shall ensure that the
disbursement of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively
for the provision of uses specified in the capital improvements program as
system-related capital projects. The City Finance Department shall also
maintain such records as are necessary to ensure that refunds are appropriately
made under the provision in §
153.46 of this chapter and any other information as may be necessary for the
proper implementation of this chapter.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99)
§ 153.31 USE OF PROCEEDS OF CAPITAL RECOVERY FEE ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   The impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter may be used to
finance or to recoup capital construction costs of service. Impact fees may
also be used to pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on
bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance
the capital improvements or facilities expansions.
   (B)   Impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall not be used to
pay for any of the following expenses:
      (1)   Construction, acquisition or expansion of capital improvements or
assets other than those identified for the appropriate utility in the Capital
Improvements Plan.
      (2)   Repair, operation or maintenance of existing or new capital
improvements or facilities expansions.
      (3)   Upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to
serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety, efficiency,
environmental or regulatory standards.
      (4)   Upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to
provide better service to existing development; provided however, that impact
fees may be used to pay the costs of upgrading, expanding or replacing existing
capital improvements in order to meet the need for new capital improvements
generated by new development.
      (5)   Administrative and operating costs of the city.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 153.45 APPEALS.
   (A)   The property owner or applicant for new development may appeal the
following decisions to the Director, or his/her designate:
      (1)   The applicability of an impact fee to the development.
      (2)   The value of the impact fee due.
      (3)   The availability or the value of an offset or credit.
      (4)   The application of an offset or credit against an impact fee due.
      (5)   The amount of the refund due, if any.
   (B)   All appeals shall be taken within 30 days of notice of the action from
which the appeal is taken.
   (C)   The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the
value of the fee or the value of the offset or credit was not calculated
according to the applicable impact fee schedule or the guidelines established
for determining offsets and credits.
   (D)   The appellant may appeal the decision of the Director to the Council.
A notice of appeal to the Council must be filed by the applicant with the City
Secretary within 30 days following the Director's decision. If the notice of
appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the
City Attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact
fee due, the development application, subdivision plat, tap purchase or
building permit issuance may be processed while the appeal is pending.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99)
§ 153.46 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Any impact fee, or portion thereof, collected pursuant to this chapter
which has not been expended within ten years from the date of payment, shall be
refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property at the time the
refund is paid, or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity,
to the governmental entity.
   (B)   If a refund is due pursuant to division (A), the city shall pro-rate
the same by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the
amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units actually
developed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due
per service unit. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall
be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of
service units for the development for which the fee was paid and interest due
shall be calculated upon that amount.
   (C)   Petition for refunds shall be submitted to the Director on a form
provided by the city for such purpose. Within one month of the date of receipt
of a petition for refund, the Director must provide the petitioner, in writing,
with a decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision.
If a refund is due to the petitioner, the Director shall notify the Finance
Director and request that a refund payment be made to the petitioner. The
petitioner may appeal the determination to the Council, as set forth in §
153.45.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99)

§ 153.48 AGREEMENT FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   The City Council may authorize the owner of a new development to construct
or finance some of the public improvements identified in the CIP. In the case
of the approval, the property owner must enter into an agreement with the city
prior to fee collection. The agreement shall be on a form approved by the city
and shall establish the estimated cost of improvement, the schedule for
initiation and completion of the improvement, a requirement that the
improvement shall be completed to city standards and any other terms and
conditions the city deems necessary. The Director shall review the improvement
plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is
contained in the CIP and determine the method and timing of reimbursing the
owner for construction costs from impact fee or other revenues.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99)
§ 153.49 USE OF OTHER FINANCING MECHANISMS.
   (A)   The city may finance roadway capital improvements or facilities
expansions designated in the Capital Improvements Plan through the issuance of
bonds, through the formation of public improvement districts or other
assessment districts, or through any other authorized mechanism, in such manner
and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law, in addition to the
use of impact fees.
   (B)   Except as herein otherwise provided, the assessment and collection of
an impact fee shall be additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution
of, any other tax, fee, charge or assessment which is lawfully imposed on and
due against the property.
(Ord. 1293, passed 12-14-99)
§ 153.50 IMPACT FEES AS ADDITIONAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATION.
   (A)   Impact fees established by this chapter are additional and
supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by
the city on the development of land or the issuance of building permits or the
sale of water or wastewater taps or the issuance of certificates of occupancy.
The fees are intended to be consistent with and to further the policies of
City's Comprehensive Plan, Capital Improvements Plan, zoning ordinance,
subdivision regulations and other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by
which the city seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities in
conjunction with the development of land.
   (B)   This chapter shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of
property, density of development, design and improvement standards and
requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of
public improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other
regulations of the city, which shall be operative and remain in full force and
effect without limitation with respect to all such development.

§ 153.51 RELIEF PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Any person who has paid an impact fee or an owner of land upon which
an impact fee has been paid may petition the Council to determine whether any
duty required by this chapter has not been performed within the time so
prescribed. The petition shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the
unperformed duty and request that the act be performed within 60 days of the
request. If the Council determines that the duty is required pursuant to this
chapter and is late in being performed, it shall cause the duty to commence

   (B)   The Council may grant a variance or waiver from any requirement of
this chapter upon written request by a developer or owner of property subject
to this chapter, following a public hearing, upon finding that a strict
application of the requirement would, when regarded as a whole, result in
confiscation of the property.

§ 155.005 INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall be interpreted, whenever an administrator or the
judiciary is called upon to do so, in conformance with the purposes intended by
the City Council, to be served by its enactment. The intent of the standards
and supporting definitions is to protect both individual property owners and
the general public from adverse impacts which might otherwise be the result of
a proposed use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this chapter shall
proceed as follows:
      (1)   Determine the public purpose(s) of the standard(s) with respect to
which an interpretation is required. Before any zoning interpretation is made,
there must be an explicit identification of the purpose(s) for which the
regulation was initially imposed. Each zoning regulation is intended to protect
the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public. Each
standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable negative
impact or potential impact. A sound interpretation of any such standard cannot
be insured without a careful analysis of the end to which the regulation is
directed.
      (2)   Determine the actual impact of a proposed interpretation. There is
a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater
degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation
which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be
enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the
ordinance.
      (3)   Determine that the proposed interpretation will insure a just
balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected
by that person's land use proposal. If an interpretation merely would allow a
design solution which is more flexible, albeit slightly different from the one
expressly stated and if it results in no less a degree of protection to any
affected party, such an interpretation may be appropriately made. Any
interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection or
which would increase the nuisance potential of any use should not be made by an
administrator. Any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection
or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted should only be made when
the party interpreting the ordinance has the power to impose additional
restrictions or conditions to protect the public and exercises this power.
   (B)   All interpretation should be recorded in writing at the City
Secretary's office. Such records shall be used for future review as related
issues arise so that consistency between actions over time can be assured. All
records of ordinance interpretations shall include both consenting and/or
dissenting opinions from all parties.

SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 155.065 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The special purpose subchapter is designed as an inclusive subchapter that
establishes sets of standards for uses or areas that deserve specific,
independent considerations. None of the districts contained in this subchapter
are cumulative.
(Ord. 671, passed 4-15-86)
§ 155.066 PD, PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. This district is intended to accommodate unified design of
residential, commercial, office, professional services, retail and
institutional uses and facilities or combinations thereof in accordance with an
approved comprehensive development plan. This district is designed to permit
flexibility and encourage a more creative, efficient and aesthetically
desirable design and placement of buildings, open spaces, circulation patterns
and parking facilities in order to best utilize special site features of
topography, size or shape.
   (B)   Permitted uses. Uses permitted in a PD, Planned Development District,
are set forth in §
155.054.
   (C)   Development standards and regulations.
      (1)   Height regulations. The maximum height requirement for permissible
uses in this district shall be established on the approved development plan
with due regard to site and general area characteristics including land use,
zoning, topography and setbacks, etc.
      (2)   Density regulations. The density requirement for development shall
be established on the approved development plan taking into account the goals
and objectives, planning principles, and guidelines in the adopted Master Land
Use Plan.
      (3)   Open space regulations. Provisions for public, private and common
open space shall be evaluated with due regard to density, site coverage, and
physical characteristics of the site. Common open space must be usable for
recreational activities including but not limited to playgrounds, trails, or
other passive or active play areas. No open space shall be proposed that is
less than 20 feet in width to accommodate a minimum section of trail surface,
landscape buffer area and space for maintenance. Ownership and maintenance of
these areas must be addressed with the plan proposal.
      (4)   Off-street parking regulations. The off-street parking requirements
shall be established on the approved development plan and generally in
accordance with § 155.091, hereof. The location, number of spaces and size of
parking areas shall be evaluated with due regard to vegetation, topography, and
other physical characteristics of the site.
      (5)   Setback regulations. The setback requirements shall be established
on the approved development plan.
      (6)   Masonry construction standards. The masonry construction standards
shall be established on the approved development plan.
      (7)   Landscaping and screening regulations. The landscaping and
screening requirements shall be established on the approved development plan
but shall not be less than the minimum requirements for development prescribed
in §
155.092 unless a reduction, change or modification of the landscaping and
screening requirements is approved by the City Council as part of the
development plan.
      (8)   Tree preservation and mitigation. Preservation of trees shall be
evaluated with due regard to aesthetics and other physical characteristics
(e.g. topography, view corridors, utilities, access) of the site. This
evaluation should be made prior to the design and layout of proposed
improvements such that the environment suggests design. The requirements for
tree preservation and mitigation shall be established through the policies and
procedures prescribed in the Natural Resources Management Ordinance in
cooperation with the Landscape Administrator. The city deems it necessary that
a developer consult with the Landscape Administrator as early in the site
search, acquisition and planning process as possible so as to minimize negative
impacts on the development.

      (1)   A concept plan shall be required as a pre-requisite to any
application for PD, Planned Development zoning.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council will each hold
a public hearing to review the proposed concept plan. The review of the concept
plan does not grant any change in zoning. It merely allows the applicant to
seek a conceptual review before spending the necessary resources to prepare a
development plan.
      (3)   After the concept plan review and a favorable indication from
Planning and Zoning and Council, the applicant may submit a formal application
for zoning change to a Planned Development District and for approval of a
development plan. Such application shall be submitted in accordance with the
provisions of §
155.115. The procedures for hearing said zoning change application and for
approval of the development plan shall be the same as for an application for
any other zoning change.
      (4)   The applicant has the option to by-pass the concept plan review
process if prepared to submit a development plan without any prior indication
from the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council regarding the
development concept.
      (5)   Prior to considering an application for a zoning change to a
Planned Development District and development plan, the City Council shall
request a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (6)   After receiving the Planning and Zoning Commission's
recommendation, the City Council shall hold a public hearing to consider the
application.
      (7)   After the public hearing, City Council may approve the original
application and development plan or modify the development plan as deemed
appropriate by the City Council.
      (8)   The approved development plan and the associated development
standards and regulations to be observed on the Planned Development District
shall be specified and incorporated as part of the ordinance establishing the
district. Every Planned Development District approved under the provisions of
this chapter shall be considered an amendment to the zoning ordinance and
zoning map.

155.092, as long as the minimum height and caliper requirements above are met.
If canopy trees are utilized, they shall be planted at the rate of one tree for
each 300 square feet or portion thereof, and shrubs shall be planted between
trees to provide adequate screening. The screening shrubs shall be planted no
further apart than four feet on center in two continuous, alternating rows so
that screening should be effective within two growing seasons. Screening shrubs
shall be a minimum of seven gallon or larger with a minimum height of three-
and-a-half feet at the time of planting and shall be chosen from the list in

color. The developer may propose an alternate color that the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council may determine to be appropriate for the
building design and not detract from the aesthetic quality of the development
and surrounding properties. The intent of this provision is to avoid drawing
attention to the service bay doors. Glass or transparent overhead doors shall
not be permitted.
         (i)   Vehicles awaiting repair or pickup may be stored overnight only
in enclosed spaces. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an auto paint and body shop
may store vehicles awaiting repair provided the vehicles are completely behind
a screening enclosure.

may be modified by the City Council if they find that the structure is
architecturally designed to effectively screen the service bay doors from view
from abutting properties and abutting public street or highway.
         (m)   The site plan, elevations, landscape plan, line of sight drawing
and perspective rendering/axonometric drawings that are submitted to
demonstrate architectural elements, effectiveness of screening, and

the same as the approved standard zoning district except that in no case shall
such set back be less than 20 feet from the property line.
      (3)   All other set backs including interior lot line, setbacks and set
backs on minor or collector streets, shall be in compliance with the approved
standard zoning district.

such hearing shall be given by the Director of Planning and mailed ten days
prior to the hearing date to the owners of all adjoining property and property
owners included in the proposed designation, using for this purpose the names
and addresses of the last known owners as shown on the latest real property tax
records received for the Tarrant County Tax Appraisal District. Failure to send
notice by mail to any such property owners where the addresses of such owners
are not so recorded shall not invalidate any proceedings in connection with the

      (4)   In making a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission

conformance of the proposed designation with the comprehensive plan of the City
of Mansfield and with the purposes and standards of this chapter.

respect to rezoning.
      (7)   Reapplication for "H" status shall be limited as outlined in §
155.115(E).
   (F)   Procedure to authorize erection, construction, reconstruction,
alterations of structures in a Historic Landmark Overlay District or site.
      (1)   No person shall carry out or cause to be carried out on a landmark
or in a Historic Landmark Overlay District, any alteration, demolition,
construction, reconstruction, restoration, or remodeling, nor shall any person
make any material change in the appearance on any existing landmark or in a
Historic Landmark Overlay District without a permit issued by the city Building
Official. All applications to the city Building Official for a permit involving
landmarks or Historic Landmark Overlay Districts shall be forwarded immediately
by the city Building Official to the Historic Landmark Commission.
Notwithstanding any other provision, or law, the city Building Official shall
not permit any alteration, demolition, construction, reconstruction,
restoration, remodeling, or any material change in appearance to be carried out
on a landmark or in a Historic Landmark Overlay District except pursuant to a
Certificate of Approval issued by the Historic Landmark Commission.
      (2)   The Historic Landmark Commission shall hold a public hearing on all
applications for Certificate of Approval referred to it after notice given in
the same manner as prescribed in division (E)(3). A report of the action taken
or determination made shall be forwarded to the city Building Official not
later than 45 days after receipt of the application by the Historic Landmark
Commission. If no action is taken by the Historic Landmark Commission within
the 45 day period, the permit shall be issued and the applicant notified by the
city Building Official.
      (3)   The Historic Landmark Commission in considering the appropriateness
of any alteration, demolition, new construction, reconstruction, restoration,
remodeling or other modification of any building shall consider, among other
things, the purposes of this chapter; the historical and architectural value
and significance of the landmark or Historic Landmark Overlay District; the
design guidelines as approved in this chapter under division (K)(1). Landmark
guidelines; the texture, material and color of the building or structure in
question or its appurtenant fixtures, including signs; and the relationship of
such features to similar features of other buildings within a Historic Landmark
Overlay District; and the position of such building or structure in relation to
the street or public way and to other buildings and structures.
      (4)   If after considering the foregoing, the Historic Landmark
Commission determines that the proposed changes are consistent with the
criteria for historic preservation established by this chapter, the Historic
Landmark Commission shall issue the Certificate of Approval. In the event of a
determination to deny a Certificate of Approval, the Historic Landmark
Commission shall request consultation with the owner for a period not to exceed
90 days for the purpose of considering means to preservation in keeping with
the criteria and design guidelines. If at the end of that time an acceptable
solution has not been achieved, the Certificate of Approval shall finally be
denied and the applicant so notified by letter; provided the applicant may
appeal to the City Council within 20 days of the date of the letter finally
denying the application, and the City Council may, after a public hearing,
reverse or modify the decision of the Historic Landmark Commission but only if
it finds that: (a) every reasonable effort has been made by the applicant to
agree to the requirements of the Commission; and (b) owing to special
conditions pertaining to the specific piece of property, denial of the
Certificate of Approval will cause undue and unnecessary hardship. The
Secretary of the Interior's Standards For Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings are the minimum guidelines that the Historic
Landmark Commission shall use to evaluate each landmark or Historic Landmark
Overlay District.
   (G)   Approval for demolition or removal. If an application is received by
the Planning Department for demolition or removal of any designated historic
landmark, it shall be forwarded to the Historic Landmark Commission upon
receipt of the application.

application involves improvements to existing buildings not historically and
culturally significant and not contributing to the integrity of the district,
it may approve the application for demolition or removal provided the owner
comply with the established guidelines for the landmark or Historic Landmark
Overlay District and the general purpose of this district in division (A) of
this section.
      (2)   Should the Historic Landmark Commission determine that the
demolition or removal activity will adversely affect any historical,
architectural, archaeological, or cultural feature of the historic landmark,
and whether such work is appropriate and consistent with the spirit and intent
of this section, it shall recommend restrictions or conditions to the
demolition or removal application.
      (3)   The Historic Landmark Commission may recommend the disapproval of
the application by determining that in the interest of preserving historical
values, the structure, building or site should not be demolished, and in that
event, the application shall be suspended for a period not exceeding 90 days
from the date of application. Within the suspension period, the Historic
Landmark Commission may request an extension of the suspension period by the
City Council. If the City Council, after notice to applicant and public
hearing, determines that there is reasonable grounds for preservation, the
Council may extend the suspension period for an additional period not exceeding
120 days, to a total of not more than 240 days from the date of application for
demolition. During the period of suspension of the application, no permit shall

remove the building, structure or site. If no action is taken by the City
Council within 240 days from the date of application, the demolition or removal
permit shall be issued and the city Building Official shall so advise the
applicant.
      (4)   This procedure is to allow the city, the owner and the private
sector to explore alternatives to demolition or removal which may provide
viable uses for the subject of the application. In addition, alternate
strategies of ownership and use may be explored with the owner, including use
of other remedies available to the city.
   (H)   Historic landmarks; omission of necessary repairs.
      (1)   The exterior of a designated historic landmark shall be maintained
to insure the structural soundness of such landmark.
      (2)   If the city Building Official and/or the Historic Landmark
Commission finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a designated
historic landmark is structurally unsound or in imminent danger of becoming
structurally unsound, the city Building Official will notify in writing the
owner of record of the designated historic landmark of such fact.
      (3)   Upon the giving of ten days written notice to the owner of record
of such designated historic landmark, the Historic Landmark Commission shall
hold a public hearing to determine if the designated historical building is
structurally unsound or in imminent danger of becoming structurally unsound.
The Historic Landmark Commission shall request a report and consider
recommendations from the city Building Official. The report may include
evidence of economic hardship or willful neglect.
      (4)   At the conclusion of the hearing, if the Historic Landmark
Commission finds that the designated historic building is structurally unsound
or in danger of becoming structurally unsound and that no valid reason exists
as to why the owner cannot or should not undertake to safeguard the structural
soundness of the building, it shall in writing notify the record owner of the
finding.
      (5)   The owner of record of a designated historic landmark who has been
notified by the Historic Landmark Commission that such landmark is structurally
unsound or in danger of so becoming shall within 90 days of receipt of such
notice satisfy the Historic Landmark Commission that reasonably necessary
repairs to safeguard the structural soundness of the landmark have been
effected.
      (6)   If the Historic Landmark Commission determines that the building is
structurally unsound but there are valid reasons why the owner cannot or should
not undertake to safeguard the structural soundness of the building, it shall
forward to the City Council its recommendation as to what action, if any,
should be taken on the structure.
      (7)   Any applicant or interested person aggrieved by a ruling of the
Historic Landmark Commission under the provisions of this section may, within
30 days after the ruling, appeal to the City Council.

Commission shall notify the City Building Official within 24 hours if it deems
that destruction of a possible eligible landmark building or site is imminent.
This notification shall be in writing and explain the reason for the action of
the Historic Landmark Commission. This notification authorizes the city
Building Official not to allow any building or demolition permits even though
no application for Historic Landmark Overlay District Zoning has been applied
for by the owner of the particular landmark building or structure in question.

institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful
construction, restoration, demolition, razing, or maintenance, to restrain,
correct, or abate such violation, to prevent any illegal act, business, or
maintenance on such premises.

otherwise adversely affect the structural, physical or visual integrity of the
historic structure or property.
      (3)   (a)   If the structural, physical or visual integrity of the
historic structure or property is adversely affected to the extent that it is
not feasible to restore the structural, physical or visual integrity
substantially to its former level, the damages are equal to the cost of
constructing, using as many of the original materials as possible, a new
structure or property that is a reasonable facsimile of the historic structure
or property plus the cost of attorney's, architect's, and appraiser's fees and
other costs related to the enforcement of this section.

pattern of development to increase the residential density and the intensity of
activity within the historic downtown in support of viable and diverse locally-
oriented businesses and cultural institutions;

to the past, the present, and the future generations, and allow them to
participate in its economic growth;

encouraged alongside larger development;
      (4)   That building regulations should equitably balance the rights of
the individual and the interests of the community as a whole;

supports the public realm;
      (6)   That building configuration should support walkability, safe
streets, and safe public spaces, creating pedestrian friendly neighborhoods;
      (7)   That building configuration should define streets and public spaces
as rooms, and should vary by context and intensity in coordination with
neighboring properties; and

and its surrounding areas should be secured through regulating the form of
buildings.

   (G)   Description of downtown zones. The D, Downtown District, is further
divided into three distinct downtown zones and one special district (D-zones)
using the rural-to-urban transect to provide neighborhood structure for the
historic downtown and environs. The rural-to-urban transect is a means for
considering and organizing the human environment according to intensities
ranging from the most rural condition to the most urban condition. The D-zones
are primarily classified by the: (i) physical intensity of the built form, (ii)
complexity of uses within the zone, and (iii) relationship between the natural
and built environment. The D-zones are calibrated to reflect existing and
future contexts and their descriptions shall be as follows:
      (1)   D-1, Sub-Urban Zone. This zone consists of residential areas with
some commercial and mixed-use activity adjacent to higher intensity zones. The
character of this zone consists of detached single-family residential
surrounded by lawns and landscaped yards with limited office. Pedestrians may
be occasionally present, and trees are within the public right-of-way.
      (2)   D-2, Urban Transition Zone. This zone consists of a mixed-use, but
a primarily residential urban fabric. The character of D-2 zones consists
predominately of attached buildings accommodating office, restaurant, and
retail mixed with row houses and small multi-family residential buildings.
There is substantial pedestrian activity in this zone and trees and public
lighting are within the public right-of-way.
      (3)   D-3, Urban Center Zone. This zone consists of mixed-use of the
greatest variety and the highest intensity. The character of this zone consists
of attached buildings that form a continuous street wall and accommodate
diverse entertainment, multi-family residential, office, restaurant, and
retail. The D-3 Zone has the highest pedestrian and transit activities; and

§ 155.073 S, SOUTH MANSFIELD FORM-BASED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Intent. The primary intent of this S, South Mansfield Form-Based
Development District, is to enable and to encourage a development pattern that
is compact, mixed-use, walkable, and sustainable. The secondary intent of this
form-based development district is to create and to reinforce a world-class
entertainment destination, that is in proximity to national and multi-national
corporations and small employers, and will promote the expansion of premium
retail, restaurant, residential, office, and cultural choices, will elevate the
quality of life for residents and businesses, and will contribute immensely to
a robust economic base for the community and immediate environs. To that end,
this form-based development district regulates the development and
redevelopment of property based on the following premises:
      (1)   That building regulations should equitably balance the rights of
the individual and the interests of the community as a whole.
      (2)   That building form individually and collectively defines and
supports the public realm.
      (3)   That building configuration should support walkability, safe
streets, and safe public spaces, creating pedestrian friendly neighborhoods.
      (4)   That building scale should define streets and public spaces as
rooms and they should vary by context and intensity in coordination with
neighboring properties.
      (5)   That workplace, retail, and entertainment, and housing for a
variety of ages and incomes are all in close proximity, with appealing open
spaces and gathering places.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   The provisions of this section shall be activated by "shall" or
"are" when required, and "may" when optional.
      (2)   The provisions of this section, when in conflict, shall prevail
over all those of other codes, ordinances, regulations, and standards of the
City of Mansfield, Texas (the "existing local codes").
      (3)   The existing local codes shall continue to be applicable to all
issues that are not covered by this section, except where the existing local
codes would be in conflict.
      (4)   The definitions and synonyms contains regulatory language that is
integral to this section. Those terms not defined in definitions and synonyms
shall be accorded their commonly accepted meanings. In the event of conflict
between these definitions and those specified in the existing local codes,
those of this section shall take precedence.
      (5)   The provisions of this section or the numerical metrics of its
tables, when in conflict with any diagrams and / or illustrations, shall take
precedence.
   (C)   Warrants and variances.
      (1)   There shall only be two types of deviations from the requirements
of this section: warrants and variances.
      (2)   A warrant is a ruling that shall permit a practice that is
inconsistent with a specific provision of this section, but is justified by the
intent of this section. The Director of Planning shall have the authority to
approve or to disapprove administratively any request for a warrant. The
Director of Planning warrant decisions may only be appealed to the City Manager
within 30 days of the Director of Planning warrant decision. The City Manager
warrant decisions may only be appealed to the City Council, and such appeal
must be made within 30 days of the City Manager warrant decision. All warrant
decision appeals shall be filed with the Director of Planning or their
designee.
      (3)   A variance is any ruling on a deviation from the requirements of
this section other than a warrant. Variances shall be granted only by the Board
of Adjustments, in accordance with the provisions existing in §
155.113, Board of Adjustments.
      (4)   A warrant shall not be available for any of the following:
         (a)   The minimum height for multi-family residential buildings;
         (b)   The required provision of rear alleys;
         (c)   The minimum requirements for parking;
         (d)   The allowable building functions and the specific functions by
transect zone; or
         (e)   To modify or to alter any provisions set forth in a development
plan.
   (D)   Development plan. All applications and plans for development or
redevelopment under this S, South Mansfield Form-Based Development District
shall be pursuant to a development plan reviewed and approved by the City
Council. A development plan shall be approved prior to submittal of any special
land assemblage plans and building plans and site plans for review and
approval. A development plan submitted to the City Council for review and
approval shall include a concept plan depicting proposed layout, proposed
transect zone boundaries, proposed civic space types, proposed development
intensity, proposed building types (including height), and any other applicable
attributes that may be required by the City Council. The development plan shall
additionally include a phasing plan for the development and modification of
buildings. A development plan shall be recorded in the public records and shall
be binding upon all purchasers of property within the project and it may only
be assigned subject to approval of the City Council. A development plan may
only be altered or modified subject to the approval of the City Council. In the
event that a property owner or a developer does not prepare (or have prepared
on their behalf) and present a development plan to the City Council within 90
days for review and approval of a rezoning to S, South Mansfield Form-Based
Development District, then the City Council is authorized to initiate a
rezoning of the property. The property owner or the developer shall abide by
the terms and conditions contained in the development plan. In the event of any
violation of any term or condition in the development plan, the City Council
shall have all rights of enforcement against the property owner or the
developer, all as provided in the existing local codes and the development
plan, including initiating rezoning of the property.
   (E)   Transect zones and special districts. For the purposes of this
section, the "rural-to-urban transect" is defined as a cross-section of the
environment showing a range of different habitats from the most rural to the
most urban condition. The rural-to-urban transect of the human environment that
is used in this section is divided into four "transect zones". Transect zones
are administratively similar to the land use zones found in conventional codes,
except that in addition to the usual building use, parking, height, and setback
requirements, other elements of the intended human habitat are also integrated,
including those of the private lot and building and the public frontage. These
transect zones describe the physical form and the character of a place,
according to the intensity of its land use. The methodology of the rural-to-
urban transect allows for a broad range of building types in each transect
zone, arranged to provide balanced, safe, and walkable streetscapes. The
development and modification of buildings and other elements of the built
environment within the private lot is regulated according to the following
transect zones and special districts. The transect zones are described on
Diagram 1.
      (1)   Urban Edge Transect Zone (T-3). A lower intensity residential area
that has some mixed-use. Outbuildings are permitted. Planting is naturalistic
and building setbacks are relatively deep. Blocks may be large and the roads
irregular to accommodate natural conditions.
      (2)   Urban Transition Transect Zone (T-4). A medium intensity area that
consists of a mixed-use, but a primarily residential urban fabric. It also
contains a wide range of building types. Planting and building setbacks are
variable. Streets typically define medium-sized blocks with buildings set near
to sidewalks.
      (3)   Urban Center Transect Zone (T-5). A medium-high intensity mixed-use
area that consists of buildings that accommodate retail, office, row houses,
and multi-family dwellings. It has a tight network of thoroughfares with wide
sidewalks and steady street tree planting and buildings set adjacent to the
sidewalks.
      (4)   Urban Core Transect Zone (T-6). A high intensity mixed-use area
that consists of the highest height, the greatest variety of uses, and civic
buildings of regional importance. Streets have steady street tree planting and
buildings are set close to wide sidewalks.
      (5)   Entertainment District (Special District No. 1). The entertainment
district is intended for the creation and reinforcement of an entertainment
destination for the community with select retail, residential, office, and
civic choices. All land bounded to the East by the future extension of Heritage
Parkway southward; to the West by State Highway 360; to the North by the
railroad right-of-way; and to the South by Lone Star Road, shall be assigned to
the entertainment district (Special District No. 1) and the provisions of this
section modified as follows:
         (a)   Building height for allowable civic uses shall be determined by
warrant.
         (b)   The following specific uses are not allowed:

limited-access highway shall be assigned to a regional center development
district (Special District No. 3) and the provisions of this section modified
as follows:
         (a)   Principal buildings shall be no less than 1,500 net square feet.
         (b)   Principal buildings shall be no less than four stories.
         (c)   Principal buildings less than four stories dedicated exclusively
to retail establishments or food service establishments may be approved by
warrant.
      (8)   Reserved.
      (9)   The standards for the special districts in this section overlap.
      (10)   A PD, planned development district, shall not be considered as
part of this form-based development district.
   (F)   Regulating plan. Reserved.
   (G)   Instructions. This section sets forth the standards that are
applicable to the development and the modification of buildings and other
elements of the built environment within private lots.

by the City Council or an application was withdrawn after the giving of public
notice, and such new application currently under consideration includes
property which was all or a part of the previously denied or withdrawn case,
and the application currently under consideration is for the same or a more
intense use as determined by the city; however, on receipt of written request
by the original applicant stating how conditions have changed substantially in
the community since prior consideration of his proposal so as to justify an
earlier review of this matter, the City Council may waive the mandatory delay
period and authorize the acceptance of a new application.

postponement of a scheduled public hearing on an application for industrial use
permit shall follow those for a specific use permit as set forth in §
155.115(F).

   (A)   Purpose. To assure that adequate off-street parking and loading areas
are provided with the construction, alteration, remodeling or change of use of
any building or change in the use of land.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Any person establishing an off-street parking facility or applying

      (2)   The plot plan shall be submitted to the Planning Department by the
Building Inspector, and the Director of Planning and Development shall approve

      (3)   Required off-street parking for residential uses in any PR, Single-
Family Residential, 2F, MF-1 and MF-2 Districts shall be provided on the lot or
tract occupied by the use being served. For non-residential uses in the
aforementioned districts and for permitted uses in all other zoning districts,
off-street parking shall be provided on the lot or tract occupied by the use
being served or upon a tract dedicated to parking use by an instrument filed
for record and consolidated under a single certificate of occupancy with the
main use. Such off-premise parking facility shall be located in the same or
less restrictive zoning district as the use being served, and all or part of
such facility shall be located within a distance not to exceed 300 feet to an
entrance to the building or use being served, measured along the shortest
available pedestrian route with public access.
      (4)   Any existing building or use that is enlarged, structurally
altered, or remodeled to the extent of increasing or changing the use by more
than 50% as it existed at the effective date of this chapter shall be
accompanied by off-street parking for the entire building or use in accordance
with the off-street parking regulations set forth in this section. When the
enlargement, structural alteration, or remodeling is to the extent that the use
is not increased or changed by more than 50%, additional off-street parking
shall only be required for the increased or changed floor area or use.
      (5)   Existing parking spaces may not be used to satisfy additional off-
street parking requirements of this chapter unless the existing spaces proposed
for use in meeting the requirements of this chapter exceed the number required
for the building or use for which the existing spaces are associated. All
parking associated with a building or use from which the spaces are drawn must
meet all requirements of this chapter.
      (6)   Head-in parking. The following provisions shall apply to all head-
in parking adjacent to a public thoroughfare:
         (a)   Head-in parking spaces so situated that the maneuverings of a
vehicle in entering or leaving such spaces is done on a public street or within
public right-of-way shall not be classified as off-street parking in computing
any parking requirements herein.
         (b)   The construction of head-in parking as described in division (a)
above shall be prohibited hereafter. All such head-in parking facilities in
existence at the time of the enactment of this section are hereby declared to
be a nonconforming use of land subject to the provisions of §
155.098.
         (c)   Off-street parking facility related to single or two family
dwellings and zero lot line dwellings shall be exempted from this section.
      (7)   No off-street parking facility shall be located, either in whole or

used for sales, non-vehicular storage, repair or service activities.
      (10)   Lighting facilities, if provided, shall be so arranged as to be
reflected away from motorists traveling in an adjacent street and from property
zoned or used for residential purposes.
      (11)   No pavement shall be permitted in the city rights-of-way or in any
required setback where parking facilities are prohibited unless such pavement
is intended for use as a drive approach approved for access to property or such
pavement is required to meet minimum city sidewalk standards.
      (12)   For all multi-family and non-residential uses, parking spaces
shall be striped or otherwise clearly designated on the parking facility
surface, and shall not include any fire lane or other area necessary for aisles
or maneuvering of vehicles.
      (13)   All facilities used for parking, loading, unloading, driveways and
all other vehicular access shall have a pavement constructed of concrete and
comply with all applicable Fire Code and City Engineering Standards; except
those for a single-family residential property that is required to provide a
fire apparatus access driveway may be constructed of alternative equivalent
strength material approved by the Director of Planning, provided that the drive
approach from the street be constructed of concrete. The pavement shall always
be maintained in good condition and repair.

compacted sub grade. The concrete pavement shall be reinforced with inch steel
bars spaced 18 inches on center each way or six by six, #6 gauge welded wire
fabric. An approved paving fiber may be substituted for the reinforcing steel.
Chairs shall be used to support reinforcement.
      (15)   In determining the required number of parking spaces, fractional
spaces shall be counted to the nearest whole space. Parking spaces located in
buildings needed for repair garages or auto laundry stalls shall not be counted
as meeting the required minimum parking.
      (16)   Where several different property uses will share a joint parking
area, the off-street parking requirements shall be the composite or sum of the
requirements for each type of use and no off-street parking space provided for
one type of use or building shall be included in calculation of off-street
parking requirements for any other uses of buildings.
      (17)   Floor-area of structure devoted to off-street parking of vehicles

tenants, clients and occupants of a use on a prearranged basis, other than an
hourly or fee basis, as free or contract parking.
      (19)   No vehicle shall be parked on a lot or tract occupied by a single-

into the yard between the driveway and the nearest property line, not to exceed
12 feet in width. Except for expansion joints, the paved extension must be
constructed as a solid, continuous span of concrete from the edge of the
driveway to the furthest edge of the paved extension.
         (b)   An existing lawful nonconforming driveway that does not conform
with the requirements in division (19) above may be extended into the yard
between the driveway and the nearest property line, not to exceed 12 feet in

etc.). However, an existing parking area of entirely grass cannot be extended
unless the extension conforms with the pavement requirements in division (A)
above.

with all applicable area, height and setback requirements for attached or
detached accessory buildings; or

structure protruding from the residence that is furthest from the street.
         (b)   No other vehicle shall be parked on a driveway between the side

      (24)   No vehicle shall be parked on a lot or tract occupied by a single-
family dwelling, two-family dwelling or townhouse when such vehicle is situated
on blocks, jacks or anything other than the wheels or mechanisms that are
originally designed to equip such vehicles for traveling purposes.
      (25)   Non-conforming status and exemptions.

automatically terminate upon a change in ownership or occupancy of a property
occupied by a single-family dwelling, two-family dwelling or townhouse upon
which the vehicle is parked.
         (e)   Any other vehicle parked on a lot or tract, occupied by a
single-family dwelling, two-family dwelling or townhouse, that is at least one-

§ 155.092 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Intent. The standards of this section promote public health, safety,
and welfare by establishing minimum standards for the design, the construction,
and the maintenance of landscape improvements for thoroughfares, open spaces,
and development. The standards of this section also enhance the overall
aesthetic condition of the community and public realm with landscaping by:
      (1)   Visually coordinating the public and private realms;
      (2)   Providing spatial definition to the public realm; and
      (3)   Providing for screening of unsightly places and/or mitigation of
visually incongruent conditions.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this section are the minimum
standards for all proposed projects in all zoning districts. Where the
provisions of this section are in conflict with those of the D, S, FR, SE, or
PD Districts, those of the D, S, FR, SE, or PD Districts shall govern. Where
the D, S, FR, SE, or PD Districts are silent on landscaping issues, the
provisions of this section shall govern. The landscape plans required by this
section are subject to administrative approval by the Landscape Administrator.
The Landscape Administrator may permit an alternate landscape practice if it is
consistent with the provisions of this section and furthers the public health,
safety, and welfare and community aesthetics.
   (C)   New development. For the purposes of this section, NEW DEVELOPMENT
shall be defined as any new construction on a vacant or an undeveloped lot or
any addition to existing construction that expands the floor area by the lesser
of 30% or 3,000 square feet in any MF-1, MF-2, OP, C-1, C-2, C-3, D, S, I-1, I-
2, FR, or PD Districts. All landscaping for new development shall be brought up
to the applicable standards of this section within one year from approval of
the landscape plan. For any new development, the Landscape Administrator may
not require that existing buildings, parking lots, retaining walls, or other
visual screens be brought up to the applicable standards of this section within
one year of approval of the landscape plan.
   (D)   Landscape plan required. A landscape plan shall be required for new
development projects in the MF-1, MF-2, OP, C-1, C-2, C-3, D, S, I-1, I-2, FR,
SE, and PD Districts prior to the issuance of any required permit. A landscape
plan shall be prepared by a Registered Landscape Architect (“RLA”) and shall be
submitted along with the applicable permit to the approving department for
review. The Landscape Administrator may not require a landscape plan prepared
by an RLA for new development or sites less than one acre in area. No required
permits shall be issued for building, paving, or construction until a landscape
plan has been reviewed and approved by the Landscape Administrator. Prior to
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building or structure, all
screening and landscaping shall be constructed or installed in accordance with
an approved landscape plan.
   (E)   Enforcement. If at any time after the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy or other license or permit required by the city, that the constructed
or installed landscaping does not conform to the provisions of this section,
then the Director of Regulatory Compliance, or their designee, will issue
notice to the property owner, the authorized representative of the property
owner, or the tenant, describing the nature of the violation and identifying
the action(s) required to fully comply with the provisions of this section. If
the landscaping is not installed or replaced as directed, the property owner,
the authorized representative of the property owner, or the tenant shall be in
violation of the provisions of this section. Violations of this section shall
be punished in accordance with §
10.99 of the Code of Mansfield, Texas.
   (F)   Security. Landscaping shall not impede the ability of pedestrians to
look out, over, or into public areas (i.e., natural surveillance). Property
owners and developers and their RLAs are encouraged to utilize the basic
concepts of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (“CPTED”) when
preparing landscape plans. The Landscape Administrator may consider basic
concepts of CPTED as alternatives to landscape plant locations where security
issues may be presented.
   (G)   General standards. The following criteria and standards shall apply to
all landscaping, landscape materials, and their construction and installation,
in all zoning districts:
      (1)   All projects shall be sensitive to natural surroundings. Site
designs shall minimize grading and follow the natural contours to the greatest
extent. Graded slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the
terrain.
      (2)   Landscape construction and installation shall be aesthetically
pleasing and be consistent with the following principles and techniques:

may review and approve an alternative type, location or configuration of buffer
yard or visual screening to avoid potential interference with public utilities
or flood water conveyance. The alternative recommendation shall meet the intent
of this section to screen or buffer uses. Wood fencing or chain link fencing
are not permitted alternatives. Preservation of existing natural areas and
vegetation may be considered as alternatives to separate incompatible land
uses.
      (5)   Trees, shrubs, and ground cover shall be planted in the buffer yard
by the developer or owner of the developing property according to the type of
buffer yard required.
      (6)   To determine the type of buffer yard and screening required, the
developer must know the zoning and proposed use of his property and the zoning
and existing use of any adjacent properties. The developer must first find
either the zoning or proposed use of the property being developed in the first
column of the table below, then look for the zoning or existing use of any
adjacent property in the top row of the table. The types of required buffer
yards and required screening are listed horizontally across from the proposed
use or zoning of the property being developed and under the corresponding
column heading depicting the zoning or existing use of the adjacent properties.
      (7)   Types of required buffer yards and screening:

required herein shall be equal to or greater than the height of the HVAC units,
meters, transformers, and other utility units; trash containers, refuse or
recycling storage facilities; pool equipment, or service areas required to be
visually screened.
      (4)   Unless specified otherwise, the above screening shrubs shall be a
minimum of two feet in height at the time of planting and not of a dwarf
variety.
   (BB)   Residential lawn requirements.
      (1)   In the PR, SF, 2F, D, S, and PD Districts, the front, side and rear
yards adjacent to a single family residential dwelling (detached), that is

underground irrigation system as specified in this section. On large lots, the
area of irrigation may be limited to 12,000 square feet, subject to approval by
the Landscape Administrator.
   (CC)   Preservation credits.
      (1)   The following preservation credits shall be considered when
developing around existing quality trees.
      (2)   Quality trees preserved on a site meeting the herein specifications
may be credited toward meeting the tree requirement of any landscaping
provision of this section for that area within which they are located,
according to the following table:
 
Diameter (DBH) of Existing Tree Credit against Tree Requirement
6" to 8"                        2 trees
9" to 15"                       3 trees
16" to 30"                      4 trees
31" to 46"                      5 trees
47" or more                     8 trees
 
      (3)   For purposes of this section, the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)
dimension shall be measured at four and one-half feet above the ground and
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
      (4)   Existing trees, not on the approved tree list, may receive credit
if authorized by the Landscape Administrator.
      (5)   Credit will be revoked where trees intended for preservation
credits are damaged due to, among other things, construction, broken branches,
and soil compaction or soil cut/fill.
      (6)   To receive credit for existing trees in a parking area, the island
or area around the trunk of the tree must be enlarged and sized properly to
ensure the best scenario for survival.
      (7)   Prior to any construction or land development, the developer shall
clearly mark all trees to be preserved. Protective barriers shall be installed
and maintained throughout the development process. The developer shall not
allow the movement of heavy equipment or the storage of equipment, materials,
debris, or fill to be placed within the drip line of any trees. This is not
intended to prohibit the normal construction required within parking lots.
      (8)   During construction, the developer shall not allow cleaning of
equipment or material under the canopy of any existing tree or group of trees.
There shall be no disposal of any waste material such as, but not limited to,
paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, and the like under the canopy
of any existing tree or group of trees.
      (9)   No attachment or wires of any kind, other than those of a
protective nature, shall be attached to any tree.
      (10)   If any tree that was preserved and used as a credit toward
landscaping requirements is later removed for any reason, it shall be replaced
by the number of trees for which it was originally credited. Replacement trees
shall have a minimum trunk caliper of three inches.

compressor.
      (11)   Time limits.
         (a)   A specific use permit issued under this section shall expire as
to each drill site, operation site or line compressor facility authorized by
the specific use permit, and a new specific use permit shall be required
approving each unused drill site, operation site or line compressor facility if
two years have elapsed since the approval of the specific use permit and at the
time of the proposed use an unused drill site, operation site or line
compressor facility would no longer comply with the setback limitations set
forth in division (E) of this section.
         (b)   The authorization for gas well drilling and production
activities under a specific use permit issued under this section shall be valid
for a period of five years from the date of issuance and shall expire for any
surface activity, including, but not limited to, the drilling, fracturing and
completion of wells or the installation of new equipment, that is not completed
within said five year period, unless an extension of time is approved by the
City Council in accordance with the following procedure:
            1.   An operator of an existing drill site or operation site
seeking an extension of time shall submit an application for a new specific use
permit in accordance with §
155.080, including a site plan and any other required documentation.

requirements of division (E) of this section. An applicant may appeal such
decision to the City Council.
            4.   The City Council may grant additional extensions of time, not
to exceed five years in duration per request. Additional extensions of time may

            5.   Notwithstanding the foregoing division 4., the operator of an
existing drill site or operation site shall be entitled to make an application
for an extension of time regardless of the expiration of the preceding specific
use permit, provided that the application is made prior to April 28, 2016. Any
application received after April 28, 2016, shall conform to division 4. above.
            6.   If the application for the new specific use permit is approved
by the City Council, the operator shall conduct all gas well drilling and
production activities in compliance with the regulations in
Chapter 114 of this code and all other applicable city ordinances, and any
amendments thereof.
         (c)   A specific use permit issued for the activities regulated by
this section shall not be subject to expiration pursuant to §
155.080(H).
         (d)   An approved specific use permit shall expire for each drill site
operation site or line compressor facility that is used and then abandoned. A
drill site, operation site, or line compressor facility that is used will be
deemed abandoned once the use thereafter ceases for at least 12 consecutive
months. Intent to abandon shall be irrelevant.
   (C)   Line compressors.
      (1)   A specific use permit is required for the establishment and
operation of a line compressor and its related facilities and equipment whether
in conjunction with a gas well or as an independent operation, in accordance
with §
155.080.
      (2)   A site plan is required with the specific use permit application
and must include all applicable information required by §
155.080(C). The site plan must identify the location of the proposed line
compressor and provide a layout of the site showing all related facilities and
equipment. If the compressor is established separately from a drill site or
operation site, a video documenting the existing conditions where the
compressor is to be located shall also be required.
   (D)   Efficient use of surface. It is the intent of this section to
encourage efficient surface land use by requiring compact and centrally located
gas well development that minimizes the total amount of surface area needed for
gas well facilities and avoids the creation of unusable strips and parcels. In
order to implement this requirement, each operator shall, to the extent
permitted by Railroad Commission spacing rules, strive to locate new drill
sites in close proximity to pre-established drill and/or operation sites, if
located within 600 feet of the proposed new site. This requirement shall apply
regardless of whether the pre-established drill and/or operation sites are
owned or managed by a different operator.
   (E)   Required setback.
      (1)   No drill site or line compressor facility shall be permitted within
600 feet of the boundary of any preliminary or final platted residential
subdivision, except under one of the following conditions:
         (a)   A drill site or line compressor facility shall be permitted as
close as 300 feet to any boundary line of a platted subdivision if all affected
property owners within 600 feet of the drill site or line compressor facility
consent in writing; or
         (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a drill site or line compressor
facility may be located on a lot within the boundaries of a preliminary or
final platted residential subdivision with the written consent of the property
owner, provided the drill site or line compressor facility is located at least
300 feet from the boundary of any final platted residential lot within the
subdivision and the required distances set forth in divisions (2) and (3) below
are adhered to in accordance with their terms.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (a) above, "affected property owner"
shall mean the owner of property that is both within 600 feet of the proposed
drill site or line compressor facility and located within the boundary of a
preliminary or final platted residential subdivision.
      (2)   No drill site or line compressor facility shall be permitted within
600 feet of the boundary line of a property with a residential structure (if
located on an unplatted tract), public building, institution, public or private
school, day care center, or commercial building, except under one of the
following conditions:
         (a)   A drill site or line compressor facility shall be permitted as
close as 300 feet to any boundary line of a property described in division (2)
above if all affected property owners within 600 feet of the drill site or line
compressor facility consent in writing; or
         (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a drill site or line compressor
facility may be located on a property containing a residential structure (if
located on an unplatted tract), public building, institution, public or private
school, day care center, or commercial building with the written consent of the
property owner and the required distances set forth in divisions (E)(1) and (3)
are adhered to in accordance with their terms.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (a) above, "affected property owner"
shall mean the owner of property that is both within 600 feet of the proposed
drill site or line compressor facility and contains a building or structure
described in division (2) above.
      (3)   No drill site or line compressor facility shall be permitted within
1,000 feet from any hospital, nursing home, or the city's Law Enforcement
Center. For the purposes of this section, "nursing home" means a place for the
care of individuals who, because of injury, incapacity, age or infirmity are
generally non-ambulatory and require twenty-four hour supervised personal and/
or medical care.
      (4)   No well or line compressor may be located within 100 feet of a
railroad right-of-way.
      (5)   In addition to obtaining written permission from property owners in
accordance with divisions (E)(1)(a) or (E)(2)(a) above, a gas well operator
shall give written notice, in a form acceptable to the city, to the tenants or
lessees of any residential protected use or the owner of a residential
structure such as a manufactured home on a rental property within 600 feet of
the proposed drill site for which the operator is making an application for a
specific use permit. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail, return
receipt requested, and by first class U.S. mail. The operator shall provide
copies of the return receipts and an affidavit certifying that notice has been
sent to the above-referenced tenants or lessees.

(Ord. 671, passed 4-15-86)
§ 155.113 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Membership, appointment and term of office. There shall be a Board of
Adjustments composed of five regular members and up to three alternate members
who serve in the absence of one or more regular members. The members of the
Board shall be residents and real property taxpayers in the city, appointed by
the City Council for a term of two years or until their successors are
appointed. Four members of the Board shall be so appointed each odd-numbered
year and four members shall be appointed each even-numbered year. The City
Council may remove a Board member for cause, as found by the City Council, on a
written charge after a public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired term of any member whose position becomes vacant for any cause in the
same manner as the original appointment was made. Members of the Board shall
serve without compensation.
   (B)   Proceedings. The Board of Adjustments shall adopt rules to govern its
proceedings provided, however, that such rules are not inconsistent with this
chapter or statutes of the State of Texas. Meetings of the Board shall be held
at the call of the Chairman or at such other times as the Board may determine.
The Chairman, or in his absence, the Acting Chairman, may administer oaths and
compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open to
the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicate such
fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions,
all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be
a public record.
   (C)   Appeal process.
      (1)   Appeals to the Board can be taken by any person aggrieved by an
officer, department, or board or bureau of the municipality affected by any
decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 15
days after the decision has been rendered by the administrative officer, by
filing with the Officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board, a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken.
      (2)   At a public hearing relative to any appeal or variance, any
interested party may appear in person or by agent of attorney. The burden of
proof shall be on the applicant to establish the necessary facts to warrant
favorable action of the Board of Adjustments on any appeal.
   (D)   Stay of proceeding. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal
is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustments, after the notice of appeal
shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise, than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown.
   (E)   General powers. The Board shall have the following powers.
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of this chapter. The Board must find the following
in order to grant an appeal:
         (a)   That there is a reasonable difference of interpretation as to
the specific intent of the zoning regulations or zoning map.
         (b)   That the resulting interpretation will not grant a special
privilege to one property inconsistent with other properties or uses similarly
situated.
         (c)   The decision of the Board must be such as will be in the best
interest of the community and consistent with the spirit and interest of this
chapter.
      (2)   To initiate, on its motion or otherwise, action to bring about the
vacation and demolition of a nonconforming structure which is deemed to be
obsolete, dilapidated or substandard or the discontinuance of a non-conforming
use under any plan whereby full value of the structure or use can be amortized
within a definite period of time, taking into consideration the general
character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to conform to
the regulations of this chapter.
      (3)   To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of said
law will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the
ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. The term "variance"
shall mean a deviation from the literal provisions of the zoning ordinance
which is granted by the Board when strict conformity to the zoning ordinance
would cause an unnecessary hardship because of circumstances unique to the
property on which the variance is granted. Except as otherwise prohibited under
division (F) hereto, the Board is empowered to authorize a variance from a
requirement of the zoning ordinance when the Board finds that all of the
following conditions have been met:
         (a)   That the granting of the variance will not be contrary to the
public interest; and
         (b)   That literal enforcement of the ordinance will result in
unnecessary hardship because of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape,
topography or other extraordinary or exceptional physical situation or physical
condition unique to the specific piece of property in question. "Unnecessary
hardship" shall mean physical hardship relating to the property itself as
distinguished from a hardship relating to convenience, financial considerations
or caprice, and the hardship must not result from the applicant or property
owner's own actions; and
         (c)   That by granting the variance, the spirit of the ordinance will
be observed and substantial justice will be done. The applicant shall have the
burden of proving to the Board that the foregoing conditions have been met.
      (4)   To authorize special exceptions as specified in §
155.082.
   (F)   Use variance prohibited. No variance shall be granted to permit a use
in a zoning district in which that use is prohibited, or a use which is
explicitly prohibited by this chapter.
   (G)   Additional conditions. The Board is empowered to impose upon any
variance any condition reasonably necessary to protect the public interest and
community welfare.
   (H)   Revocation or modification. A variance or special exception may be
revoked or modified for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   That the variance or special exception was obtained or extended by
fraud or deception.
      (2)   That one or more of the conditions imposed by the Board in granting
such variance or special exception has not been complied with or has been
violated.
      (3)   That the variance or special exception although granted in
accordance with all requirements hereof, has caused a nuisance or is otherwise
detrimental to public health, safety and welfare.
      (4)   An action to revoke or modify a previously granted variance or
special exception may be initiated by order of the Board, or the person who
obtained the variance or special exception.
      (5)   The Board of Adjustments shall hear a request for the revocation or
modification of a variance or special exception in accordance with the same
notification and hearing procedures established for the original variances or
special exception.
   (I)   Notification and public hearing process. Any request for an appeal,
variance or special exception shall require a public hearing before the Board.
Notice of said public hearing shall be published at least one time in a
newspaper of the City of Mansfield, at least ten days prior to the date of the
hearing. A written notice of the hearing shall be sent to owners of property
situated within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the property with respect
to which such appeal or variance is requested at least ten (10) days prior to
the date of the hearing. It shall be sufficient that such written notice is
addressed to the owner appearing on the last approved tax roll of the city and
addressed to such owner at the address stated on said roll. If no owner is
stated on the tax roll or no address appears thereon, the written notice to
such property owner shall not be required. An application fee as set forth in
the fee schedule ordinance shall be paid to the city in advance of the hearing
except as indicated in §
155.082. No refund shall be made under any circumstances except in the event
the application is withdrawn prior to the mailing of the required written
notification or publication in the official newspaper, the fee shall be
refunded.
   (J)   Action of the Board. The concurring vote of four members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination
of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on
any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to
effect any variation in such ordinance.
   (K)   Appeal from decision of Board. Any person aggrieved by any decision of
the Board of Adjustment, or any officer, department or other board or
commission of the city or of the City Council, may appeal the decision or
action of the Board of Adjustments by filing a petition for same in a court of
competent jurisdiction, setting forth that such decision is illegal in whole or
in part, and specifying the grounds for the alleged illegality. Such petition
shall be filed with the court within ten days from the day the Board renders
its decisions, and not thereafter. The time period set forth herein shall be
deemed jurisdictional.
   (L)   Reapplication. No application for a variance or appeal which has been
denied shall be again filed earlier than one year from the date of original
denial unless other property in the immediate vicinity has, within the said one
year period, been changed or acted on by the Board of Adjustments or City
Council as to alter the facts and conditions on which the previous Board action
was based. Such change of circumstances shall permit the rehearing of an appeal
by the Board of Adjustments prior to the expiration of the one year period, but
such conditions shall in no wise have any force in law to compel the Board of
Adjustments, after a hearing, to grant a subsequent appeal. Such subsequent
appeal shall be considered entirely on its merits and the peculiar and specific
conditions related to the property on which the appeal is brought.
(Ord. 671, passed 4-15-86)

(Ord. 671, passed 4-15-86)
§ 155.115 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Authority to amend. The City Council may, from time to time, on its
own motion, or on petition of an interested property owner or owners:
      (1)   Amend, supplement, or change by ordinance the zoning classification
of any property or the regulations herein established or issue or revoke
specific use permits; or
      (2)   Issue or revoke specific use permits, following the receipt of a
report from the Planning and Zoning Commission on any application for a
specific use permit, the Council may:
         (a)   Authorize the issuance of the permit.
         (b)   Attach conditions relating to use limits, duration of the
permit, time of operation, or other appropriate conditions to the proposed
permit and then authorize its issuance.
         (c)   If the Council approves a specific use permit that authorizes
specialized construction of improvements that may only be utilized under the
terms of the specific use permit, the Council will not consider revocation of
the permit unless evidence is presented showing that the property owner/
operator is in direct and knowing violation of a specific performance condition
attached to the specific use permit when issued.
         (d)   The Council may consider the revocation of any specific use
permit if after a properly noticed hearing in which any interested party has an
opportunity to present evidence and be heard, the Council makes a determination
that a performance condition attached to the original permit has been violated
by the owner/operator of the permitted activity, or if the original permit was
issued with an expressly stated condition that the permit was for a limited
period of time and was subject to periodic review to determine impact on
adjoining properties or activities. If a permit is issued for a limited
duration, the applicant undertakes the permitted activity with the knowledge
that the permit may be revoked or not renewed by future Council action.
         (e)   Specific use permits issued for a limited time duration may be
extended for additional increments of time following a properly noticed
hearing.
         (f)   All specific use permits shall be approved, conditioned,
modified or revoked following a public hearing in a single meeting action of
the City Council. Specific use permits do not constitute a change in zoning
and, therefore, do not proceed through a three reading ordinance amendment
requirement as would be required for a change in zoning classification.
   (B)   Recommendation by Planning and Zoning Commission. Before taking any
action on any proposed amendment, supplements, change or a specific use permit,
the City Council shall submit the same to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for its recommendation and report. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
hold a public hearing before submitting its recommendation and report to the
City Council.
   (C)   Public hearing and notification requirements. No regulation,
restriction or zoning district classification of any property shall be amended,
supplemented or changed and no specific use permit approved or revoked until
after public hearings in relation thereto are held by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council, at which parties in interest and citizens shall
have an opportunity to be heard. Written notice of all public hearings before
the Planning and Zoning Commission on proposed changes in zoning district
classification or specific use permits shall be sent to owners of real property
lying within 200 feet of the property on which the change in classification or
specific use permit is proposed, such notice to be given, not less than ten
days before the date set for hearing, to all such owners who have rendered
their said property for city taxes as the ownership appears on the last
approved city tax roll. Such notice may be served by depositing the same,
properly addressed and postage paid, with the United States Postal Service. At
least 15 days notice shall be published in an official paper, or a paper of
general circulation in the City of Mansfield before the City Council public
hearing.
   (D)   Application fee. Any person, firm or corporation applying for a change
in this chapter or the zoning district classification of any property or a
specific use permit shall be required to pay an application processing fee as
set forth in the Mansfield fee schedule ordinance. No part of this fee shall be
refundable unless the application is withdrawn prior to the mailing of the
required written notification or publication in a newspaper. The limitation in
reference to giving of notice is to protect owners of nearby properties against
insincere applicants simply using the city's notice procedure to test public
reaction. No harm is done in terms of public image if case is withdrawn prior
to giving of public notice.
   (E)   Limitation of re-applications. No application for a change in zoning
districts or specific use permit shall be heard for a particular parcel of
property if within 12 months prior to the date of said application either a
zoning case was denied by the City Council or a zoning case was withdrawn after
the giving of public notice, and such application currently under consideration
includes property which was all or a part of the previously denied or withdrawn
case, and the application currently under consideration is for the same or a
more intense zoning district than provided, however, on receipt of written
request by the original applicant stating how conditions have changed
substantially in the community since prior consideration of his proposal so as
to justify an earlier review of this matter, the City Council may waive the
mandatory delay period and authorize the acceptance of a new application. The
term "more intense zoning district" shall mean one that generally permits uses
of higher intensity, progressing from the first district listed in §
155.021 as the least intense to the I-2, Heavy Industrial District as the most
intense, in the order listed in §
155.021.
   (F)   Postponement of public hearings at applicant's request. An applicant
for a zoning change or specific use permit may request a postponement of a
scheduled public hearing on such zoning request not less than ten days,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, prior to such scheduled public
hearing. In the event that any publication or notification has been made by the
city of the public hearing prior to such request for postponement, such
applicant shall include, with his request, payment to the City of Mansfield of
such fee for such postponement as may be set by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or City Council.
   (G)   Zoning districts not available for application. The city will not
accept any application for zoning change to the SF-5AC/24, SF-8.4/16, SF-7.5/
16, SF-7.5/12 or SF-6/12 District.
(Ord. 671, passed 4-15-86)

Planning and Development Director or his designee shall serve as Local Historic
Preservation officer. The Historic Landmark Commission shall meet regularly and
shall designate the time and place of its meetings. It shall adopt its own
rules of procedure and keep a record of its proceedings in accordance with the
State Statutes and the zoning ordinance and the Charter of the City of
Mansfield. Newly appointed members shall be installed at the first regular
meeting after their appointment.
   (C)   Meetings and quorum. Three members of the Historic Landmark Commission
shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business; however, three
affirmative votes shall be required to decide any issue before the Historic
Landmark Commission. The members shall regularly attend meetings and public
hearings of the Historic Landmark Commission and shall serve without
compensation, except for reimbursement for authorized expenses attendant to the
performance of their duties.
   (D)   Powers and duties. The Historic Landmark Commission shall thoroughly
familiarize itself with the buildings, land, areas and districts within the

   (E)   The preservation plan shall be presented to the City Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   (F)   The Historic Landmark Commission shall recommend to the City Planning
and Zoning Commission that certain buildings, land areas, and districts in the
city be designated as historic landmarks. Each recommendation shall include:
      (1)   Those premises, lots, or tracts to be designated;
      (2)   Any additional uses to be permitted in the specific "H" Historic
Landmark Overlay District; and
      (3)   Specific criteria for the required preservation of the exteriors of
the premises within the designated sub-district.
   (G)   If the Historic Landmark Commission finds that certain buildings,
land, areas or districts cannot be preserved without acquisition, the
Commission shall recommend to the City Planning and Zoning Commission that the
fee or a lesser interest in the property be acquired by gift, or purchase,
using funds available for preservation or restoration.
   (H)   Where there are conditions under which the required preservation of an
historic landmark would cause undue hardship to the owner or owners, use
changes may be recommended by the Commission. Such changes shall be in keeping
with the spirit and intent of §
155.069.
   (I)   Periodically the Commission shall review the status of designated
Historic Landmark Overlay Districts and include in the Commission's minutes a
report of such review.
   (J)   The designation of a Historic Landmark Overlay District may be amended
or removed using the procedure provided in §
155.069(L).
(Ord. 671, passed 4-15-86)
§ 155.117 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

construed as repealing any existing ordinance of the City of Mansfield
regulating nuisances or permitting uses which are not prohibited by this
chapter.
   (B)   Deed restriction. No provision or application of this chapter shall be
construed as affecting in any manner the rights of individual property owners

   This chapter shall be known and cited as the Park Land Dedication and
Development Fee Chapter.
(Ord. 1421, passed 4-14-03; Am. Ord. OR-2227-21, passed 11-8-21)
§ 156.02 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted to provide adequate recreational areas and
amenities in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of subdivision
development in the city and to make the park land dedication and park
development fee requirements an integral part of the review and approval of
residential developments, whether the developments consist of new construction
on previously vacant land or rebuilding and redeveloping existing residential
areas.
   (B)   New developments or redevelopments that involve only the replacement
or reconstruction of pre-existing dwelling units shall be exempt from the
provisions of this chapter, provided that the developments do not increase the
density of the preexisting dwelling units or involve a replat of the property.
   (C)   Neighborhood parks are those parks that provide a variety of outdoor,
recreational facilities and within convenient distances from a majority of the
residences to be served by such parks, the standards for which are set forth in
the Parks Master Plan.
   (D)   The park quadrants established by the Department and shown in the
Parks Master Plan, and as attached in Exhibit “A” to Ord. OR-2227-21, shall be
prima facie evidence that any park located therein is within a convenient
distance from the majority of residences to be served thereby. The cost of the
neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners
who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the
primary beneficiaries of such parks.
   (E)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the corporate limits as
well as to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city as a portion of the
subdivision regulation process.
   (F)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to properties that are
included in a valid preliminary or final plat application that was submitted
before the effective date of this chapter.
(Ord. 1421, passed 4-14-03; Am. Ord. OR-2227-21, passed 11-8-21)
§ 156.03 PARK LAND DEDICATION.
   (A)   The city has adopted by City Council action the Parks Master Plan,
which provides planning policy and guidance for the development of a municipal
park and recreation system for the city. The plan has assessed the need for
park land and park improvements to serve the citizens of Mansfield. The plan
has carefully assessed the impact on the park and recreation system created by
each new development and has established a dedication and/or cost requirement
based upon individual dwelling units. The plan constitutes an individualized
fact based determination of the impact of new living units on the park and
recreation system and establishes an exaction system designed to ensure that
new living units bear their proportional share of the cost of providing park
and recreation related services. Park land dedication requirements and park
development fee assessments are based upon the mathematical formulas and
allocations set forth within the plan. A summary table of the dedication and
cost requirements is set forth in a park land dedication table attached to Ord.
OR-2333-23 and incorporated herein for all purposes as attached in Exhibit “B”
to Ord. OR-2333-23, and as hereafter amended from time to time by City Council.
   (B)   When developing residential properties, the owner or developer shall
be responsible for a fee simple dedication of park land for each proposed
dwelling unit in an amount established by the park land dedication table
referenced in division (A) above and attached to Ord. OR-2333-23 as Exhibit
“B.”
   (C)   Any proposed plat submitted to the city for approval shall show the
area required to be dedicated under this section. In the event a plat is not
required, the dedication of land required under this section shall be conveyed
to the city through a warranty deed and approved by the city as to form and
substance prior to the issuance of a building permit.
   (D)   Each corner of the park land dedication shall have an iron rod or pin
set in accordance with other lot corners in the subdivision. In the absence of
a plat, the location of iron rods or pins set for corners shall be identified
on a recordable land survey completed by a land surveyor registered in the
State of Texas, provided to the city by the developer, and approved by the city
as to form and substance.
   (E)   The owner or developer shall meet with the Director of Parks and
Recreation or his/her designee (hereinafter referred to the “Director”) to
ensure compliance with the requirements in this section prior to platting. An
application for plat approval shall not be accepted unless it is accompanied by
written review comments from the Director.
   (F)   The City Council and the Mansfield Park Facilities Development
Corporation generally consider that development of an area less than five acres
for neighborhood park purposes may be inefficient for public maintenance.
Therefore, if fewer than five acres are proposed as park land dedication, the
Director shall have the option to:
      (1)   Accept the land dedication;
      (2)   Require the developer to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land
amount as provided in §
156.05 below; or
      (3)   Reject the land dedication and grant credit for a private park as
provided in §
156.07.
   (G)   The Director, prior to plat submittal, will define the optimum
location of the required park land dedication based upon the proposed park
being located adjacent to current or future park land and based on the Parks
Master Plan. If there is not an opportunity for the proposed park land
dedication to be adjacent to current or future park land, then the Director and
Developer will work together to define an optimum location for the park land
dedication. If an optimum location cannot be determined, then the Director
shall accept the cash in lieu of land option as outlined in §
156.05.
   (H)   In the case of a multi-phase development, if the developer dedicates
all the park land required by this chapter in the first or early phase(s) of
the development, no additional park land dedication will be required in later
phases unless additional lots that are not shown in the original preliminary
plat are included in the later phases of the development.
   (I)   Unless approved by the Director, no construction materials shall be
disposed of or deposited within the dedicated park land by the developer or its
contractors, subcontractors, employees, or agents at any time while the
subdivision is being built. If materials are deposited or disposed of within
the park, the developer shall remove such materials within 72 hours of written
notice by the city. If the developer fails to remove the materials after
notice, the city may do so at the developer's expense and no building permits
shall be issued for the subdivision(s) until that debt is paid to the city by
the developer.
(Ord. 1421, passed 4-14-03; Am. Ord. OR-2227-21, passed 11-8-21; Am. Ord. OR-
2333-23, passed 12-11-23)
§ 156.04 PARK LAND DEDICATION ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA.
   (A)   Land dedicated for a park or recreational area shall be of such size,
dimensions, topography, and general character as is reasonably required by the
city for the type of use necessary to meet the demand and need of future
residents. Recreational needs for which land is dedicated must include
multipurpose trails, open space buffer areas, active recreation for team or
individual sports, playgrounds with unitary rubber surfacing, picnic areas with
grills, pavilions and similar uses. Swimming pools or aquatic facilities do not
meet the criteria for neighborhood parks.
   (B)   Rare, unique, endangered, historic or other significant natural areas
will be given a high priority for dedication pursuant to this chapter. Areas
that provide an opportunity for linkages between parks or that preserve the
natural character of the surrounding environment may be required by the city to
be included in the park land dedication.
   (C)   The city shall not accept land dedication pursuant to this chapter if
it is subject to one or more of the following disqualifications unless
individually and expressly approved by the Director:
      (1)   Land within floodplain and floodway designated areas, based upon
100-year floodplains as defined by the Mansfield Master Drainage Plans, unless
such land dedication contains an open area as part of the total park land
dedication property that is topographically suitable for the installation of
the park amenities as defined in §
156.04(A) and (B) for neighborhood parks. In cases where floodplain land or
property is proposed to be conveyed to satisfy the parkland requirements, a
credit may be given upon the following ratio: two acres of floodplain shall
equal one acre of non-floodplain land;
      (2)   Park land dedication sites which do not have ready access to public
streets;
      (3)   Park land dedication sites abutted by private properties on more
than two-thirds of the total boundary dimension of such site; or
      (4)   Areas encumbered by overhead utility lines or easements of any type
which might limit the opportunity for park and recreation development.
   (D)   The city will not accept park land dedication sites encumbered by
hazardous and or municipal waste materials or dump sites.
   (E)   If a developer proposes to dedicate land for park development purposes
pursuant to the terms, conditions and requirements of this chapter, he or she
shall permit the Director to make an onsite inspection of the property for the
purposes of determining site suitability and identification of any visual
hazards or impediments to park development and use. If the property owner has
any form of environmental assessment on the tract, a copy of that assessment
shall be provided to the Director. The Director may initiate and/or require the
developer to initiate specific environmental studies or assessments if the
visual inspection of the site gives rise to the belief that an environmental
problem may exist on the site. The Director may require the employment of those
consultants necessary to evaluate any environmental issues relating to the site
provided that the Director makes such determination in good faith. If an
environmental hazard is identified on the site, the developer must either
remove the hazard prior to its acceptance into the park and recreation system
of the city or pay the fee in §
156.05.
   (F)   The intention of this chapter is not to discourage the creation of
parks and amenities in subdivisions that will be maintained by homeowners’
associations.
(Ord. 1421, passed 4-14-03; Am. Ord. OR-2227-21, passed 11-8-21)
§ 156.05 CASH IN LIEU OF LAND.
   (A)   An owner or developer responsible for park land dedication under this
chapter may be required, at the Director's option, to meet the dedication
requirements in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land in the
amount set forth below. Such payment in lieu of land dedication shall be made
prior to filing the plat for record or prior to the issuance of a building
permit where a plat is not required. All funds collected pursuant to this
section shall be used solely for the acquisition or leasing of park land in the
park quadrant in which the subdivision or development is located.
   (B)   In instances where land is required to be dedicated, the Director
shall have the right to reject the park land dedication and require a cash
payment in lieu of land in the amount set forth below, if the Director
determines that:
      (1)   The park land dedication site is such a small area that it is
inefficient to maintain;
      (2)   Sufficient park area is already in the public domain for the park
quadrant where the proposed development is located, and the recreation needs of
the citizens will be better served by expanding or improving existing parks in
said park quadrant; or
      (3)   The development project is located within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the city and the Director determines that maintaining the park
land will be financially impractical.
   (C)   The city may from time to time acquire land for parks in or near an
area of actual or potential development. If the city does acquire park land in
a park quadrant, the city may require subsequent dedications within the
quadrant to be cash payments in lieu of dedication only in order to reimburse
the city for the costs of acquisition.
   (D)   The cash payment in lieu of land dedication shall be met by the
payment of a fee set from time to time by city ordinance sufficient to acquire
neighborhood park land. The cash payment shall be computed on the basis of the
fee per dwelling unit as set forth in the park land dedication table set forth
in Exhibit “B” attached to Ord. OR-2333-23 as referenced in §
156.03.
   (E)   A cash payment in lieu of land dedication, as set forth in this
section, does not relieve the owner or developer of the obligation to pay the
park development fee set forth in §
156.06. The cash payment in lieu of land dedication is in addition to the
required park development fee.
(Ord. 1421, passed 4-14-03; Am. Ord. OR-2227-21, passed 11-8-21; Am. Ord. OR-
2333-23, passed 12-11-23)
§ 156.06 PARK DEVELOPMENT FEE.
   (A)   In addition to the required dedication of land, as set forth above and
based upon the study referenced in §
156.03(A), the developer or his or her successor shall pay a park development
fee to the city as a condition to building permit issuance. However, for
developments in the extraterritorial jurisdiction that are not subject to
building permit requirement, the developer shall pay the park development fee
prior to the recording of the final plat at the county. The park development
fee shall be set from time to time by city ordinance and shall be sufficient to
provide for the development of amenities and improvements on dedicated
neighborhood park land in the park quadrant in which the subdivision or
development is located. The park development fee shall be calculated on the
basis of the fee per dwelling unit as set forth in the park land dedication
table as set forth in Exhibit “B” attached to Ord. OR-2333-23 as referenced in
§
156.03(A).
   (B)   In lieu of payment of the required park development fee, the
developer, with written approval of the Director prior to initiation of work,
may have the option to construct the neighborhood park and improvements. All
public park improvements shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in the
Parks Master Plan or amendment thereof. All development plans and
specifications for the construction of said park improvements shall meet the

for capital improvements on non-publicly accessible private park land if the
capital improvements:

level of service is not currently being met; and

amenities that meet the minimum design and construction standards as set forth
