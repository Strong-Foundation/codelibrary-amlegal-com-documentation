hereafter granted, such right shall be terminable at the same time and under
the same conditions as the original grant.
Section 7. Other Conditions
   All franchises heretofore granted are recognized as contracts between the
City of Pleasanton and the grantee, and the contractual rights as contained in
any such franchise shall not be impaired by the provisions of this Charter,
except that the power of the City of Pleasanton to exercise the right of
eminent domain in the acquisition of utility property is in all things
reserved, and except the general power of the city heretofore existing and
herein provided for to regulate the rates and services of a grantee which shall
include the right to require proper and adequate extension of the plant and
service and the maintenance of the plant and fixtures at the highest reasonable
standard of efficiency. Every public utility franchise hereafter granted shall
be held subject to all the terms and conditions contained in the various
sections of this Article whether or not such terms are specifically mentioned
in the franchise. Nothing in this Charter shall operate to limit in any way, as
specifically stated, the discretion of the City Council or electors of the City
in imposing terms and conditions as may be reasonable in connection with any
franchise grant.
Section 8. Accounts of Municipally-Owned Utilities
   Accounts shall be kept for each public utility owned or operated by the
city, in such a manner as to show the true and complete financial results of
such city ownership and operation, including all assets, appropriately
subdivided by classes, depreciation reserve, other reserves and surplus; also
revenues, operating expenses including depreciation, interest payments, rental
and other disposition of annual income. The accounts shall show the actual
capital cost to the city of each public utility owned, also the cost of all
extensions, additions and improvements, and the source of funds expended for
such capital purposes. They shall show as nearly as possible the cost of any
service furnished to or rendered by any such utility to any city or
governmental department. The City Council shall cause a semi-annual report to
be made by a qualified public accountant and shall publish such report showing
the financial results of such City ownership and operation, giving the
information specified in this section and such data as the City Council shall
deem expedient.
Section 9. Regulation of Rates and Services
   The City Council shall have the full power to regulate by ordinance the
rates and charges for utility and other services furnished by the city and by
public and private companies operating in the City of Pleasanton. Notice of any
proposed increase in utility rates and service costs shall be given the
residents of the city by publishing notice thereof one (1) time in the City's
official newspaper at least ten (10) days prior to the date of a public hearing
which shall be held on such proposal. The notice shall state the time and place
of the hearing, the name of the proponent and the type of utility or service
for which the rate increase is sought. The proponent shall pay the full cost of
such notice and a correct stenographic transcript of the hearing, which the
Council may at its discretion require be made. A copy of such transcript shall
be filed with the City Secretary and made available to any citizen upon receipt
and reasonable deposit to insure its safe return under such rules and
regulations as the City Council may prescribe. No notice need be given nor
public hearing had where the rate change is solely one of a rate reduction.
ARTICLE XIX. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1. Publicity of Records
   All records and accounts of every office, department or agency of the city
shall be open to inspection by any citizen, any representative of a citizens'
organization or any representative of the press at all reasonable times, except
where such information is deemed confidential by the Texas Open Records Act,
Article 6252-17a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes.
Section 2. Private Development
   The City Council shall never authorize the expenditure of public funds for
the development of a privately owned subdivision. In this section a subdivision
shall be deemed to be privately owned when the owner or owners, whether
individual, partnership, corporation or other body, shall have filed a plat as
required by this Charter, and shall have undertaken the sale of lots or parcels
from the platted area. The prohibition herein shall not apply to extension of
utilities or services to any incorporated area for the purpose of serving
existing houses, housing facilities or commercial buildings.
Section 3. Notice of Claim Against City for Damages
   Before the City of Pleasanton shall be liable for damages for personal
injuries to or destruction of property, the person, or the owner of the
property injured or destroyed, or someone in his or her behalf (or in the case
the injuries result in death, the person who may have a cause of action under
the law by reason of such death), shall give the City Secretary notice in
writing of such injury or destruction duly verified, within thirty (30) days
after the same has been sustained, stating in such written notice when, where
and how the injury or destruction occurred, and the apparent extent thereof,
the amount of damage sustained, the amount for which claimant will settle, the
actual residence of the claimant by street and number at the date the claim is
presented, and the actual residence of such claimant for six (6) months
immediately preceding the occurrence of such injuries or destruction, and the
names and addresses of the witnesses upon whom he or she relies to establish
his or her claim. A failure to so notify the City Secretary within the time and
manner specified herein shall exonerate, excuse and exempt the city from any
liability whatsoever. In the event a claim for injury or damages has been
processed and duly investigated by or on behalf of the insurance carrier with
whom the City carries the applicable insurance coverage, neither the City
Council nor any City official may overturn the final determination of the
insurance carrier.

spacing, completion and operation of oil, gas, and commercial, industrial, and
residential water wells within the territorial limits of the City of

   No person related within the second degree of affinity, or within the third
degree of consanguinity to any elected officer of the City, or to the City
Manager, shall be appointed to any office, position or clerkship or other
service of the city. This provision shall not apply, however, to any person who
shall have been employed by the city six months prior to and at the time of the
election of the Mayor or Councilmember, or appointment of the City Manager, so
related to him or her, in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.
Section 6. Public Library
   The City Council shall have the authority to establish and maintain a free
public library within the City and to cooperate with any person, firm,
association or corporation under such terms as the City Council may prescribe
for the establishment of such free public library. For budget purposes, the
library shall be considered as a department of the City and the appropriations
therefor shall comply with all the budgetary requirements as outlined in this
Charter and as may be prescribed from time to time by the City Council.
Section 7. Zoning Ordinances
   For the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, or general welfare
of the City, the Council may by ordinance regulate the location, height, bulk
and size of buildings and other structures, the size of yards, courts and other
open spaces, the density of population and the uses of buildings, structures
and land for trade, industry, business, residence or other purposes. Such
ordinances may provide that the zoning board of adjustment may, in appropriate
cases and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules, conditions and
safeguards set forth in the ordinances, make special exceptions to the terms of
the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent. Such
ordinances may provide that the zoning board of adjustment may authorize
variances from the strict application of the regulations in such situations and
subject to such limitations as may be set forth in ordinance. All of the powers
granted by Section 211.001-211.021, Local Government Code, Vernon's Texas Codes
Annotated, together with existing amendments and all amendments as hereinafter
may be made relating to zoning in cities, are hereby adopted and made a part of
this charter.
Section 8. Provisions Relating to Assignment, Execution, and Garnishment
   The property, real and personal, belonging to the city shall not be liable
to be sold or appropriated under any writ of execution of cost bill. The funds
belonging to the city, in the hands of any person, firm or corporation, shall
not be liable to garnishment, attachment, or sequestration; nor shall the city
be liable to garnishment on account of any debt it may owe or funds or property
it may have on hand or owing to any person. Neither the city nor any of its
officers or agents shall be required to answer any such writ of garnishment on
any account whatever. The city shall not be obligated to recognize any
assignment of wages or funds by its employees, agents or contractors.
Section 9. City Not Required to Give Security or Execute Bond
   It shall not be necessary in any action, suit or proceeding in which the
City of Pleasanton is a party, for any bond, undertaking or security to be
demanded or executed by or on behalf of said city in any of the state courts,
but in all such actions, suits, appeals or proceedings same shall be conducted
in the same manner as if such bond, undertaking or security had been given as
required by law, and said city shall be just as liable as if security or bond
had been duly executed.
Section 10. Effect of This Charter on Existing Law
   All ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations now in force under the
city government of Pleasanton and not in conflict with the provisions of this
Charter, shall remain in force under this Charter until altered, amended or
repealed by the Council after this Charter takes effect; and all rights of the
City of Pleasanton under existing franchises and contracts are preserved in
full force and effect to the City of Pleasanton.
Section 11. Interim Municipal Government
   a.   Upon the adoption of this Charter, those persons holding elective
offices shall continue to serve until the expiration of their present terms,
and thereafter shall be elected as provided in this Charter.
   b.   During such interim, persons, who on the date this Charter is adopted,
are employed or filling appointive positions with the City of Pleasanton which
are retained under this Charter, may continue to fill those positions for the
term for which they were employed or appointed.
   c.   All rights, claims, orders, contracts, and legal or administrative
proceedings shall continue except as modified pursuant to the provisions of
this Charter and in each case shall be maintained, carried on, or dealt with by
the city department, office, or agency appropriate under this Charter.
   d.   The budget in effect immediately preceding the adoption of this Charter
shall remain in effect for the balance of the fiscal year and until such time
as a new budget is adopted for the next succeeding year.
Section 12. Amending the Charter
   The Home Rule Charter of the City of Pleasanton, Texas shall be reviewed
every two (2) years by a Charter Review Committee. The Charter Review Committee
shall consist of seven (7) members, one (1) appointed by the Mayor, and the
other six (6) members are appointed by each Councilmember in office at that
time, from his or her district. Amendments to this Charter may still be framed
and submitted to the voters of the City in the manner provided in Section 9.004
of the Texas Local Government Code, as now or hereafter amended.
Section 13. Separability Clause
   If any section or part of section of this Charter shall be held invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the remainder of
this Charter nor the context in which such section or part of section so held
invalid may appear, except to the extent that an entire section or part of
section may be inseparably connected in meaning and effect with the section or
part of section to which such holding shall directly apply.
Section 14. Submission of Charter to Electors
   The Charter Commission in preparing this Charter finds and decides that it
is impracticable to segregate each subject so as to permit a vote of "yes" or
"no" on the same, for the reason that the Charter is so constructed that in
order to enable it to work and function it is necessary that it should be
adopted in its entirety. For these reasons, the Charter Commission directs that
the Charter be voted upon as a whole and that it shall be submitted to the
qualified voters of the City of Pleasanton at an election to be held for that
purpose. If a majority of the qualified electors voting in such election shall
vote in favor of the adoption of this Charter, it shall become the Charter of
the City of Pleasanton, and after the returns have been canvassed, the same
shall be declared adopted and the City Secretary shall file an official copy of
the Charter with the records of the city. The City Secretary shall furnish the
Mayor a copy of said Charter, which copy of the Charter so adopted,
authenticated and certified by his or her signature and the seal of the city,
shall be forwarded by the Mayor to the Secretary of State of the State of Texas
and shall show the approval of such Charter by majority vote of the qualified
electors voting at such election. In not less than thirty (30) days prior to
such election, the City Council shall cause the City Secretary to mail a copy
of this Charter to each qualified voter of the City of Pleasanton.

§ 31.01 INVESTMENT AUTHORITY AND SCOPE OF POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. To establish and provide specific policy direction and
investment guidelines for managing the investment program of the city.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of the City of Pleasanton, Texas (the "city") to
invest its funds in a manner, that provides for safety of principal while
pursuing the greatest reasonable market return given the cash flow needs of the
city. All funds will be invested in compliance with all state and local
statutes, and any related financial accounting standards.
      (2)   This policy satisfies the requirements of the Public Funds
Investment Act (PFIA), Tex. Gov’t. Code Ch. 2256.
   (C)   Scope.
      (1)   This investment policy shall apply to all the funds and investments
of the city as well as any other funds held in a custodial capacity by the
city. The only funds of the city exempt from this policy are the deferred
compensation and retirement system assets, which the city sets aside or holds
for its employees and are governed by separate individual agreements.
      (2)   All funds invested under this policy shall be administered as a
pooled group for investment purposes. The city's accounting procedures will
maintain the individual ownership of that pool in its various funds and
accounting records.
   (D)   Delegation of investment authority.
      (1)   The City Manager, Finance Director, and Assistant Finance Director
are hereby designated as investment officers for the city. The city may use
other employees or the services of a contractor to aid the investment officer
(s) in the execution of their duties. Otherwise, unless authorized by law, no
other individual(s) has the authority to deposit, withdraw, transfer, or manage
the investments of the city. The city may designate a registered investment
advisor to invest for the city and act as an additional investment officer.
Authority granted to a person(s) to deposit, withdraw, invest, transfer or
manage the city's investments is effective until rescinded by the City Council
or until termination of the person's employment or contract.
      (2)   The Finance Director is responsible for the management of the
investment program. The investment officers are responsible for the daily
operations of the investment function. The Finance Director shall be
responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of
controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials.
      (3)   The city may contract with a registered investment advisor for the
management of the city's portfolio. The advisor shall review the investment
policy and execute all transactions in accordance with the provisions and
controls of the investment policy.
   (E)   Ethics and conflicts of interest.
      (1)   Investment officers shall refrain from personal business activities
that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment program, or
which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.
      (2)   Investment officers who have a personal business relationship with
a business organization seeking to sell an investment to the city and/or who
have any family member related within the second degree to an individual
seeking to sell an investment to the city shall file a statement disclosing
that personal interest to the Finance Director, City Manager, the City Council
and the Texas Ethics Commission.
      (3)   An investment officer has a personal business relationship with a
business organization if:
         (a)   The investment officer owns 10% or more of the voting stock or
shares of the business organization or owns $5,000 or more of the fair market
value of the business organization;
         (b)   Funds received by the investment officer from the business
organization exceed 10% of the investment officer's gross income for the
previous year; or
         (c)   The investment officer has acquired from the business
organization during the previous year investments with a book value of $2,500
or more for the personal account of the investment officer.
(Ord. 24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)
§ 31.02 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY.
   (A)   Safety of principal. The primary objective of the city's investment
program is to ensure the safety of all funds. To attain this objective, it is
the city's intent to invest in the safest types of securities, to pre-qualify
broker/dealers and advisors, and to hold all investments until maturity in
order to ensure the return of all invested principal unless circumstances arise
as stipulated in § 31.04(I).
   (B)   Liquidity. The city's investment decisions will be made based on cash
flow analysis that provides the required liquidity necessary to pay the city's
expected obligations. Liquidity shall be achieved by matching investment
maturities with budgetary and economic cycles. A portion of the portfolio will
be maintained in liquid short-term investments that can be converted to cash if
necessary to meet disbursement requirements. Investment pools, money market
accounts, and no-load money market mutual funds provide daily liquidity and may
be utilized as a competitive yield alternative to fixed maturity investments.
   (C)   Diversification. The city shall diversify its portfolio to mitigate
the risk of loss resulting from over concentration of assets in a specific
maturity, a specific issuer, or a specific class of investments. See § 31.04(G)
for specific diversification requirements/limits on individual types of
investments.
   (D)   Yield. It will be the objective of the city to earn the greatest
reasonable market yield within the constraints imposed by its safety and
liquidity objectives, investment strategies, and state and federal law. Return
on investment is of secondary importance to safety and liquidity objectives.
The city elects to set a target benchmark to guide investment decisions, and
thus measure yield and the level of acceptable risk for the portfolio, at the
one-year treasury bill rate. The selected target benchmark reflects the city's
tolerance for risk as it pursues the greatest reasonable market yield.
   (E)   Maturity.
      (1)   The portfolio shall be structured primarily to meet city
obligations and secondly to achieve a reasonable return of interest as measured
against its benchmark in division (D) above. The maximum allowable stated
maturity of any individual investment owned by the city shall be five years
from date of purchase. The settlement date is considered the date of purchase.
However, the city may collateralize its demand deposit accounts, certificates
of deposits, and repurchase agreements using investments with a term not to
exceed 30 years.
      (2)   The maximum duration of the overall portfolio shall be no longer
than 30 months.
   (F)   Investment training. Investment officers shall pursue the mandatory
training required by the PFIA for municipal investment officers. Specifically,
they shall accumulate (a) ten hours of training within 12 months after taking
office or assuming duties and (b) not less than eight hours of training in a
two-year period that begins on the first day of the fiscal year and consists of
the two consecutive fiscal years after that date. Training shall include
education in investment controls, security risks, strategy risks, market risks,
diversification, and compliance. Training must be provided by an independent
source authorized by Texas statute. An external auditor shall review
documentation of training hours annually.
   (G)   Quality and capability of investment management. Investment officers
shall always be cognizant of the standard of care and the investment objectives
as set forth in the city's investment policy.
   (H)   Investment strategy. In accordance with the PFIA (Tex. Gov’t. Code §
2256.005(d)) a separate written investment strategy shall be developed for each
portfolio/fund or pooled group of funds under the city's control. The strategy
shall be reviewed on an annual basis with formal action by the City Council
stating that the strategy has been reviewed and recording any changes made.
   (I)   Cash management. Cash management is defined as the process of managing
monies to ensure the greatest amount of cash is available for active investment
by the city, thereby maximizing interest earnings, withing the constraints of
this policy. The city shall maintain a comprehensive cash management program
that includes collection of accounts receivable, prudent investment of its
available cash, disbursement of payments in accordance with invoice terms and
the management of banking services.
(Ord. 24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)
§ 31.03 AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS.
   (A)   Authorized investments. Authorized investments under this chapter

Gov’t. Code §§ 2256.016 and 2256.019) and approved by City Council resolution.
      (7)   AAA-rated, SEC registered no-load money market mutual funds and no-

   (B)   Certificates of deposit.
      (1)   Depository certificates of deposit (CD) may be purchased from any
financial institution with a main or branch office in the State of Texas. It is
not necessary for a Texas financial institution to be on the city's approved
broker/dealer list as CD's are considered depository in nature. However, all
agreements with the financial institution must be completed prior to the
purchase of a CD from the financial institution.
      (2)   Bids for CD's, whether purchased from a brokerage firm or a
financial institution, may be solicited orally, in writing, electronically or
by any combination of those methods.
      (3)   Amounts purchased over the FDIC or NCUA limit must be protected as
per § 31.07(A).

      (1)   Collateralized mortgage obligations;
      (2)   Commercial paper, excluding pools which invest in commercial paper;

market value of the pool; and
      (11)   Any other investments that are not specifically authorized within
this policy.
   (D)   Investments with required ratings. Investments with minimum required
ratings do not qualify as authorized investments during the period the
investment does not have the minimum rating. Investment ratings shall be
checked routinely by an investment officer to ensure that the ratings have not
been downgraded. The city shall take all prudent measures that are consistent
with its investment policy to liquidate investments that do not have the
minimum rating.
   (E)   Exemptions for existing investments. Any investment held in the city's
investment portfolio at the time of adoption of this policy that does not meet
the guidelines of this policy, but was an authorized investment at the time of
purchase, is not required to be immediately liquidated; however, the city shall
take all prudent measures consistent with this investment policy, to liquidate
an investment that no longer qualifies as an authorized investment.
(Ord. 24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)
§ 31.04 INVESTMENT CONTROLS.
   (A)   Selection of investment broker/dealers.
      (1)   The investment officers will maintain a list of broker/dealers and
local government investment pools authorized by the City Council to provide
investment services to the city. Annually, the City Council will approve the
list of broker/dealers authorized to conduct business with the city. Investment
officers shall not conduct business with any firm not approved by City Council.
      (2)   In accordance with the PFIA (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 2256.005(k)) a
written copy of the investment policy shall be presented to any business
organization offering to engage in an investment transaction with the city. The
PFIA defines "business organization" as an investment pool or investment
management firm under contract with an investing entity to invest or manage the
entity's investment portfolio. The investment pools and/or investment
management firms shall certify receipt of the investment policy by utilizing
Appendix A Certification by Business Organization or executing a written
instrument in a form acceptable to the city in accordance with the PFIA. A
written copy of the investment policy shall also be presented to all approved
broker/dealers. The PFIA does not require broker/dealers to certify receipt of
the city's investment policy; however, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
regulations require that registered broker/dealers receive a copy of a
customer's investment policy.
      (3)   All broker/dealers who desire to become qualified bidders for
investment services must fill out an application and return it to one of the
city's investment officers listed in the policy. After review of all
applicants, a list of selected broker/dealers will be prepared by the
investment officers and reviewed by the City Council. The following may be
required with the application: most recent audited financial statements, list
of local government clients, and statement of qualifications.
      (4)   Criteria used in the selection of the authorized broker/dealers
will include, but are not limited to, material litigation against the firm,
regulatory status of the dealer, completed packet, references from local
government clients, and background and expertise in the investment of public
funds.
      (5)   Up to five firms shall be selected to appear on the city's approved
list. If, after a firm is selected, they no longer qualify to appear on the
city's approved dealer list, or provide services inconsistent with acceptable
levels, the investment officers may recommend removal of the firm from the
approved list of broker/dealers to the City Council, along with recommending a
qualified replacement firm.
   (B)   Certification.
      (1)   A written copy of this investment policy shall be presented to any
investment pool or discretionary investment management firm seeking to engage
in a financial transaction with the city. The authorized representative of the
business organization shall execute a written instrument substantially in the
form found in Appendix A and to the effect that the representative has:
         (a)   Received and thoroughly reviewed the investment policy of the
city; and
         (b)   Acknowledged that the organization has implemented reasonable
procedures and controls to preclude investment transactions that are not
authorized by the city's investment policy except to the extent that the
authorization is dependent on an analysis of the makeup of the city's entire
portfolio, requires interpretation of subjective investment standards, or
relates to investment transactions of the city that are not made through
accounts or other contractual arrangements over which the business organization
has accepted discretionary investment authority.
      (2)   The investment officer(s) may not transact business with any firm
that has not executed and returned this certification in accordance with the
PFIA (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 2256.005(1)).
   (C)   Delivery vs. payment settlement. It shall be the policy of the city
that all securities shall be purchased on a delivery vs. payment (DVP) basis,
except for investment pools and mutual funds. By so doing, city funds are not
released until the city, or its approved custodian has received the securities
purchased or pledged.
   (D)   Internal control and annual audit. The Finance Director or designee
shall establish a system of internal controls. The controls shall be designed
to prevent losses of public funds arising from fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation of third parties, or imprudent actions by employees or
investment officers of the city. Controls and managerial emphasis deemed
important include the following:
      (1)   Safekeeping receipts and record management;
      (2)   Documentation of investment bidding;
      (3)   Written confirmations;
      (4)   Reconciliation and comparisons of security receipts with
investments and bank records;
      (5)   Compliance with investment policies;
      (6)   Accurate and timely reporting;
      (7)   Adequate training and development of investment officers;
      (8)   Control of collusion;
      (9)   Segregation of duties;
      (10)   Clear delegation of authority; and
      (11)   Staying informed about market conditions, changes and trends that
require adjustments in investment strategies
   (E)   Standard of care.
      (1)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under prevailing
circumstances, that a person of prudence, discretion, and intelligence would
exercise in the management of the person's own affairs, not for speculation,
but for investment, considering the probable safety of capital and the
anticipated income to be derived.
      (2)   In determining whether an investment officer has exercised prudence
with respect to an investment decision, the determination shall be made taking
into consideration:
         (a)   The investment of all funds over which the officer had
responsibility rather than a consideration as to the prudence of a single
investment; and
         (b)   Whether the investment decision was consistent with the city's
investment policy.
      (3)   The Finance Director and the other investment officers are not
personally responsible for changes in the market.
   (F)   Competitive bidding.
      (1)   The investment officer shall obtain competitive bids from at least
three brokers or financial institutions on all purchases and sales of
investment instruments transacted on the secondary market. The requirement for
competitive bids shall not apply to transactions with money market funds and
local government investment pools (which are deemed to be made at prevailing
market rates). In situations where the exact security being offered is not
offered by other dealers, offers on the closest comparable investment may be
used to establish a fair market price for the security. Quotes will be accepted
either written or electronically, or a combination thereof.
      (2)   The investment will be made with the broker/dealer offering the
optimum risk/return investment option to the city. If three bids/offers are
solicited but three responses are not received within the time frame specified
in the solicitation of the bid/offer, the investment officer may act based on
the responses received as long as the solicitation of and failure to receive
the bids/offers is documented. Any investments purchased must have the
signature of at least two investment officers.
   (G)   Portfolio diversification.
      (1)   The city will diversify its investments by security type and
institution, as appropriate for prudent risk management.
      (2)   With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities and interest-bearing
checking accounts that are fully collateralized, no more than 75% of the city's
total investment portfolio will be invested in a single security type. If the
city elects to participate in more than one investment pool, the total percent
invested in all pools shall not exceed the maximum percent allowed.
      (3)   Diversification requirements are as follows:
Investment type Maximum investment %
Investment type                Maximum investment %
Repurchase agreements          Up to 50%
Certificates of Deposit**      Up to 75%

   (H)   Electronic funds transfer. The city may use electronic means to
transfer or invest all funds collected or controlled by the city.
   (I)   Selling of securities before maturity. While it is the city's intent
to hold securities to maturity to ensure safety of principal, if the city
determines it is in its best interest to sell a security prior to maturity
(i.e., to meet disbursement needs or to take advantage of interest rates,
etc.), the City Manager and the Finance Director must both approve the sale of
the security. This may also occur associated with the downgrade of a security
which no longer meets the city's minimum rating requirements, if determined by
the City Manager and the Finance Director it is in the best interest of the
city to dispose prior to scheduled maturity.
(Ord. 24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)
§ 31.05 ARBITRAGE.
   (A)   Arbitrage rebate provisions require that the city compute earnings on
investments from each issue of tax-exempt bonds consistent with treasury
regulations to determine if a rebate liability exists, payable to the IRS. The
city is required to perform specific calculations relative to the actual
interest income earned on the investment of the funds and the income that could
have been earned if the funds had been invested at a rate equal to the yield on
the bonds sold by the city. The regulations require extreme precision in the
monitoring and recording facets of the investments as a whole, and particularly
as it relates to yields and computations to ensure compliance. Failure to
comply can dictate that the bonds become taxable, retroactively from the date
of issuance, or subject the city to severe penalties.
   (B)   The city's investment position as it relates to arbitrage regulations
is as follows: Investments of bond proceeds will be made with safety of
principal and liquidity in mind, but with a competitive rate of return. When
project timing and cash flows allow, bond proceeds may be invested in
instruments allowed under § 31.03 subject to any additional restrictions
imposed by the bonds issuing documents. All investments purchased with bond
funds shall be documented clearly and reported to the city's arbitrage
consultant for tracking and review. Arbitrage rebate calculations will be
performed as required by federal regulations on all tax-exempt debt issues.
Arbitrage calculated to be rebated to the IRS, will be paid as necessary.
(Ord. 24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)
§ 31.06 INVESTMENT REPORTING.
   (A)   The investment officers shall provide an investment report to the City
Council on no less than a quarterly basis in accordance with the PFIA (Tex.
Gov’t. Code § 2256.023). The report shall include a detailed listing of all
security purchases and sales, a description of each security held, interest
earnings for the period, as well as management summary information. A summary
statement indicating the investment portfolio is compliant with the investment
policy shall be included, or note any areas of noncompliance. Market prices
used to determine market value in the investment reports shall be obtained from
an independent source.
   (B)   The report must be prepared and signed by the Finance Director and
contain a statement of compliance with regard to the city's investment policy
and the PFIA (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 2256.023).
(Ord. 24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)
§ 31.07 INVESTMENT COLLATERAL AND SAFEKEEPING.
   (A)   Depository collateral pledged to the city.
      (1)   The investment officer(s) or investment advisor shall ensure that
time and demand deposits are insured or collateralized consistent with the Tex.
Gov’t. Code § 2257. The city chooses to accept the following as collateral
based on the list of investments authorized under the PFIA. Preference will be
given to pledged securities.
         (a)   Obligations of the U.S. Treasury;
         (b)   Obligations of any U.S. agency or instrumentality including
mortgage- backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations passing the
Federal Reserve's bank test;
         (c)   Bonds of any U.S. state or its subdivisions if rated A or better
by at least one nationally recognized rating agency; or
         (d)   FHLB letters of credit.
      (2)   The right of collateral substitution may be granted with the
approval of the Finance Director or other investment officers in the absence of
the Finance Director. The Finance Director or other investment officers in the
absence of the Finance Director must approve and release pledged collateral.
The bank is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the required 102% margin
daily. The city reserves the right to request additional collateral in the
event the investment officer(s) deems that deposits or investments are not
sufficiently protected by the pledged collateral.
      (3)   The market value of the pledged securities used as collateral will
be greater than or equal to 102% of the principal and accrued interest of all
deposits (less applicable FDIC insurance) and be held by an independent party
outside the holding company of the pledging bank approved by the city. Pledged
collateral will be evidenced by original safekeeping receipts and monthly
statements sent to the city.
      (4)   Irrevocable FHLB letters of credit (LOCs) must have a value of no
less than 102% of all principals and anticipated accrued interest (less
applicable FDIC insurance). The financial institution will be responsible for
monitoring and maintaining the 102% margin with the LOCs.
   (B)   Collateral owned by the city. Collateral underlying a repurchase
agreement is owned by the city through that buy/sell transaction. The
counterparty will be responsible for monitoring and maintaining the required
102% margin in market value daily. Collateral will be safekept at an
independent institution approved by the city.
   (C)   Custody of city owned security. Securities will be held by an
independent third-party custodian selected by the city, with all securities
held in an account in the name of the city. The custody institution shall
annually provide a copy of their most recent report on internal controls
(Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70, or SAS 70). Custody statements shall
be maintained by the Finance Director or other investment officers and shall be
available for review upon request.
(Ord. 24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)
§ 31.08 INVESTMENT POLICY ADOPTION.
   The city’s investment policy shall be adopted by ordinance annually by the
City Council. Any modifications made thereto must be approved by the City
Council and documented by ordinance.
(Ord.24-1349, passed 12-5-2024)

§ 32.01 PURPOSE AND GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   These policies and procedures are established in an effort to develop
and expand the local economy by promoting and encouraging development and
redevelopment projects that enhance the city's economic base and economic
diversity, and expand job opportunities. The goal and public purpose of a
program established pursuant to these policies and procedures is to promote
state or local economic development and to stimulate commercial activity in the
municipality.
   (B)   In furtherance of these objectives, the city will, on a case-by-case
basis, give consideration upon request to provide economic incentives to
applicants in accordance with these policies and procedures, as authorized by
Tex. Loc. Gov't Code, Ch. 380, as may be amended from time to time. These
policies and procedures are not intended to obligate the city to provide
economic incentives to any applicant. The decision whether to approve or deny
economic incentives for any applicant shall be at the discretion of the
Council; no program or agreement is effective unless and until it is approved
by the Council.
   (C)   Nothing in these policies and procedures, the application process, or
the negotiation process creates any property, contract or other legal right in
any person to have the Council consider or grant incentives. Nothing in these
policies and procedures, the application process or the negotiation process
creates any vested right in any person.
   (D)   A failure on the part of the city to strictly comply with these
policies and procedures shall not be the basis for invalidating a program or
agreement approved by the Council. These policies and procedures are intended
as guidelines for negotiation purposes.
   (E)   Chapter 380 of the Tex. Loc. Gov't Code does not define the term
"program." The city defines the term "program" to include any project that
receives incentives, singularly or in some combination, pursuant to Tex. Loc.
Gov't Code, Ch. 380 as embodied in an agreement between the city and applicant.
The term "program" includes these policies and procedures.

property taxes and/or increased sales and use tax (excluding inventory and

      (2)   Is determined by the City Council to bring benefit to the city in
that it will make a unique contribution to the development efforts in the city,
due to its magnitude, significance to the community or aesthetic quality; or
      (3)   Will result in increased jobs in the city.
   (B)   Incentives established under a program will be provided only to the
extent that the public benefit or amount of revenue realized by the city and
attributable to a program is commensurate with the value of any incentives
granted in the agreement.
(Ord. 20-1243, passed 4-16-2020)

      NPDES. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.
      POTW. Publicly owned treatment works.
      TCEQ. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
   (B)   Enforcement. Users who violate any term or condition of §
50.06, this section, or of their permit shall be subject to enforcement action
by the city hereinafter referred to as the control authority. Such enforcement
action will be applied in accordance with the enforcement response plan and may
include legal action or other appropriate enforcement remedies as provided for
below:
      (1)   Enforcement response plan. In accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5)
(ii), the control authority has in use an enforcement response plan (ERP),
including an enforcement response guide (ERG) which shall be used by the
control authority in initiating and, if necessary, in escalating, enforcement
responses with regard to any instance of user noncompliance. The ERP is subject
to change as required, and is consistent with approval authority procedures and
guidelines.
      (2)   Legal action. In addition to any other remedies provided by this
section, the control authority may, at any time, seek legal and/or equitable
remedies, or prosecute criminal charges against any person, corporation or
other entity believed to be in violation of this section, the provisions of an
industrial wastewater discharge permit and/or any federal or state law or
regulations governing water quality or industrial wastewater pretreatment over
which the control authority has been given enforcement powers. The control
authority legal staff is hereby authorized and instructed to commence such
actions for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in courts having proper
jurisdiction and may seek civil penalties and any other legal or equitable
relief available under common law, Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Chapter 54, or any
other applicable local, state, or federal code or statute. The control
authority may require that an enforcement meeting be held prior to implementing
legal action; however, such a meeting shall not be a bar against or
prerequisite for taking any enforcement action against the user.
      (3)   Notice of violation (NOV). When the control authority determines
that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
section, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may serve (either
personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested) upon
that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 working days of the mailing
date or personal delivery date of such notice, an explanation for the violation
and measures taken and/or to be taken for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the control authority. Submission of this response in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the control authority to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of
violation.
      (4)   Response by the industrial user to the notice of violation. The
industrial user responding to receipt of a notice of violation shall file a
written response in the following form:
         (a)   The industrial user shall submit a written report within the 15
working days to the director. If the violation involves a discharge that is
prohibited, or exceeds quantity, quality, or concentration limitations, the
report shall contain information regarding the time, date, location, cause,
source, quantity, quality and concentration of the discharge and the corrective
measures actually taken, or to be taken, by the industrial user to correct and
prevent any similar recurring discharges. If the violation is an administrative
or procedural violation, the report shall contain information regarding
corrective measures and time schedules the industrial user has adopted to
assure expeditious compliance.
         (b)   Should the recipient of a notice of violation fail to respond in
writing to the director within the initial 15 working day response period, the
user shall be considered in violation of this section with each day resulting
in a separate violation. Such failure to respond may be cited by the director
in any legal proceeding in the appropriate municipal, county, district, or
federal court.
      (5)   Injunctive relief. When the control authority finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this section, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the control authority may petition the court through the
control authority legal staff for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
section on activities of the user. The control authority may also seek such
other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.
      (6)   Consent orders. The director or his or her designated
representative is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user
to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have legal force and effect and shall be judicially
enforceable. The director may require that a compliance schedule be included
and followed as a condition of the order. No order shall in any way waive a
national categorical pretreatment standard.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or additional
operation and maintenance is necessary to meet the pretreatment standards, then
the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional
pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be utilized. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established
for the applicable pretreatment standard.
      (8)   Compliance orders. When the director or his designated
representative finds that a user has violated or continues to violate the
section, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, he or she may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within 15 calendar days. If the user does not come into compliance within 15
calendar days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and/or management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking
any other action against the user.
      (9)   Emergency suspension. The director may unilaterally order the
suspension of water and/or wastewater service(s) to any user in order to
prevent or eliminate an indirect discharge which may cause imminent, serious
endangerment to the health or safety of any person, significant damage to the
environment, significant interference with the POTW, or violations of the
Control Authority, TCEQ or NPDES permit conditions. Concurrent with ordering
such a suspension, the director shall issue a written report containing
information and investigative data and the notice of violation and suspension
order upon which the director relies in ordering the suspension of service(s).
A copy of this report will be expeditiously forwarded to the affected
industrial user.
         (a)   The director shall order reinstatement of any discontinued water
and/or wastewater service(s) upon presentation to him or her by the industrial
user of a registered professional engineer's report or other written proof
acceptable to the control authority that the dangerous discharge has been
eliminated and that recurrence is not likely.
         (b)   Costs incurred by the control authority or its agents in
detecting, investigating, monitoring, measuring and eliminating the dangerous
discharge, along with any disconnect and reconnect fees, shall be reimbursed to
the control authority by the user(s) responsible for the dangerous discharge
within 60 days of billing. Any property damage to the POTW or its appurtenant
structures resulting from the dangerous discharge shall also be borne by the
user(s) responsible for the discharge.
         (c)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the control authority prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing of this section.
      (10)   Cease and desist orders. When the control authority finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this section, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to
cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
         (c)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
      (11)   Termination of discharge. In addition to other provisions of this
section, any user who violates the following conditions of this section,
wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to
discharge termination.
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling;
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
50.06 of this chapter.
         (f)   Failure to provide, operate and maintain, at all times,
wastewater pretreatment equipment, as is necessary to comply with this
provision.
   (C)   Supplemental enforcement action.
      (1)   Performance bonds. The control authority may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this section, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the control authority, in
a sum not to exceed a value determined by the control authority to be necessary
to achieve consistent compliance.
      (2)   Liability insurance. The control authority may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this section, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
      (3)   Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this section, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
water service to the user may be terminated. Service will only recommence, at
the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to
comply.
      (4)   Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this section, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the control authority. Any person
(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the city
code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the control authority for
any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance, which
shall include, but is not limited to, industrial waste solids accumulation
wastewater odors, vapors, and/or objectionable color(s) of the sanitary and/or
storm sewer.

§ 51.05 OVERVIEW.
   (A)   History. Situated at the juncture of the Atascosa River and Bonita
Creek, Pleasanton was founded in 1858 and named the county seat of Atascosa
County. It was established because the former county seat at Amphion moved due
to conflicts with the Indians. The settlers chose the current town site because
of its location at the mouth of Bonita Creek. John Bowen, San Antonio's first
Anglo-American postmaster, founded and named the town of Pleasanton after his
good friend and fellow early Texas settler, John Pleasants. Also known as the
"Birthplace of the Cowboy," Pleasanton had a growing population of cowboys
around the 19th century primarily to ward off attacks from the Indians. The
county seat was moved from Pleasanton to Jourdanton in 1910. Pleasanton was
incorporated in 1917.
   (B)   Geography. Pleasanton is located in the Nueces River Basin within
eight square miles of Atascosa County. The city is located with the
geographical boundaries of the Region L Regional Water Planning Group,
Evergreen Underground Water Conservation District, and TCEQ Region 13.
   (C)   Climate. An average annual rainfall for Pleasanton is 33.2 inches with
the month of June typically having the most rainfall (4.4 inches). The city
averages 76 days with rainfall each year. Monthly temperature averages range
from 53.4°F in January and December to 86.1°F in August. On average, there are
147 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90°F and 19 days where the
temperature falls below 32°F.
   (D)   Water resources. The City of Pleasanton obtains 100% of its water from
nine groundwater wells in the Carrizo-Wilcox and Queen City aquifers.
(Ord. 15-1141, passed 4-16-2015 ; Ord. 20-1251, passed 8-20-2020)
§ 51.06 OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   The objective of Pleasanton's Water Conservation and Drought
Contingency Plan is to increase efficiency of water use and reduce water
demands without adversely affecting the population and economic growth of the
city. The fundamental strategy for this chapter is to promote and publicize
water conservation activities and drought management strategies in order to
meet our water conservation goals and respond appropriately to water supply
concerns or emergencies.
   (B)   The City of Pleasanton recognizes that the amount of water available
to the city and its water utility customers may be limited and subject to
depletion during periods of extended drought. Representing the best interests
of the citizens of Pleasanton, Texas, the city deems it expedient and necessary
to establish and maintain certain rules and policies for the ongoing
conservation of water and the orderly and efficient management of limited water
supplies during drought and other water supply emergencies.

   (B)   Population. The population of the city has increased steadily
throughout its history. The approved 2021 TWDB and Region L population
projections, shown below, predict that the city will have over 18,000 residents
by 2070.
   (C)   Water system. The city currently serves 4,592 connections. There are
1,850,000 gallons above ground storage in four elevated storage tanks and
2,350,000 gallons of ground storage. The city operates seven wells.
   (D)   Wastewater system. The city owns approximately 90 miles of collection
system, five lift stations, and one wastewater treatment plant. The wastewater
plant facility (Atascosa River Facility, WQ0010598001) is located approximately
0.4 miles southeast of the intersection of US Highway 281 and the Missouri
Pacific Railroad and 0.5 miles east of the intersection of State Highway 97 and
US Highway 281. Treated effluent is discharged from Outfall 001 via an 18-inch
pipe into the Atascosa River in Segment No. 2107 of the Nueces River Basin.
Designated uses for this segment are high aquatic life uses, public water
supply, and contact recreation. The plant has an average flow of 0.734 million
gallons per day (MGD) and a two hour peak flow of 1,219 gallons per minute
(GPM). The permitted maximum daily flow is 1.42 MGD and the maximum two hour
peak flow is 2,958 GPM.
   (E)   Water supply. The City of Pleasanton obtains 100% of its water from
groundwater wells in the Carrio-Wilcox and Queen City aquifers.
   (F)   Water demands. The city has averaged 630 million gallons (1,923 acre-
feet) of water use annually over the previous five years.
   (G)   Water use sectors. The distribution of retail connections within the
city is distributed between residential and commercial sectors. Eighty-eight
percent of connections are for residential use, 19% are commercial and 1% are
industrial. Overall, 57% of water use is residential, 43% is commercial and 1%
is industrial.
      (1)   Retail connections in 2019:
         (a)   Commercial/industrial: 930, 20%;
         (b)   Residential: 3,824, 80%.
      (2)   Water use (gallons) in 2019:
         (a)   Commercial/industrial: 260,571,000, 44%;
         (b)   Residential: 336,176,000, 56%.
   (H)   Per capita water use. Per capita water use is generally expressed in
gallons per customer per day (GPCD) and is the average amount of water used by
each person in the population served by a water utility. Variables that can
influence GPCD include the relative amount of non-residential water uses, the
rate and type of growth, economics, climatic conditions, and demographics.
Residential GPCD is a superior metric measurement for understanding how much
water each resident is actually using and does not include commercial and
industrial uses. Currently, the city’s total GPCD is 166 and the residential
GPCD is 83.

(Ord. 15-1141, passed 4-16-2015; Ord. 20-1251, passed 8-20-2020)
§ 51.16 LEAK DETECTION, REPAIR, AND WATER LOSS CONTROL.
   (A)   The city operates and maintains the water transmission system within
the city. In order to maintain water delivery service and to reduce and control
unaccounted for water, city staff routinely visually inspect the distribution
system to identify abnormal conditions indicating leaks. The staff is equipped
to respond and repair equipment and pipeline breaks or employ contract
assistance as required. As a result of these measures, water loss has been
maintained at or below 10% (14 GPCD) over the previous five years. The city’s
goals for water loss for the next five and ten years is to maintain less than
10% (14 GPCD) water loss.
   (B)   The city has a continuous leak detection, location, and repair
program. City meters have recently been replaced by smart meters. Monthly
audits of consumption and production volumes are utilized to determine trends
for water loss and more immediate action steps to locate water leaks.
Continuous surveillance by meter readers and city servicemen provide immediate
response to water leaks.
   (C)   Utility main line flushing is necessary in order to comply with state
and federal drinking water standards. Records are maintained to track flushing
amounts and this use is not considered water loss.
(Ord. 15-1141, passed 4-16-2015; Ord. 20-1251, passed 8-20-2020)
§ 51.17 WATER RATE STRUCTURE.

cost based and encourages water conservation.
(Ord. 15-1141, passed 4-16-2015; Ord. 20-1251, passed 8-20-2020)
§ 51.18 PLUMBING FIXTURES.
   (A)   The State of Texas has recently adopted more stringent water saving
performance measures for plumbing fixtures, found in the Tex. Health & Safety
Code, Chapter 372. The following maximum flow standards are subsequently listed
in the Tex. Admin. Code, Title 30, Chapter 290(G):
 
Plumbing Fixtures     Maximum Flow
Faucet                2.2 (GPM)
Shower head           2.5 (GPM)
Toilet                1.28 (GPF)
Urinal                0.5 (GPF)
Pre-rinse spray valve 1.6 (GPM)
 
   (B)   Customers in existing buildings that do not have water saving plumbing
fixtures are encouraged to retrofit their old plumbing fixtures. New
construction, including remodeling of existing structures, must comply with
city and state plumbing fixture standards. There are a wide assortment of water
efficient fixtures, clothes and dish washers that provide the same performance,
but use less water. A water efficient home can save more than 20% of annual
indoor water use.

§ 51.19 WATER-CONSERVING LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Water-conserving landscaping is a development concept that encourages
residents to adopt low- water-using landscaping principles and methods for use
around the home. The same concepts can be applied to other landscaped areas as
well, including parks and other public places.
   (B)   A popular method of reducing water use for landscape irrigation is to
encourage residents to use the following techniques for landscaping. The
following are generally accepted principles when planning a water efficient
yard:
      (1)   Planning and design. During this step an appropriate plan is
developed considering such variables as climate, existing vegetation, intended
use of the space, and topographic features;
      (2)   Soil analysis. Examine the soil types covering the whole site;
      (3)   Appropriate plant selection. Plants should be selected which are
native to the area or are adaptive to the site;
      (4)   Practical turf areas. Plan where turf areas should be located and
consider increasing the area of decks, porous paving, paths, and mulched
planting beds to reduce turf;
      (5)   Efficient irrigation. Landscaped areas should only be watered as
needed and then usually during the early morning or late evening to avoid water
lost due to evaporation, keeping in mind some plant species may experience mold
and/or fungus growth if watered at night;
      (6)   Use of mulches. A three- to four-inch layer of mulch should cover
all exposed soil areas and be replenished twice a year; and
      (7)   Appropriate maintenance. Keep the yard well maintained to reduce
the use of fertilizer, chemicals, and water.
(Ord. 15-1141, passed 4-16-2015 ; Ord. 20-1251, passed 8-20-2020)
§ 51.20 CUSTOMER SERVICE INSPECTIONS.
   A customer service inspection certification as required by the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), Tex. Admin. Code, Title 30, Chapter
290, § 290.46, shall be completed prior to providing continuous water service
to new construction or any existing service when the city has reason to believe
that cross-connections or other unacceptable plumbing practices exist; or after
any material improvement, correction, or addition to the private plumbing
facilities. The existence of a serious threat to the integrity of the public
water supply shall be considered sufficient grounds for immediate termination
of water service.

protection against high health hazards must also be tested and certified to be
operating within specifications at least annually by a recognized backflow
prevention device tester.
   (B)   Backflow assembly testing and installation shall be completed as
required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), Texas
Administrative Code, Title 30, Chapter 290, § 290.44(H).
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the customer at any premise where backflow
prevention assemblies are installed to have a certified inspection and
operational tests conducted annually. In those instances where the city deems
the hazard to be deleterious to human health, customer service inspection
certifications may be required semiannually. Inspections and tests shall be at
the expense of the customer or customer representative and shall be performed
by a certified backflow technician.
   (D)   Assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense
of the customer whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of
such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and submitted to the city
within five days of the test, repairs, or overhaul of each backflow prevention
assembly.
   (E)   No device or assembly shall be removed from use, relocated, or other
device or assembly substituted without the approval of the city. Whenever the
existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than
minimum maintenance, or when the city finds that the maintenance constitutes a
hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a backflow prevention assembly
complying with requirements of this section and the current adopted Plumbing
Code of the city.
   (F)   A test report must be completed by the recognized backflow prevention
assembly tester for each assembly tested. The signed and dated original must be
submitted to the city, Community Development Division, within five days of
test.
   (G)   A recognized backflow prevention assembly tester must have completed a
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) approved course on cross-
connection control and backflow prevention and pass an examination administered
by the TCEQ or its designated agent.

or plug a well or injection well for the purpose of earth-coupled beat exchange
system, or to engage upon such work, within the city or the Public Works
Department service area, or to employ anyone else to engage in such work,
without first applying for and securing a permit from the Public Works
Department.
(Ord. 23-1315, passed 5-11-2023)
§ 52.03 REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   Water wells shall be so located that there will be no danger of
pollution from flooding or from unsanitary surroundings, such as privies,
sewage, sewage treatment plants, livestock and animal pens, solid waste
disposal sites, underground fuel storage tanks, or abandoned and improperly
sealed wells.
   (B)   No well site which is within 50 feet of a tile or concrete sanitary
sewer, or storm sewer, or which is within 150 feet of a sewerage appurtenance,
septic tank, septic tank perforated drain field, absorption bed,
evapotranspiration bed or underground fuel storage tank will be acceptable for
the development of the water well. Sanitary or storm sewer constructed of
ductile iron or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe meeting American Water Works
Association (AWWA) standards, having a minimum working pressure of 150 pounds
per square inch (psi) or greater, and equipped with pressure-type joints may be
located at distances of less than 50 feet from a proposed well site, but in no
case shall the distance be less than ten feet.
   (C)   No well site shall be selected which is within 500 feet of a sewage
treatment plant or within 300 feet of a sewage wet well, sewage pumping
station, or a drainage ditch which contains industrial waste discharges or the
wastes from sewage treatment works.
   (D)   No water well shall be located within 500 feet of animal feedlots,
solid waste disposal sites, lands on which sewage plant or septic tank sludge
is applied, or lands irrigated by sewage plant effluent.
   (E)   No water well shall be located within 1,500 feet of a city public
water well, and shall pose no threat to the continued production of the city
well.
   (F)   Livestock in pastures will not be allowed within 50 feet of the water
well.
   (G)   Wellheads and pump bases shall be sealed by a gasket or sealing
compound and properly vented to prevent the possibility of contaminating the
well water. A well-casing vent shall be provided with an opening that is
covered with size 16 mesh or finer corrosion-resistant screen, facing downward,
elevated and located so as to minimize the drawing of contaminants into the
well. Wellheads and well vents shall be at least two feet above the highest
known watermark or 100-year flood elevation, if available, or adequately
protected from possible flood damage by levees.
   (H)   Sanitary control easements covering land within 150 feet of the well
are required. The sanitary control easement secured shall provide that none of
the pollution hazards, or any facilities that might create a danger of
pollution to the water to be produced from the well, will be located thereon.
For the purpose of a sanitary control easement, an improperly constructed water
well is one which fails to meet the surface and subsurface construction
standards for public water supply wells. Residential type wells within a
sanitary control easement must be constructed to public water well standards. A
copy of the recorded sanitary control easement shall be included with plans and
specifications submitted to the Public Works Director for review. With the
approval of the Public Works Director, the applicant may submit any of the
following as a substitute for obtaining, recording, and submitting a copy of
the recorded sanitary control easement covering land within 150 feet of the

      (1)   A copy of the recorded deed and map demonstrating that the
applicant owns all real property within 150 feet of the well.
      (2)   A copy of the recorded deed and map demonstrating that the
applicant owns a portion of real property within 150 feet of the well, and a
copy of the sanitary control easement that the applicant has, obtained,
recorded, and submitted to the Public Works Director applicable to the
remaining portion of real property within 150 feet of the well not owned by the
applicant.
      (3)   For a political subdivision, a copy of an ordinance or land use
restriction adopted and enforced by the political subdivision which provides an
equivalent or higher level of sanitary protection to the well as a sanitary
control easement. Any lines crossing under or across a city easement, street,
or right-of-way must be submitted on plans from a licensed professional
engineer and will meet the construction standards approved by the Public Works
Director for the city.

      (1)   A person commits an offense if he or she operates a vehicle in a
school traffic zone at a speed greater than indicated on the applicable school
zone sign, and any speed in excess of the speed shall be prima facie evidence
that the speed is not reasonable or prudent and is unlawful.
      (2)   The City Manager shall supervise the designation of school traffic
zones with appropriate street markings or signs. The speed limit designated for
school traffic zones shall be effective only at the times when appropriate
signs advising motorists of the speed limit are placed in conspicuous places.

§ 71.01 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   (A)   The Pleasanton Municipal Airport shall hereinafter be referred to as
the Airport Authority. A ground lease or hangar tenant share hereinafter be
referred to as "Airport Tenant".
   (B)   The following minimum standards and requirements for commercial
aeronautical activities have been established in the public interest for the
safe and efficient operation of the City of Pleasanton Municipal Airport; to
enhance its orderly growth; to preclude the granting of an exclusive right to
conduct an aeronautical activity in violation of § 308(a) of the Federal
Aviation Act of 1958; to conform to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and Part 21 of the Department of Transportation Regulations, and to assure to
all lessees the availability of airport property on fair and reasonable terms
and without unjust discrimination. If and when there is a conflict between
these standards and the City of Pleasanton Municipal Airport Rules and
Regulations, the latter shall prevail.
      (1)   A COMMERCIAL FIXED BASE OPERATOR is defined as any person, firm, or
corporation performing any of the functions or furnishing any of the services
as hereinafter set out for fixed base operators at the Pleasanton Municipal
Airport. No person, firm, or corporation shall engage in any commercial
activity as a FIXED BASE OPERATOR as herein defined unless the same is done in
full compliance with the standards, rules and regulations herein set forth.
      (2)   An AIRPORT TENANT is defined as any person, firm, or corporation
leasing property at the Pleasanton Municipal Airport for aeronautical purposes,
who is not a fixed base operator. An AIRPORT TENANT may hangar his aircraft on
his leased property subject to the provisions of §
71.04 hereof.
      (3)   All fixed base operators and airport tenants shall protect the
public generally, the customers or clients of such fixed base operators, and
the Authority from any and all lawful damages, claims, or liability and shall
carry comprehensive general liability insurance in a company authorized to do
business in the State of Texas with limits as prescribed in the respective
categories, with the Authority named as an additional insured, which policies
must be approved by the Authority and a certificate of insurance thereof
furnished to the Authority. It is further understood that as circumstances in
the future dictate, the Authority may require an increase in bodily injury and
property damage insurance.
      (4)   A fixed base operator shall satisfy the lessor that it is
technically and financially able to perform the services of a fixed base
operator. This shall include the responsibility for demonstrating continued
financial solvency and business ability by the submitting of an annual balance
sheet, credit references and any other proof that the lessor may require from
time to time. In cases of doubt by the lessor to such ability of a fixed base
operator, the lessor may conduct a hearing to determine appropriate action. In
each instance, the lessor shall be the final judge as to the qualifications and
financial ability of the lessee. The Authority will not accept an original
request to lease land area unless the proposed lessee puts forth in writing a
proposal which sets forth the scope of operation he proposes, including the
following:
         (a)   The service he will offer.
         (b)   The amount of land he desires to lease.
         (c)   The building space he will construct or lease.
         (d)   The number of aircraft he will provide.
         (e)   The number of persons he will employ.

above services and facilities.
      (5)   Any person, firm or corporation capable of meeting the minimum
standards set forth herein for any of the stated fixed base operator categories
is eligible to become a fixed base operator at the airport, subject to the
execution of a written lease containing such terms and conditions as may be
determined by the Authority. A fixed base operator or airport tenant shall not
engage in any business or activity on the airport other than that authorized
under his particular category or categories. Any fixed base operator desiring
to extend his operation into more than one category or to discontinue
operations in a category, shall first apply in writing to the Airport Authority
for permission to do so, setting forth in detail the reasons and conditions for
the request. The Airport Authority shall then grant or deny the request on such
terms and conditions as the Authority deems to be prudent and proper under the
circumstances. Each fixed base operator shall provide his own buildings,
personnel and equipment, and other requirements as herein stated upon land
leased from the Authority.
      (6)   All fixed base operators at said airport shall provide ample
lounges and restrooms for their customers and shall make telephone service
conveniently and readily available for public use.
      (7)   All construction required of such operators shall be in accordance
with design and construction standards required or established by the Authority
for the facility or activity involved. Title to any and all buildings and
appurtenances, which may be built on Authority property, shall revert to the
Authority, when and if the subject lessee vacates the lease for any reason.
      (8)   The rates or charges for any and all activities and services of
such operators shall be determined by the operators, subject to the approval of
the Authority, and subject, further, to the requirement that all such rates or
charges shall be reasonable and be equally and fairly applied to all users of
the services.
      (9)   All operators at the airport shall be full time or part time,
financially sound and progressive business enterprises, with adequately manned
and equipped facilities, including ample office facilities, and who observe
normal or specifically required business hours.
      (10)   All fixed base operators shall, at their own expense, pay all
taxes and assessments against any buildings or other structures placed on the
premises by them, as well as all taxes and assessments against the personal
property used by them in their operations.
      (11)   All operators shall abide by and comply with all state, county and
city laws and ordinances, the rules and regulations of the Authority, and the
rules and regulations of the state and the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA).
      (12)   In the event, the Authority constructs the physical plant
facilities (hangars, etc.) for use by any operator under the provisions of any
lease or other contract, such lease or contract with such operators shall be on
such terms and conditions as to guarantee a full return of the investment
within a reasonable time period as established by the city.
      (13)   All operators shall provide and pay for all lights, gas,
electrical current, water, sewer charges and garbage collection charges used or
incurred anywhere in or about the leased premises, and shall pay the charges
made therefore by the suppliers thereof promptly when due.
      (14)   All contracts and leases between such operators and the Authority
shall be subordinate to the provisions of any existing or future agreement(s)
between the Authority and the United States, relative to the operation or
maintenance of the Airport.
      (15)   No fixed base operators shall sublease or sublet any premises
leased by such operator from the Airport Authority, or assign any such lease,
without the prior written approval of the Authority, and any such subletting or
assignment shall be subject to all of the minimum standards herein set forth.
      (16)   In the event the lessee sublets any portion of his lease, the
sublessee must agree to assume the full obligations of the lease as set out
herein and must agree to fully cooperate with the Authority in seeing that
these standards are complied with. The sublessee shall immediately comply with
any reasonable request or direction of the Authority as it relates to the
enforcement of these standards.
      (17)   In the event that the lessee or sublessee fails to comply fully
with these standards or fails to comply with the reasonable request or
direction of the Authority as it relates to these standards, said lessee or
sublessee shall be in default. If said default continues for more than 30 days
after notice of said default, the Authority may terminate the lease. Said
lessee is responsible for the performance of the sublessee.
      (18)   Fixed base operators shall have the right to use common areas and
facilities of the airport, including runways, taxiways, aprons, roadways,
floodlights, landing lights, signals and other conveniences for the takeoff,
flying and landing of aircraft of lessee.
      (19)   Beginning with the effective date of adoption of these minimum
standards, leases to fixed base operators and airport tenants shall be limited
to a maximum of 25 years, including options. In addition, leases shall, at the
discretion of the Authority, be subject to review, in relation to the consumer
price index. In this regard, when at the end of each of said five-year period,
the cost of living index is determined by the Authority to be higher than the
previous five-year period, the rental terms thereof shall be increased to such
percentage of increase or of said cost of living index. If at the end of such
five-year period the said cost of living index has decreased, the Authority
shall take no action to review or reevaluate the lease.
      (20)   Lessees will, at all times during the continuance of the term of
the lease and any renewal or extension thereof, conduct, operate and maintain
for the benefit of the flying public, the fixed base operation provided for and
described therein, and provide all parts and services as defined and set forth,
and will make all such services available to the public and that it will devote
its best efforts for the accomplishment of such purposes and that it will at
all times charge fair, reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory prices to
patrons and customers for all merchandise or materials and services furnished
or rendered. Notwithstanding anything contained in a lease that may be or
appear to the contrary, it is expressly understood and agreed that the rights
granted hereunder are nonexclusive and the lessor reserves the right to grant
similar privileges to another operator or operators upon formal application by
that operator, and upon demonstration of compliance with divisions (B)(4) and
(B)(5) herein.
      (21)   All contracts and leases between such operators and the Authority
shall be subordinate to the right of the Authority during time of war or,
national emergency to lease the landing area or any part thereof to the United
States Government for military or naval use, and if any such lease is executed,
the provisions of any contracts or leases between such operators and the
Authority, insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of the lease to
the government, shall be suspended.
      (22)   Upon adoption of these standards all leases entered into and any
amendments to existing leases shall be in accordance with the standards.
Present lease holders shall be granted 12 months to comply with all standards
set forth. Requests for exceptions to these standards shall be made in writing
to the Authority.
      (23)   The lessee shall remove from the airport or otherwise dispose of
in a manner approved by the Authority all garbage, debris, and other waste
material (whether solid or liquid) arising out of its occupancy of the premises
or out of its operations. Said lessee shall keep and maintain his leased
premises in a neat and orderly manner; lessee shall keep the grass cut and the
building painted. Any garbage, debris, or waste which may be temporarily stored
in the open shall be kept in suitable garbage or waste receptacles, the same to
be made of metal and equipped with tight fitting covers and to be of a design
to safely and properly contain whatever may be placed therein. The lessee shall
use extreme care when effecting removal of all such waste.
      (24)   The Authority reserves the right to enter upon any premises leased
to fixed base operators at reasonable times for the purpose of making such
inspections as it may deem expedient to the proper enforcement of these minimum
standards and for the proper enforcement of any covenant or condition of any
fixed base operator's contract or lease agreement.
      (25)   The Authority recognizes the rights of any person, firm or
corporation operating aircraft on the airport to perform services on its own
aircraft with its own regular employees (including, but not limited to
maintenance, repair and fueling) that it may choose to perform. Aircraft
fueling accomplished under this provision shall be in strict accordance with
Categories D and E herein and any safety regulations and/or ordinances as
referenced in division (B)(11).
      (26)   All operations conducted at the airport will be conducted in the
safest manner possible and for the maximum benefit of the flying public and the
citizens of the surrounding area.
      (27)   Where these standards call for a minimum square footage of space,
and the applicant is permitted to conduct more than one activity, then such
applicant shall have the minimum square footage for that activity which
requires the greatest minimum square footage.
      (28)   Standard lease provisions. All leases, subleases, contracts or
franchises for airport property, or for airport operations or use, shall
contain the following standard provisions:
         (a)   The right to conduct aeronautical activities for furnishing

provisions of the lease to the government, shall be suspended.
         (f)   No right or privilege has been granted which would operate to
prevent any person, firm or corporation operating aircraft on the airport from
performing any services on its own aircraft with its own regular employees
(including but not limited to maintenance, repair, and fueling) that it, may

established, that said lessor or its agents, servants, or employees were
negligent, or that their conduct or omission in any way caused or contributed
to any such liability, expense, damage, cause of action, or attorneys' fees.
         (r)   The purpose of the lease and the operations to be conducted by
lessee or sublessee, and the identity of the premises to be occupied, are set

the premises described herein be subleased, in whole or in part, without the
prior written consent of the lessor. Such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

within the corporate limits of the city.
(Ord. 12-1058, passed 7-19-2012)
§ 98.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the preservation of mature
trees, which once removed can be replaced only after generations, to preserve
protected trees during construction, and to control the removal of protected
trees when necessary. It is the intent of this chapter to achieve the
following:

properties within the city.
   (C)   Maintain and enhance a positive image for the attraction of new
business enterprises to the city.
   (D)   Protect healthy quality trees and promote the natural ecological
environmental and aesthetic qualities of the city.

heat by reducing the ambient temperature.
(Ord. 12-1058, passed 7-19-2012)
§ 98.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CONTIGUOUS RESIDENTIAL LOTS. Three or more adjoining lots.
   DBH or DIAMETER-AT-BREAST-HEIGHT (CALIPER). Tree trunk diameter measured in
inches at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits
into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, the tree shall be measured
in two places, the narrowest point beneath the split and one-half the sum of
the calipers of the trunks immediately above the split. Whichever is the
greater measurement is to be the measurement applied. If there is no single
trunk above ground level to measure, the measurement shall be the sum of the
main trunk, plus one-half of all other branches of the calipers of the various
trunks at breast height.
   DRIPLINE. A vertical line run through the outermost portion of the canopy of
a tree and extending to the ground.
   GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. The city, independent school districts, state and
county property; property owned by the United States of America or other
federal agencies. Examples of this would include City Hall, public parks, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers’ property, state ROW, libraries, fire stations, water
tower sites or similar properties.
   HERITAGE TREES. Trees having a 24-inch DBH and not belonging to the
unauthorized species list.
   MITIGATION. Tree replacement with an authorized species.
   MULTI-TRUNK TREE. A tree with more than one trunk arising at or near the
ground.
   PERVIOUS. Water will permeate the surface.
   PROTECTED TREES. Trees having a six-inch DBH and not belonging to the
unauthorized species list.
   PROTECTIVE FENCING. Snow fencing, chainlink fence, barbed-wire fence, orange
vinyl construction fencing or other similar fencing with a four-foot
approximate height.
   ROOT PROTECTION ZONE (RPZ). The area of undisturbed natural soil around a
tree defined by a concentric circle with a radius equal to the distance from
the trunk to the outermost portion of the dripline. As a practical matter, this
is the acute portion of the tree’s root system. Approximately 90% of the tree’s
root mass occurs within the top three feet of the soil and most of the fine
feeder roots which collect moisture and nutrients are located in the top six
inches of the soil. Typically, a tree’s root system extends as much as two to
three times the distance from the trunk to the dripline.
   TREE AFFIDAVIT. An affirmation by the developer/landowner that there are not
heritage or protected trees in a proposed development or subdivision.
   TREE CROWN. Parts of the tree above the trunk including leaves, branches,
limbs and scaffold: the uppermost part of the tree.
   TREE PRESERVATION/REMOVAL PERMIT. The permit required when heritage/
protected trees are to be removed.
(Ord. 12-1058, passed 7-19-2012)
§ 98.04 DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTED.
   All developments for which a master plan has not yet been submitted as of
August 1, 2012, shall be subject to the requirements for tree protection,
replacement, trimming and pruning specified in this chapter.

of this chapter as it pertains to that residential property.
(Ord. 12-1058, passed 7-19-2012)
§ 98.07 EXCEPTIONS.
   A tree removal permit and tree protection and replacement requirements shall
not be required under any of the following circumstances:
   (A)   Damaged/diseased trees. The tree is dead, diseased, damaged beyond the
point of recovery, in danger of falling, or endangers the public health,
welfare or safety as determined by the City Manager or his or her designee.
   (B)   Utility service interruption. The tree has disrupted a public utility
service due to a tornado, storm, flood or other act of nature. Removal shall be

would result in creation of an unnecessary hardship or impractical application
of the plan, considering the physical characteristics of the lot or parcel of
land in question.
(Ord. 12-1058, passed 7-19-2012)
§ 98.09 REPLACEMENT AND PROTECTION OF EXISTING TREES.
   (A)   Developers/subdividers must submit a tree affidavit or a tree
preservation plan with their preliminary plats. However, a tree preservation
plan must be submitted no later than when a building permit is requested. The
trimming or pruning of trees is only allowed by permit and must be done by a
certified landscape professional or arborist. Either a tree affidavit or tree
preservation/removal permit is required for approval of final plats by the
Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council. Any tree plan or survey which
shows that protected or heritage trees will be removed shall be accompanied by
a tree removal application and a plan for replacement pursuant to the tree
replacement definition. The burden shall be upon the applicant to show the
necessity for all trees being removed. No person, directly or indirectly, shall
cut down, destroy, remove or move, or effectively destroy through damaging, any
protected tree situated on property regulated by this chapter without first
obtaining a tree removal permit unless otherwise specified in this chapter,
except as follows:
      (1)   Right-of-way owned or leased by a governmental entity as of August
1, 2012.
      (2)   Property owned or leased by a public utility excluding property
used for administration offices or functions.
   (B)   Prior to approval of a planned development or a final subdivision
plat, each subdivider or developer may contribute cash in lieu of replacing
trees pursuant to the tree replacement definition under this section and may
pay into the General Fund to benefit the Parks and Recreation Department of the
city or any combination thereof as determined by the City Manager. The cash
contribution in lieu of replacing trees shall be a negotiated value subject to
the approval of the City Manager based on the number, value, character, size,
and age of trees removed. All cash contributions shall be evaluated on a case-
by-case basis. Cash contributions received by the city shall be received by the
City Manager and forwarded to the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance
shall deposit the funds directly into the General Fund to benefit the Parks and
Recreation Department of the city, as established by the City Council.

§ 98.10 TREE REMOVAL PERMIT.
   Existing protected or heritage trees shall not be removed from the land
without first obtaining a tree removal permit:
   (A)   A tree affidavit is used when there are no heritage or protected trees
in the proposed development; or when no heritage tree will be damaged or
removed; or when no protected tree will be damaged or removed except in that
area inside the proposed building footprints or inside the street rights-of-way
and drainage and utility easements for residential development.
   (B)   An application for a tree preservation/removal permit is submitted
when protected trees will be removed except inside the setbacks, street rights-
of-way and drainage and utility easements for residential development. A tree
reservation plan/removal permit is required for the removal of a heritage tree
regardless of its location. A tree preservation plan with an inventory of
existing trees is required in order to calculate diameter-inches that will be
removed versus the number of inches that will be preserved. In addition, a tree
preservation plan includes notes on methods of tree protection during
construction and justification for removing protected or heritage trees. This
permit will be issued after the City Code Enforcement Office has evaluated and
approved the tree preservation plan.
(Ord. 12-1058, passed 7-19-2012)
§ 98.11 TREE PRESERVATION PLAN.
   (A)   At a minimum, a tree preservation plan includes:

setbacks, parking areas, and sidewalks.
      (3)   Location, species, and size in DBH of each heritage tree and each
protected tree except those located inside the footprint of proposed structures
for commercial development. Driveways and parking facilities are included as
structures.
      (4)   Tree inventory that summarizes the total number of DBH inches to be
removed and to be preserved (trees down to 1 1/2-inch DBH can be used in
calculating preservation diameter inches).
   (B)   Existing protected or heritage trees shall not be removed from the
land without first obtaining a tree preservation/removal permit from the city.
The land developer will submit a tree preservation plan and inventory to the
City Code Enforcement Office.
   (C)   The City Code Enforcement Office has the approval authority for all
tree preservation plans and will make note of the tree preservation plan
approval on their plat review. Specifically, it will be noted that the tree
preservation plan meets the city’s requirements and is on file with the plat in

      (7)   Wells or retaining walls around the RPZ will be used if proposed
finished grades will raise or lower the natural RPZ grade by more than six
inches.
      (8)   The finished RPZ will be pervious except for those areas excluded
in division (A)(12) below.
      (9)   For commercial, multifamily and other developments, a minimum of
25% of the total DBH must be preserved.
      (10)   For single-family residential development of single or contiguous
lots, contiguous lots include three or more lots, a minimum of 50% of total DBH
must be preserved.
      (11)   For individual lots, 45% of total DBH must be preserved.

shall be mailed to the mortgagee(s) or lienholder(s) of the dangerous building
by certified mail, return receipt requested, to their last known address; and/
or
      (5)   The notice provided for in divisions (H)(1) through (4) above shall
set forth:
         (a)   A legal description of the building deemed dangerous and the
property on which the building is located;
         (b)   A description of the violation of the city's standards, as
outlined in division (C) above, that is present at the building; and
         (c)   A statement that the city will vacate, secure, remove or
demolish the building, or relocate the occupants of the building if the ordered
action is not taken within the allotted time specified by the City Council and
in accordance with this subchapter.
      (6)   This notice shall also comply with the requirements outlined in §
150.23(A) below.
   (I)   In connection with the securing of a building, the securing of
windows, doors or any other opening allowing access to an unsecured unoccupied
building shall be done with the materials and in such a fashion as to
effectively bar entrance to the building including but not limited to plywood,
lumber, steel, replacement glass, nails, screws and bolts as well as the use of
fencing. The use of cardboard, tar paper, window and door screens or any other
material that will not effectively prevent entrance shall not be sufficient to
meet the requirements of this section, nor shall it be considered sufficient to
make a building in compliance with a notice by the city's Building Inspector to
secure. Upon receipt of a notice by the city's Building Inspector to secure
each and every accessible means of entry must be secured in accordance with
this section. The city itself may install a fence to secure the entire
premises.
   (J)   If the dangerous building is not vacated, secured, repaired, removed,
or demolished, or the occupants are not relocated within the allotted time
specified by the city, the city may vacate, secure, remove or demolish the
dangerous building or relocate the occupants of the dangerous building at its
own expense.
   (K)   If the city incurs expenses under division (J) above, the city may
assess the expenses on, and the city has a lien against, unless it is a
homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, the property in which the
dangerous building is or was located. Expenses incurred by the city under
division (J) above shall include the cost of labor, materials and any other
related costs plus an administrative fee of $150. The lien is extinguished if
the owner or any other person(s) having an interest in the legal title to the
property reimburses the city for the expenses. The lien arises and attaches to
the property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the
Atascosa County Clerk's Office. The notice of lien and notice of assessment
must contain the name and address of the owner(s), if that information can be
determined with a reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property
on which the building is or was located, the amount of expenses incurred by the
city, and the balance due. The notice of lien and notice of assessment shall be
sent to owner(s) at the last known address at the time the lien attaches
requesting that the balance due be paid immediately.
   (L)   If the notice is given and the opportunity to repair, remove or
demolish the dangerous building is afforded to each mortgagee(s) and lienholder
(s) as authorized by divisions (H)(1), (2), (3) and (4), the lien is a
privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens and all previously recorded
bonafide mortgage liens attached to the real property to which the city's lien
attaches.
   (M)   (1)   Any owner(s), lienholder(s) or mortgagee(s) of record of
property jointly or severally aggrieved by an ordinance of the city issued
under division (F)(7) above may file in the District Court a verified petition
setting forth that the decision is illegal, in whole or in part, as specifying
the grounds of the illegality. The petition must be filed by an owner(s),
lienholder(s) or mortgagee(s) within 30 calendar days after the respective
dates a copy of the ordinance of the city is mailed to them by first class
mail, certified return receipt requested, or the decision shall become final as
to each of them upon the expiration of each such 30-calendar day.
      (2)   On the filing of the petition, the court may issue a writ of
certiorari directed to the city to review the ordinance of the city and shall
prescribe in the writ a time within which a return on the writ must be made,
which must be longer than ten days, and served on the relater or the relater's
attorney.
      (3)   The city may not be required to return the original papers acted on
by it, but it is sufficient for the city to return certified or sworn copies of
the papers or of parts of the papers as may be called for by the writ.
      (4)   The return must concisely set forth other facts as may be pertinent
and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be
verified.
      (5)   The issuance of the writ does not stay proceedings on the decision
appealed from.
      (6)   Appeal in the District Court shall be limited to a hearing under
the substantial evidence rule. The court may reverse or affirm, in whole or in
part, or may modify the decision brought up for review.
      (7)   Costs may not be allowed against the city.
      (8)   If the decision of the city is affirmed or not substantially
reversed but only modified, the District Court shall allow to the city all
attorneys fees and other costs and expenses incurred by it and shall enter a
judgment for those items, which may be entered against the property owners,
lienholders or mortgagees as well as all persons subject to the proceedings
before the city.

§ 150.21 SECURING BUILDINGS.
   (A)   In addition to the procedures outlined in §
150.20 above for securing buildings or structures, the city may secure a
building or structure as provided for in this section. This section is adopted
pursuant to the authority granted the city under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code, §
214.0011.
   (B)   The city may secure a building the city determines:
      (1)   Violates minimum standards specified in §
150.20(C) above; and
      (2)   Is unoccupied or is occupied only by persons who do not have a
right of possession to the building or structure.
   (C)   Before the eleventh day after the day the building is secured, the
city's Building Inspector shall give notice to the owner by:
      (1)   Personally serving the owner with written notice;
      (2)   Depositing a written notice in the United States mail (certified
mail - return receipt requested) addressed to the owner at the owner's post
office address;
      (3)   Publishing the notice at least twice within a ten-day period in a
newspaper of general circulation in Atascosa County if personal service cannot
be obtained and the owner's post office address is unknown; or
      (4)   Posting the notice on or near the front door of the dangerous
building if personal service cannot be obtained and the owner's post office
address is unknown.
   (D)   (1)   For purposes of division (C) above, the notice must contain the
following elements:
         (a)   An identification (which is not required to be a legal
description) of the building and the property on which the building is located;
         (b)   A description of the violation of the city's standards, as
outlined in §
150.20(C) above, and division (B) above that is present at the building;
         (c)   A statement that the city will secure or has secured, as the
case may be, the building; and
         (d)   An explanation of the owner's entitlement to request a hearing
about any matter relating to the city's securing of the building.
      (2)   This notice shall also comply with the requirements outlined in §
150.23(A) below.
   (E)   The City Council shall conduct a hearing at which the owner may
testify or present witnesses or written information about any matter relating
to the city's securing of the building if, within 30 days after the date the
city secures the building, the owner files with the city a written request for
the hearing. The City Council shall conduct a hearing within 20 days after the
date the request is filed. Failure to submit a written request for a hearing
before the City Council about any matter relating to the city's securing of a
building within the 30-day period specified in the notice shall constitute a
waiver of the right to a hearing.
   (F)   The city has the right to assess expenses under this section as it has
to assess expenses under §
150.20(J) above. A lien is created under this section in the same amount that a
lien is created under §
150.20(I) and (K) above and is subject to the same conditions as a lien created
under §
150.20(J) above.
(Ord. 1079, passed 1-20-1994)
§ 150.22 AUTHORITY OF CITY.
   (A)   In addition to the rights of the city under §
150.20 above, after the expiration of the time allotted under §
150.20(F) and (H) above, for the repair, removal or demolition of a building,
the city may:
      (1)   Repair the building at the expense of the city and assess the
expenses on the land on which the building stands or to which it is attached;
or
      (2)   Assess a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per day
against the property owner of the building for failure to repair, remove or
demolish the building.
         (a)   Each day that the owner of the building fails to comply with the
City Council's ordered action after the expiration of the time period in which
to act as provided in this subchapter shall constitute a separate civil
penalty.
         (b)   This section is adopted pursuant to the authority granted the
city under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code §§ 54.012 to 54.019 and 214.0015.
   (B)   The city may repair a building under division (A) above only to the
extent necessary to bring the building into compliance with the minimum
standards and only if the building is a residential building with ten or fewer
dwelling units. The repairs may not improve the building to the extent that the
building exceeds minimum housing standards.
   (C)   If the city incurs expenses or assesses a civil penalty under division
(A) or (B) above, the city shall impose a lien against the land on which the
building stands or stood, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas
Constitution, for the payment of the repair, removal or demolition expenses or
the civil penalty. Promptly after the imposition of the lien, the city's
Building Inspector shall file for record, in recordable form in the Atascosa

containing the name and address of the owner, if that information can be
determined with reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property on
which the building is located, the amount of expenses incurred by the city and
the balance due or alternatively, the amount of the penalties incurred and the
amount owing shall be sent to the owner at the last known address at the time
the lien attaches requesting that the balance due or amounts owing be paid
immediately. The lien is extinguished if the owner or any other person(s) or
entity(ies) having an interest in the legal title to the land reimburses the
city for its expenses or pays the amount of the civil penalty.
   (D)   Except as provided by §
150.20 above, the city's lien to secure the payment of a civil penalty or the
costs of repairs, removal or demolition is inferior to any previously recorded
bonafide mortgage lien attached to the real property to which the city's lien
attaches if the mortgage lien was filed for record in the Atascosa County
Clerk's Office before the date the civil penalty is assessed or the repair,
removal or demolition is begun by the city. The city's lien is superior to all
other previously recorded judgment liens.
   (E)   Any civil penalty or other assessment imposed under this section
accrues interest at the rate of 10% a year from the date of the assessment
until paid in full.
   (F)   The city's right to the assessment shall not be transferred to third
parties.
   (G)   In any judicial proceeding regarding enforcement of the city's rights
under this section, the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable

not be foreclosed if the property on which the repairs were made is occupied as
a residential homestead by a person 65 years of age or older.

violation. The City Attorney may further file suit in the proper court to
recover any expenses incurred by the city in vacating, securing, repairing,
removing or demolishing a building or relocating its occupants. Finally, the
City Attorney may file suit in the proper court to recover any civil penalties.

or lessee in possession of any dangerous building or structure who fails to
comply with the City Council's order and subsequent notice to vacate the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Tex. Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 10-1020, passed 10-21-2010)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 10-1020, passed 10-21-2010)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water,
sewer and gas mains, electrical and telephone lines, streets and bridges
located in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 10-1020, passed 10-21-2010)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 10-1020, passed 10-21-2010)

issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.

management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)

heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(Ord. 10-1020, passed 10-21-2010)
§ 151.33 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Appeal Board, as established by the community, shall hear and
render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
   (C)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
151.32(B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (§
151.03).
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria outlined in divisions
(A) through (I) of this section are met, and the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety.

been provided as set forth in §§
151.16,
151.31(H), or
151.47(C), the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to or above two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this division (A) as
proposed in §
151.32(A), is satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above 18
inches above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural
design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice as outlined in this division. A record of such
certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject

over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home
park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above 18 inches above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30,
AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
this division (D) of this section be elevated so that either:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above 18
inches above the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately

151.99
§ 151.48 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.16 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable,
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above 18
inches above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as
high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least
two feet if no depth number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures;
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above 18
inches above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as
high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least
two feet if no depth number is specified); or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base
flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
151.32 are satisfied.
   (D)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.

151.99
§ 151.49 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways, located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.16, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
151.45 through
151.49.
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the
provisions required by 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 10-1020, passed 10-21-2010) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this court
order and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court
order or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500 for each violation, and in addition shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall
prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.

meaning.
               MAJOR COLLECTOR. Drains 20 acres or more.
               MAJOR STREAM. Drains five square miles or more.
               MINOR COLLECTOR. Drains less than 20 acres.
            2.   Minor collectors shall be constructed with underground storm
sewers. If it can be established by certified engineering data to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that storm sewers are not physically
feasible, open ditches may be used, provided that the ditches are lined with
concrete or other permanent materials accepted by the City Engineer and
approved by the City Manager.
            3.   a.   Major collector drainage ways, detention ponds and
related structures may utilize either existing natural open sections which may
be modified, or newly constructed facilities. If modified or newly constructed
facilities are utilized, they shall be lined permanent materials including, but
not limited to: concrete or vegetation (see division (I)(2)(b)5. below for
special conditions and exceptions for vegetation).
               b.   Vegetated channels shall have sufficient grade to provide
velocities that will allow self-cleaning but will not be so great as to create
erosion. Side slopes shall not be steeper than three to one to allow for future
growth and to promote slope stability. All slopes shall be hydro-mulched,
sodded or seeded with approved grass, grass mixtures or ground cover suitable
to the area and season in which they are applied; on sand, slope shall be

October 1 and April 15, for each 1,000 square feet, six pounds Rye grass seed,
20 pounds of fertilizer (15-10-10 with magnesium and sulfur). On slopes add 40
pounds of cellulose fiber mulch and one-half pound of a soil binder. As soon as
practical after April 15, the April 15 to October 1 application described above
must also be made, provided, however, surfaces must be reshaped to original
configuration prior to the second application; Hydromulch growth must be
established over 85% of applied areas prior to acceptance of subdivision
improvements by the city, with no exposed area exceeding ten square feet.
ESTABLISHED GROWTH shall mean the vegetation has reached a height of one and
one-half inches and is of a density such that it can be reasonably expected to
be self-sustaining.
            4.   Major streams shall not be modified without consent of
applicable state and federal agencies and authorization from the Director of
Public Works and City Engineer.
            5.   If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, either conditions
such as drought, excess precipitation or extreme heat or cold are unsuitable
for hydromulching or sodding, the applications shall be deferred by the
developer. Under these circumstances, subdivision improvements may be accepted
upon the provision of a letter of credit in a form acceptable to the City
Attorney, in an amount of twice the City Engineer's estimated cost of the sod
or hydromulch application and where appropriate, surface reshaping, maintenance
and reapplication. If the developer is unable to meet the requirements of
division (I)(2)(e)3. above within nine months of subdivision acceptance, the
letter of credit will be drawn on and the proceeds used to obtain the required
vegetation cover.
            6.   The developer shall be required to use concrete or similar
permanent cover in lieu of vegetation if the City Engineer determines that
future maintenance is materially impaired or where channel bends and
intersections, flow dissipation or similar circumstances so warrant.
         (e)   Sedimentation controls. Brush berms, hay bales, sedimentation
basins and similar recognized techniques and materials shall be employed during
construction to prevent point source sedimentation loading of downstream
facilities. The installation shall be regularly inspected by the City Engineer

to be developed. The cost of water mains up to eight inches, or of a size
required to serve a tract being developed, whichever is larger, shall be paid
in full by the developer.
         (b)   Oversize; on-site mains. Where it is determined that an on-site
main needs to be of a larger size than that required to serve the tract to be
developed, the city may require the developer to install the oversized main.
For mains up to 16 inches the developer shall be reimbursed the incremental
cost difference required for over sizing from the oversize account approved for
capital improvement projects, or through reimbursement contracts. All
reimbursement contracts shall contain a provision terminating the city's
obligation to reimburse costs after five years from the effective date of the

         (d)   Oversize account. A special oversize account is hereby
established for the purpose of reimbursing developers for the cost of over
sizing water mains. The account shall be funded by a fee based on the number of
Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDU fee) to be added to the water system. The EDU
fee will be assessed to all developers regardless of whether or not they are
required to install an oversized line. In the event a developer is required to
install oversized line(s), the EDU fee shall be paid prior to acceptance by the
City Council of the utilities for maintenance. In the event a developer is not
required to install oversize lines, the EDU fee for that particular plat shall
be due prior to official recordation of the plat in the County Clerk's office.
In the event a plat is not required, the EDU fee is due when application is
made for a building permit. Interest income earned from this account shall be
added to the account.
         (e)   Reimbursement. To be reimbursed, a developer shall present in
writing to the Public Works Director, a statement of oversize credit proposed.
This statement shall be presented no later than the end of the normal working
day, eight days prior to the regular City Council meeting, at which time
acceptance of the respective oversize line is considered. The reimbursement for
the cost of over sizing will be paid from available funds within ten days after
the utilities are accepted by the city for maintenance and developers shall be
reimbursed according to the order in which the utility lines are so accepted.
In the event that sufficient funds are not available, interest will accrue at a
rate established by the Council. In the event two or more utility systems are
accepted at the same council meeting, the respective developers shall share
proportionally in the available funds. Provided, however, that no reimbursement
shall be paid to any developer who is delinquent in the payment to the city of
any fees or taxes.
         (f)   Oversize credit. In the event that there are sufficient funds in
the oversize account to meet all previous commitments, a developer may be
entitled to a credit against the EDU fee. Provided, however, no credit will be
granted to any developer who is delinquent in the payment to the city of any
fees or taxes. Subject to the foregoing, a developer may reduce the amount of
the EDU fee by an amount equal to the reimbursement to which he or she will be
entitled upon utility acceptance. In the event that the utility system has not
been completed and accepted by the city within three years from the date of
plat approval, the EDU fee shall be immediately due and payable.
         (g)   Determining EDU fee. Reimbursement rate and interest rate: each
December, or more frequently if necessary, the City Council shall review and
approve the EDU fee, a fixed rate of reimbursement per inch of diameter per
linear foot of oversized mains installed, and the rate of interest to be paid.

developed shall be paid in full by the developer.
         (b)   Oversize; on-site mains. Where it is determined that an on-site
main needs to be of a larger size than that required to serve the tract to be
developed, the city may require the developer to install the oversized main.
For mains up to 15 inches, the developer shall be reimbursed the incremental
cost difference from over sizing from the oversize account described in
division (K)(10)(d) below. For oversized mains in excess of 15 inches, the
developer will be reimbursed for the incremental cost difference required for
over sizing from the oversize account approved for capital improvement
projects, or through reimbursement contracts. All reimbursement contracts shall
contain a provision terminating the city's obligation to reimburse costs after
five years from the effective date of the contract.
         (c)   Oversize; approach mains. Where it is determined that an

tract being developed, the city may require the developer to install the
oversized main. Subject to review by the City Engineer and approval by the City
Council, the city may reimburse the developer for the incremental cost
difference required for the over sizing of approach mains. Upon City Council
approval, the reimbursement for approach mains will be paid out of the oversize
account described in division (K)(10)(d) below, from funds approved for capital
improvement projects, through reimbursement contracts or any combination
thereof. The manner of reimbursement shall be solely at the Council's
discretion. All reimbursement contracts shall contain a provision terminating
the city's obligation to reimburse costs after five years from the effective
date of the contract.
         (d)   Oversize account. A special oversize account is hereby
established for the purpose of reimbursing developers for the cost of over
sizing wastewater mains. The account shall be funded by a fee based on the
number of Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDU fee) to be added to the wastewater
system. The EDU fee will be assessed to all developers regardless of whether or
nor they are required to install an oversized line. In the event a developer is
required to install oversized line(s), the EDU fee for that particular plat
shall be due prior to acceptance by the City Council of the utilities for
maintenance. In the event a developer is not required to install oversized
lines, the EDU fee for that particular plat shall be due prior to official
recordation of the plat in the County Clerk's office. In the event a plat is
not required, the EDU fee is due when an application is made for a building
permit. Interest income earned from this account shall be added to the account.
         (e)   Reimbursement: To be reimbursed, a developer shall present in
writing to the Director of Public Works, a statement of oversize credit
proposed. This statement shall be presented no later than the end of the normal
working day, eight days prior to the regular City Council meeting, at which
time acceptance of the respective oversize line is considered. The
reimbursement for the cost of over sizing will be paid from available funds
within ten working days after the utilities are accepted by the city for
maintenance and developers shall be reimbursed according to the order in which
the utility lines are so accepted. In the event that sufficient funds are not
available, interest will accrue at a rate established by the City Council. In
the event two or more utility systems are accepted at the same Council meeting,
the respective developers shall share proportionally in the available funds.
Provided, however, that no reimbursement shall be paid to any developer who is
delinquent in the payment to the city of any fees or taxes.
         (f)   Oversize credit. In the event that there are sufficient funds in
the oversize account to meet all previous commitments, a developer may be
entitled to a credit against the EDU fee. Provided, however, no credit will be
granted to any developer who is delinquent in the payment to the city of any
fees or taxes. Subject to the foregoing, a developer may reduce the amount of
the EDU fee by an amount equal to the reimbursement to which he or she will be
entitled upon utility acceptance. In the event that the utility system has not
been completed and accepted by the city within three years from the date of
plat approval, the EDU fee shall be immediately due and payable.

§ 153.04 ZONING VARIANCES.
   (A)   Types of variances. For the purpose of this section, the following
types of zoning variances shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.
      (1)   Zoning variance. In accordance with Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 211.009,
zoning variances can be used to reduce any unnecessary hardship that a
landowner is experiencing despite the zoning ordinance having guidelines that
are in opposition to the intended use of the land.
      (2)   Zoning area variance. An area variance allows the property owner to
construct a building that goes against the physical requirements held within a
zoning ordinance and only the Board of Adjustments has authority to grant area
variances.
      (3)   Zoning use variance. A zoning use variance allows a landowner to
use the property or land in a manner that is typically restricted by zoning
laws (e.g., using a single family zoned property for multifamily purposes) and
only the Council has the authority to grant such variances. Under this chapter,
City Council may authorize and delegate authority to grant zoning use variances
to certain city staff including but not limited to the City Manager or his or
her designees.
   (B)   Authority to grant area zoning variances.
      (1)   Board of Adjustment authority to grant zoning area variances. In
accordance with the City Charter Section Article XIX Section 7 and Tex. Loc.
Gov’t Code §§ 211.008 and 211.009, the city’s Zoning Board of Adjustment may,
in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules,
conditions and safeguards set forth in the ordinances, make special exceptions
to the terms of the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purpose
and intent. Such ordinances may provide that the Zoning Board of Adjustment may
authorize variances from the strict application of the regulations in such
situations and subject to such limitations as may be set forth in ordinance.
      (2)   City Council authority to grant use zoning variances. In accordance
with the City Charter and state law, the City Council may grant zoning use
variances that grants permission to use property in a manner that is different
from that prescribed by the zoning ordinance under this chapter. Such zoning
use variances must not be contrary to the public interest. and the spirit of
the zoning ordinance must be observed.
      (3)   Staff authority to grant administrative use variances. In
accordance with the City Charter, state law and the provisions of this chapter,
the City Manager and his or her designees may grant zoning certain
administrative use variances through authority delegated and approved by the
City Council. Such administrative use variances may grant permission to use
property in a manner that is different from that prescribed by the zoning
ordinance under this chapter. Such zoning use variances must not be contrary to
the public interest, and the spirit of the zoning ordinance must be observed.
   (C)   Variance application. Applications for a variance may be filed by the
owner of property or an authorized agent upon recommendation of the Zoning
Commission, Board of Adjustment or City Council. Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 211.009
and §
153.04(B)(1) of this section establish the evaluation criteria for
consideration by the Board when reviewing and deciding upon requested variances
to the zoning ordinance.
   (D)   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   Generally, an appeal may be taken to the Zoning Board of Adjustment
by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, or board of the city
affected by a decision of the administrator under this chapter.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals that
allege error in an order, requirement, decision, or detennination made by an
administrative official in the enforcement of Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, Chapter
211, Subchapter A, Municipal Regulatory Authority, or this chapter.
      (3)   The procedure for an appeal under this section shall be in
accordance with Tex. Loc. Gove’t Code, § 211.010, Appeal to Board, this
division, and any applicable adopted rules of procedure.
      (4)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall decide the merits of the
appeal based on their findings of fact and deliberations. In any case where the
notice of appeal is accompanied by an application for variance, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall have the authority to grant, as part of the relief, a
variance but only in strict compliance with each provision stated in this
section or the Code of Ordinances.
      (5)   In any case where this chapter imposes conditions and limitations
upon any right, any such right granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment on
appeal shall be subject to such conditions and limitations in the same manner
and to the same extent as if secured without the necessity of an appeal.
   (E)   Residential development projects that do not require a variance or
permit.
      (1)   Permits required for new construction. Permits are required for new
construction, as well as work that changes, moves or repairs walls, floors,
ceiling, windows, doors, electrical, mechanical or plumbing.
      (2)   Permits not required for “cosmetic” remodels. For the purposes of
this section, cosmetic remodels include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   One-story detached accessory structures used as tool and storage
sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the floor area does not exceed 300

(Ord. 23-1314, passed 5-11-2023)
§ 154.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   No one may use public rights-of-way or other property in which the
city has an interest, whether in fee or easement, in a way governed by this
chapter without acquiring rights under the relevant section. Nothing in this
chapter requires a permit, license, or other document for utilities to place
their facilities in public rights-of-way as otherwise permitted by law.
   (B)   An instrument granting rights or permission under this chapter, or a
recordable memorandum regarding such instrument, shall be recorded in the
official public records of real property of the county in which the land is
situated unless it is a protected document not subject to public disclosure
under federal, state, or local laws. Petitioner must pay the recording cost. A
petition may be in letter form and must state the location of the affected city
property and the purpose and scope of the proposed use or disposition of the
property. The petition must further include such attachments and additional
detail as the director may require.
   (C)   An instrument may not be granted for uses or activities that would
substitute for compliance with another chapter of the city code. No right
granted under this chapter substitutes for compliance with the requirements of
another chapter of the city code. No grant of general right under this chapter
substitutes for acquiring a more specific applicable right provided for under
this chapter.
   (D)   Except as expressly stated, this chapter delegates no authority to
approve, without City Council action, leases and license agreements, including
renewals or continuations of rights previously granted, but nothing in this
chapter impairs a delegation of authority outside this chapter.
   (E)   Any city official to whom authority is delegated under this chapter
may further delegate that authority to subordinates. Authority to bind the city
to a contract may not be delegated below the level of director, unless the
delegation is made personally by the City Manager or a deputy or assistant City
Manager. All delegations must be in writing.
   (F)   Neither permits or licenses under this chapter create property rights,
and no permittee or licensee is entitled to compensation if the city revokes a
permit or license.
   (G)   All construction, excavation, and placement of utilities or other
facilities in public rights-of-way are subject to regulation.
   (H)   When fair market value must be determined under this chapter, the
following procedures apply:
      (1)   A director may require that an independent professional appraisal
be obtained. The city selects the appraiser and petitioner pays for the
appraisal. Except as otherwise stated in a particular section, independent
professional appraisals are of the fee simple interest in the affected land,
according to its highest and best use.
      (2)   Alternatively, in cases where the property is not developable, a
director may rely on an average of the per-square-foot Atascosa Appraisal
District-assessed land values in the vicinity.
      (3)   In choosing between requiring a formal appraisal or relying on
Atascosa Appraisal assessed values, a director should balance whether the
probable cost of a formal appraisal is disproportionate to the probable value
of the affected property. Streets and alleys must be appraised not as rights-
of-way but as if marketable fee simple title to the affected property were in
private hands and the city were condemning it for public-street right-of-way.
Appraisals of other strips or oddly configured parcels must not be discounted
because of the parcels' configuration.
      (4)   Independent appraisals should conform to the state licensing and
certification board appraisal standards as well as the Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practice.
   (I)   Those receiving rights under this chapter must maintain in good repair
and condition any structure, covering, or appurtenances and the accompanying
structural members extending over, under, or on public rights-of-way, drainage,
or utility easement, or other city property. No such encroachment may be a
nuisance or safety hazard. All such encroachments, when built or renovated,
must conform to the latest edition of the International Building Code and other
applicable building discipline codes, and installation must be consistent with
any city right-of-way ordinance.
   (J)   Grants of rights under this chapter do not relieve petitioners of any
other approvals, permits, or licenses that may otherwise be required. No permit
or license should be granted under this chapter if the proposed use would
impair the primary public purpose of the affected public right-of-way or other
city property.
   (K)   Driveways, bridges, and other ingress and egress-related encroachments
over drainage easements need not be licensed or permitted under this chapter
but all such matters are subject to review and approval by the floodplain
administrator.
   (L)   Before granting or recommending granting rights under this chapter,
the director may canvass some or all interested city departments, utility
agencies, and registered neighborhood associations in the vicinity. Based on
comments received, the director may impose or recommend imposing special terms
as a condition of approval.
   (M)   Nothing in this chapter governs use in the ordinary course of business
of park and recreation facilities, city cemeteries, airport facilities,
community centers, libraries, convention facilities, or leases or other uses of
city-owned or operated office or retail space, parking lots, and garages.
   (N)   Responsibilities allocated to a city department in this chapter
automatically succeed to any other department into which the designated
department or the relevant function of that department is reorganized.
   (O)   Nothing in this chapter impairs an otherwise applicable requirement to
seek planning commission approval of a proposed transaction.
   (P)   Except as may be specifically provided as to a particular fee, all
processing and other fees and charges provided for in this chapter are non-
refundable.
   (Q)   Nothing in this chapter repeals by implication or otherwise impairs
the effect of any part of the city code.
   (R)   The city has a lien against property of non-governmental persons
granted rights governed by this chapter until the sums owing under this chapter
are paid.
      (1)   The city may assert the lien by recording a lien claim in the real
property records of the county in which the property subject to the lien is
located.
      (2)   The property subject to the lien is all property of the person
making use of city property any portion of which is within 100 yards of the
unpaid-for use of city property. The lien extends to property beyond the 100-
yard limit, but only if it adjoins property within the 100-yard limit.
      (3)   Lien claims may be signed and acknowledged by the City Manager or
his or her designee without council action.
      (4)   The lien may be enforced judicially in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
      (5)   The lien applies only to sums owing for periods after April 1,
2023.
      (6)   This section does not imply that fees the city otherwise requires
to be paid up front may be paid other than up front.
   (S)   No petitioner seeking rights under this chapter may acquire such
rights before paying in full for all previously obtained rights of any type
governed by this chapter.
   (T)   Applicants seeking rights under this chapter are responsible for
providing any surveys required in an application prior to the application being
scheduled for City Council review. Applicants must pay for all costs associated
with such surveys.
   (U)   Upon receipt of a complete application or petition and associated
fees, the director shall process an application under this chapter.
Applications are valid for one year from the date of acceptance by the
director.
   (V)   The director may file a notice of expiration or non-compliance in the
official records of the county where property is located if a license, permit
or other instrument granting approval under this chapter expires or is
terminated and the licensee does not remove any improvements from the licensed
area or renew authority for such improvements to remain. Failure to file the
notice does not waive any rights to which the city may be entitled.
   (W)   Any provision of this chapter authorizing an expenditure of funds must
be supported and accompanied by (1) a prior appropriation approved by City
Council and (2) an unencumbered appropriated balance equal to or exceeding the
expenditure.

paid, in the United States Mail, first class postage.
   (D)   All properly filed appeals and protests concerning the approval or
disapproval of an application for a tower permit or the granting or refusal of

(Ord. 23-1314, passed 5-11-2023)
§ 154.07 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INSTALLATIONS ON CITY-OWNED PROPERTY.
   (A)   Use of city-owned traffic poles.
      (1)   Petitions for the use of city-owned traffic poles for the
attachment of appropriate wireless communication facilities shall be submitted
to the Public Works Director. The petitioner shall enter into a pole attachment
agreement with the city. The terms and rates of the pole attachment agreement
shall be non-discriminatory.
      (2)   The Public Works Director shall establish forms, processes and
procedures for carrying out this section. At the request of the director, the
petitioner will provide engineering network designs and other relevant
information in order to determine the most appropriate use of city-owned
traffic poles.
      (3)   A pole attachment agreement will not grant the petitioner the right
to use city rights-of-way. The petitioner must establish the legal right to use
city rights-of-way outside the scope of this section.
      (4)   When traffic poles on which wireless devices are attached must be
moved to accommodate a public works project, the petitioner will be required to
relocate the wireless devices and any related facilities at its own expense.
Upon termination of the pole attachment agreement for any reason, the
petitioner shall remove or otherwise dispose of the wireless devices within 60
days. Failure to take this action will result in considering the wireless
devices abandoned and they will become the property of the city.
   (B)   Fiber optic licenses.
      (1)   Petitions to install fiber optic cable, conduit, and related
communications facilities on city right-of-way or other city property must be
submitted to the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director may process
requests and may establish forms and procedures to carry out this section. This
section does not apply to a certificated telecommunications provider licensed
by the Texas Public Utility Commission that is providing local exchange
telephone service within the city and does not include public right-of-way that
is a drainage easement unless the city also owns the underlying fee interest.
      (2)   Fiber optic licenses have maximum ten-year terms.
      (3)   The annual consideration amount for use of public right-of-way for
the purpose of installing aerial and/or subterranean fiber optic and related
communications facilities is based on the fair market value of the right-of-way
used by the petitioner. The licensed area must be as wide as the petitioner
will reasonably need to maintain the licensed facilities but not more than 20
feet. The Public Works Director in his or her discretion may utilize internal
staff or engage an independent professional consultant to conduct an appraisal
of the right-of-way subject to the license, based on the appraised values of
adjoining properties as assessed by the Atascosa County Appraisal District. The
petitioner will be responsible for paying the right-of-way appraisal separate
from the processing fee. The Public Works Director will determine the fair
market value on a per-linear-foot basis of the right-of-way area associated
with the petitioner's network footprint. An annual escalation factor of 4% will
be applied to the consideration amount for year one in order to derive the
consideration amount for years two to ten of the license term. At the
discretion of the Public Works Director, the city may negotiate a discount off
the total licensing fee in exchange for in-kind contributions of equivalent
value.
      (4)   The licensing fee will authorize the petitioner to install fiber
facilities on city right-of-way, but does not grant authority to use poles or
other infrastructure of the city or utility agencies. The Public Works Director
may require a petitioner to sign and deliver an agreement setting out the
applicable license fee and conditions imposed by city departments and utility
agencies. When reasonably conducive to the efficient use of the property on
which fiber facilities are located, the Public Works Director may require
licensee to relocate the fiber optic facilities, including all related
communications facilities, at licensee's expense.
      (5)   Following termination of the license for any reason, licensee must
remove or otherwise dispose of all communications facilities at its own expense
within 60 days. Failure to take this action will result in the fiber facilities
being considered abandoned and the property of the city.
   (C)   Wireless communications towers on city property.
      (1)   Petitions for the right to erect a wireless communications tower on
city property or collocate antennae facilities on a wireless communications
tower must be submitted to the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director
may process requests and may establish forms and procedures to carry out this
section. Wireless communications leases and collocation licenses are for
maximum ten-year terms.
      (2)   The city may lease space for the erection of wireless
communications towers. When erected, wireless communication towers remain
personal property and belong to the provider during the existence of the lease.
The lease may specify the required height of the wireless communications tower
and the required number of antennae array locations. If following termination
of a tower lease for any reason, the provider fails to remove the wireless
communications tower within 60 days or otherwise dispose of the tower, the
tower shall be considered abandoned and shall become the property of the city.
      (3)   The provider shall reserve space for the installation of one
antennae array and related communications facilities on the wireless
communications tower for the city's use at no cost to the city for the entire
life of the lease. Petitioner's employees and contractors must wear a suitable
photo ID badge while on the premises, to be provided by the provider, which
includes a nominal one and one-half inch square personal photo, unique logo and
labeling that identifies the provider and the employee or contractor by name
and a telephone number where confirmation of employment may be readily
confirmed.
      (4)   Despite the wireless communications tower being the provider's
personal property during the term of a lease, the city reserves the right to
charge processing fees and the consideration amount to collocators desiring to
install antennae facilities on the city tower. If a wireless communications
tower was built before adoption of this section, the provider must obtain a
tower lease from the city, and any collocator must obtain a collocation license
for its antennae facilities.
      (5)   The petitioner must annually provide the city a list of all
wireless communications towers deployed by petitioner on city property,
including addresses, location, and GIS coordinates in a form approved by the
Public Works Director.
      (6)   The City Attorney must approve the form of each tower lease and
collocation license that does not conform to this section, both of which must
be approved by the City Council. The Public Works Director cannot bind the city
to tower leases or collocation licenses without specific City Council action.
      (7)   Validation of proper operation. Within 45 days of commencement of
operations, the petitioner shall provide verification by qualified experts that
the radio frequency levels comply with FCC regulations.
      (8)   The annual consideration amount for use of city property for the
purpose of installing a wireless communications tower is based on the fair
market value of the city property leased by the petitioner, including, but not
limited to, uninhabitable enclosed structures, all communications facilities
and related city property fenced in and enclosed therein. The Public Works
Director will determine the fair market value on a cubic foot basis (width x
length x height) of the city property area associated with the petitioner's
lease. The Public Works Director in his or her discretion may engage an
independent professional consultant to determine the lease rate. An annual
escalation factor of 4% will be applied to the consideration amount for year
one in order to derive the consideration amount for years two to ten of the
lease term. The city reserves the right to revise its rate structure based on
market conditions.
   (D)   Communications facilities installed on city property not addressed in
divisions (A), (B) and (C).
      (1)   Communications facilities installed on city property pursuant to
this section shall be by agreement negotiated by petitioner and the Public
Works Director subject to the City Manager's approval.
      (2)   The annual consideration amount for use of city property is based
on the fair market value of the city property used by the petitioner. The
agreement may include an annual escalation factor of 4% may be applied to the
consideration amount for year one in order to derive the consideration amount
for future years covered by the agreement.
   (E)   Interference with public safety communications. Whenever the city has
encountered radio frequency interference with its public safety communications
equipment, and it believes that such interference has been or is being caused
by the wireless communications infrastructure installed by one or more wireless
communication providers, the following steps shall be taken:
      (1)   The city shall provide notification to all wireless communications
service providers operating in the city of possible interference with the
public safety communications equipment. Upon such notification, the owners
shall use their best efforts to cooperate and coordinate with the city and
among themselves to investigate and mitigate the interference, if any,
utilizing the procedures set forth in the joint wireless industry public safety
"Best Practices Guide," released by the FCC in February 2001, including the
"Good Engineering Practices," as may be amended or revised by the FCC from time
to time.
      (2)   If any wireless communications service provider fails to cooperate
with the city in complying with the wireless communications service provider's
obligations under this section or if the FCC makes a determination of radio
frequency interference with the city public safety communications equipment the
wireless communications service provider who fails to cooperate and/or the
owner of the wireless communications facilities which caused the interference
shall be responsible, upon FCC determination of radio frequency interference,
for reimbursing the city for all costs associated with ascertaining and
resolving the interference, including but not limited to any engineering
studies obtained by the city to determine the source of the interference. For
the purposes of this section, FAILURE TO COOPERATE shall include failure to
initiate any response or action as described in the "Best Practices Guide"
within 24 hours of the city's notification.
(Ord. 23-1314, passed 5-11-2023)
RIGHTS-OF-WAY, REAL PROPERTY AND EASEMENTS
§ 154.20 CLOSURE, VACATION AND ABANDONMENT OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Petitions for closure, vacation and abandonment of public streets or
alleys must be submitted to the Public Works Director ("director") who may
process requests and establish forms and procedures to carry out this section.
   (B)   Petitioner must demonstrate ownership of each property abutting the
right-of-way and must submit at least a category 1B standard land survey with
field notes for each abutting- property owner's portion of the affected public
rights-of-way. All owners of abutting property must consent to the action under
this section. The consent must be in writing. The right of way will be presumed
to exist by easement.
   (C)   No fees of any type are owed for city-initiated closures, vacations,
or abandonments.
   (D)   The director shall provide notice of the petition to utility agencies
and may require a petitioner to sign and deliver an agreement setting out the
applicable closure fee and conditions imposed by city departments and utility
agencies.
   (E)   At least 30 days before the City Council takes up a proposed closure,
vacation, or abandonment the director shall cause signs to be placed at or near
the public right-of-way to be closed and shall send letters to persons the
director reasonably believes to be owners of all tracts within 500 feet of any
portion of the affected right-of-way notifying them of the proposed closure.
The signs must state the proposed action, the location and date of city council
action, and must remain in place until City Council acts on the petition. Signs
need not be erected, and letters need not be sent, for undeveloped ("paper")
public right-of-way or for slivers not affecting the path of public travel. In
determining ownership of tracts, the director need not inquire further than the
ownership listings by the Atascosa Appraisal District.
   (F)   Closing, vacating, and abandoning public right-of-way must be approved
by ordinance. After city council approval, the director may issue a document
indicating release of the right-of-way easement in the street subject to any
conditions included in the ordinance.
   (G)   An applicant petitioning for a street closure assumes all risk of
title as to the affected street or alley segment and as to what utility
agencies or companies may be using the segment. The city need not inquire into
these matters.
(Ord. 23-1314, passed 5-11-2023)
§ 154.21 SALE OR CONVEYANCE OF SURPLUS REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Petitions for the sale of all city surplus property must be submitted
to the Public Works Director ("director") or director responsible for the
disposition of city real property. The director will process requests and may
establish forms and procedures to carry out this section.
   (B)   The director shall establish a process for canvassing a proposed sale
or conveyance of city property.
   (C)   The City Manager may contract with a broker to sell property as
provided in Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, Ch. 253.
   (D)   Surplus status of real property may finally be determined only by city
council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission if applicable, and
only city council can authorize sales. All sales of property must conform to
law.
   (E)   A request to canvass a particular city-owned property for designation
as surplus for disposition purposes initiated by a department director shall
not be subject to a processing fee.
(Ord. 23-1314, passed 5-11-2023)
§ 154.22 GRANTING AND RELEASING EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Petitions for granting or releasing easements must be submitted to the
Public Works Director ("director") or the director responsible for oversight of
the easement. The director may process requests and may establish forms and
procedures to carry out this section.
   (B)   Any agreement under this section may impose limitations on the
proposed use to assure city and utility agency rights are not interfered with.
Owners of the fee underlying city easements need not apply for rights under
this chapter, provided that in no event may an underlying owner's use of the
fee impair or interfere with the city's or utility agency's easement rights.
   (C)   Prior to granting an easement, the director may require the petitioner
to demonstrate that the city owns the fee of the property for which an easement
is being requested and that no inconsistent rights have previously been
granted.
   (D)   The value of the easement to be granted on city owned property is
presumed to equal the fair market value of the fee, determined according to the
requirements of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter requires the city to
grant an easement, and if a person wants an easement from the city, the city
may negotiate for a higher price than the minimum described above. Petitioners
must remove all improvements in easements on city owned property to the
satisfaction of the director prior to recordation of the release instrument.
Petitions to release an easement on city owned property need pay only the
processing fee.
   (E)   If requested by the director, the petitioner must sign and deliver an
agreement setting out the applicable fee and conditions imposed by city
departments and utility agencies.
   (F)   Easements will not be granted when they would be inconsistent with the
city's use or planned use for the affected property and may be granted or
released, after acceptance, only with City Council authorization.
(Ord. 23-1314, passed 5-11-2023)

INDEMNITY PROVISIONS
§ 154.45 INDEMNITY OF THE CITY.
   (A)   Any permit, license, or agreement accepting rights under this chapter
automatically contains the indemnity contained in this section.
   (B)   These definitions apply to the indemnity provisions of this section:
      INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS. All loss, cost, liability, or expense, directly or
indirectly arising out of acts or omissions of any person other than an
indemnitee that give rise to assertions of indemnitee liability under this
section, whether or not the person is a party to this agreement. INDEMNIFIED
CLAIMS include attorneys' fees and court costs and include claims arising from
property damage and from personal or bodily injury, including death.
      INDEMNITEES. The city and its elected officials, officers, employees,
agents, and other representatives, collectively, against whom an indemnified
claim has been asserted.
      INDEMNITOR. Petitioner.
   (C)   Indemnitor must indemnify indemnitees, individually and collectively,
from all indemnified claims.
   (D)   If indemnitor and one or more indemnitees are finally adjudged to be
jointly liable for indemnified claim, indemnitor need not further indemnify the
so-adjudged indemnitees from liability arising from the indemnitees'
adjudicated share of liability. But despite allegations of indemnitee
negligence, the indemnitor must nevertheless defend all indemnitees until final
adjudication. Indemnitor may not recover sums previously spent defending or
otherwise indemnifying the indemnitee who has been adjudged to be negligent and
must continue to indemnify other indemnitees.
   (E)   There are no third-party beneficiaries of this indemnity other than
the category of people and entities included within the definition of
indemnitees.
   (F)   The indemnitor must promptly advise the city in writing of any
indemnified claim and must, at its own cost, investigate and defend the
indemnified claim. Whether or not the city is an indemnitee as to a particular
indemnified claim, the city may require an indemnitor to replace the counsel
indemnitor has hired to defend indemnitees. The city may also require an
indemnitor to hire specific-named counsel for so long as the named counsel's
hourly rates do not exceed the usual and customary charges for counsel handling
sophisticated and complex litigation in the locale where the suit is pending.
No such actions release or impair the indemnitor's obligations under this
indemnity division, including its obligation to pay for the counsel selected by
the city. Regardless of who selects the counsel, the counsel's clients are
indemnitees, not indemnitor.
   (G)   In addition to the indemnity required under this section, each
indemnitee may, at its own expense, participate in its defense by counsel of
its choosing without relieving or impairing the indemnitor's obligations under
this indemnity division.
   (H)   Indemnitor may not settle any indemnified claim without the consent of
the city, whether or not the city is an indemnitee as to the particular
indemnified claim, unless (A) the settlement will be fully funded by indemnitor
and (B) the proposed settlement does not contain an admission of liability or
wrongdoing by any indemnitee. The city's withholding its consent as allowed in
the preceding sentence does not release or impair indemnitor's obligations of
this indemnity division. Even if the city is not an indemnitee as to a
particular indemnified claim, the indemnitor must give the city at least 20
days' advance written notice of the details of a proposed settlement before it
becomes binding. Any settlement purporting to bind an indemnitee must first be
approved by City Council.
   (I)   Nothing in this section waives governmental immunity or other defenses
of indemnitees under applicable law.
   (J)   If, for whatever reason, a court refuses to enforce this indemnity as
written, and only in that case, the parties must contribute to any indemnified
claim 5% by the indemnitees and 95% by the indemnitor. Indemnitor need look
only to the city for indemnitees' 5% if the city is an indemnified party as to
a particular indemnified claim.
   (K)   This section controls whether or not petitioner's agreement with the
city so provides. This section controls even if the agreement provides
otherwise, unless an ordinance expressly states that City Council intends to
override this section as to the particular use by the particular petitioner.
   (L)   Entities that may not lawfully grant indemnities or may not lawfully
be required to do so by the city do not grant the indemnity provided for in
this section by accepting rights under this chapter.
