§ 50.04 EXTENSION OF MAINS FOR DEVELOPMENT.
   Developers shall extend water and wastewater mains to and through the
property that is to be subdivided or developed in accordance with the following
procedures and minimum standards.
   (A)   Size of mains. Water and wastewater mains shall be sized and designed
in accordance with the city’s water distribution plans and sanitary sewer
master plans.
   (B)   Extensions within property to be developed. All water and wastewater
mains shall be extended through or across the frontage of the property to be
developed in streets, alleys, or in easements to the tract or addition in order
to provide service to adjacent property where applicable.
   (C)   Acquisition of easements. The developer must obtain, at no cost to the
city, all off-site easements which are necessary for extending water and
wastewater mains to the property being developed. A metes and bounds
description of the easements and a drawing of the easement must be submitted to
the City Engineer in order for the proper legal document to be prepared. The
document will be sent to the developer for acquisition of the required
signatures. The executed document and filing fees will be returned to the City
Administrator for filing with the County Clerk.
   (D)   Agreement required. Prior to extension of any water main or wastewater
main for which there is a city oversize reimbursement, or any construction of
such a facility or appurtenances thereto, the developer shall execute an
improvement agreement with the city that clearly defines the scope and details
of the proposed extension and which contains the developer’s agreement to abide
by all regulations of the city and to deliver to the city clear and
unencumbered title to all proposed improvements prior to the time of acceptance
by the city. The agreement shall provide for security in a form approved by the
City Attorney.

Penalty, see § 50.99
§ 50.05 OVERSIZE MAINS; CITY PARTICIPATION AND REIMBURSEMENT.
   (A)   City participation policy. The city may participate in the reasonable
construction costs of oversizing water or wastewater mains and appurtenances
thereto that exceed the size of a water or wastewater main 12 inches in
diameter. The developer initially shall be responsible for the entire costs of
the oversize main. City oversize participation, if any, shall be in accordance
with
Chapter 155 (the subdivision regulations) and this subchapter.
   (B)   Funds; availability. In no event may the city be required to
participate in the costs of oversize mains pursuant to this section if the city
determines there are no funds available for those purposes.
   (C)   Participation and reimbursement requests. A request for city
participation authorized by divisions (A) and (B) hereof shall be initiated
through the submission of an application for participation by the developer in
accordance with
Chapter 155. The application shall be accompanied by as-built drawings showing
the reimbursable items, a copy of the contractor’s bid for construction, final
payments with quantities, oversize calculations for all reimbursable items, and
a project location map.
   (D)   City reimbursement. If the request for city participation is approved
by the city, following dedication and acceptance of a facility or appurtenances
in which it has agreed to participate, the city shall refund the costs of
oversizing the facility in accordance with the following procedures and
standards.
      (1)   Oversizing standards. The following standards apply to the
determination of the costs of oversizing water or wastewater mains:
         (a)   The size of a standard water main shall be 8 inches;
         (b)   The size of a standard wastewater main shall be 8 inches;
         (c)   Where the size of the water or wastewater main needed exceeds
that of a standard facility, the size of the main to be installed shall be
determined by the City Engineer, whose decision shall be final; and
         (d)   The city shall pay only the difference in cost between the
standard main with appurtenances and the oversized main with appurtenances as
required by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Oversize cost determination. The extent of the city’s participation
in the costs of oversized mains shall be determined by comparing costs computed
by the following 2 methods:
         (a)   Method 1. The developer shall take bids on installation of a
system using the standard size main and the larger size that will actually be
installed. Copies of the bids, tabulations, and figures shall be submitted to
the City Engineer. Calculations shall delineate the total cost for installation
of the oversize mains with appurtenances, along with the cost for installing
standard size mains with appurtenances, with the differences noted as
participation by the city; or
         (b)   Method 2. Periodically the City Engineer shall establish a table
of water and wastewater facility costs (“table”). The table shall establish
base unit costs used to determine the maximum difference in cost between the
standard size main and the cost of oversize mains likely to be installed, using
average costs of all water and wastewater mains installed in the general area
during the previous 12 months or by cost indexing based on data from
Engineering News Records, or other reliable sources. The then current table
shall be incorporated into this section as if fully set forth herein, and shall
be used to determine the city’s participation.
      (3)   City Engineer’s option. The City Engineer shall have the option to
use the method in division (D)(2)(b) whenever he or she considers the results
of the method in division (D)(2)(a) to be unreasonable or whenever the
developer fails to submit the proper information as required.
      (4)   Engineering costs. The city shall pay a maximum of 6% of the
construction cost for engineering fees, including surveying, construction
staking, and supervision.
      (5)   Street rights-of-way. A development shall be responsible for the
full cost of utilities which cross a street right-of-way, up to a maximum width
of 160 feet. A development on 1 side of the street shall be responsible for the
cost of utilities up to 80 feet in length. If the required street right-of-way
exceeds 160 feet, the city will assume the cost of the excess length of the
utility line as oversize participation.
(Ord. 458, passed 4-27-1999)
Penalty, see § 50.99
§ 50.06 EXTENSIONS TO INDIVIDUAL LOTS.
   For paramount purpose of health and safety, the city may extend a water or
wastewater main to individual residential lots. In these cases, each individual
lot owner shall be responsible for a pro rata share of the cost of the main
abutting the lot, as determined by the City Council.
(Ord. 458, passed 4-27-1999)
Penalty, see § 50.99
§ 50.07 PRO RATA FEES.
   (A)   Pro rata fees to be established.
      (1)   Nature of fee. A charge known as a “pro rata fee” shall be imposed
against all undeveloped property abutting an existing water or wastewater main
or for undeveloped property within the drainage area of a lift station, for
which that fee has been established pursuant to this subchapter, as a condition
of connection to that main or lift station, for the purpose of reimbursing the
city or the developer who previously installed or paid for the main or lift
station.
      (2)   Amount of fee. The pro rata fee shall be established for each side
of the main to which connections are to be made. The fee for each side shall be
equivalent to 1/2 the average cost of the standard size main, together with all
the appurtenances, based upon the verified costs pursuant to division (B) of
this section, for that length of the main abutting the property being charged.
For mains that can be connected to from 1 side only, the fee shall be
equivalent to the average cost of the standard size main, together with all
appurtenances, for that length of the main abutting the property being charged.
   (B)   Procedure for establishing pro rata fees.
      (1)   Request for pro rata fees. Prior to final acceptance of the
improvements, the developer shall submit a written request to the City
Engineer, stating whether a pro rata fee will or will not be established for
the main that the developer installed.
      (2)   Submittal requirements. The request to establish a pro rata fee
shall be in writing as designated by the city. The request shall include a copy
of the actual contract with unit prices. The request must identify the cost of
the main, including fire hydrants, valves, fittings, manholes, and other
appurtenances which were determined necessary by the city for the construction
of the line.
      (3)   Verification of costs by Engineer. The City Engineer shall verify
the developer’s calculations for the reimbursement. In the event of a
discrepancy, the City Engineer shall establish the cost per foot for the pro
rata fee.
      (4)   Reimbursement amount. The maximum amount for which a developer may
be reimbursed from the proceeds of pro rata fees for the main installed shall
not exceed the costs determined by the City Engineer under division (B)(3) of
this section, plus engineering fees, calculated at the rate of 6% of the
verified construction cost.
      (5)   Pro rata for lift station. In the event that a lift station which
exceeds the area necessary to serve a development is required pursuant to §§
50.03 - 50.06 of this code, the developer must submit a written request for
establishment of a pro rata fee for the lift station, which shall be on a cost
per acre basis. The costs eligible for reimbursement shall include the lift
station, force main, and other appurtenances, the other items included in
division (B)(2) of this section. The City Engineer shall be responsible for
approving the cost per acre submitted by the developer for the drainage area
served by the facility, as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
   (C)   Payment of pro rata fees.
      (1)   Obligation to pay fees. As undeveloped property begins the
development process, the pro rata fee shall become payable with either the
preliminary plat or the final plat approval. The fee must be paid prior to the
approval of the engineering plans for the development, by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Calculation of fee. The amount of the pro rata fee shall be
calculated by multiplying the unit cost determined in division (B) of this
section by the number of linear feet of that portion of the property boundary
of a lot which abuts a street, alley, or easement containing a water or
wastewater main for which pro rata fees have been established, or the per acre
fee multiplied by the number of acres in the development.
   (D)   Pro rata fee account. Two pro rata fee accounts are hereby
established.
      (1)   In the first account, the city shall deposit all pro rata fees
collected pursuant to division (B) of this section (from developers) into the
account. Expenditure from this account shall be earmarked for reimbursement of
developers for the reasonable costs of installing water mains, wastewater
mains, and wastewater lift stations for which pro rata fees have been
established pursuant to division (B).
      (2)   The second account may hold the city funds from all other sources
for related improvements, and funds collected to reimburse the city for
expenses described in division (D)(1) above which the city has paid.
   (E)   Reimbursement for water and wastewater main extensions.
      (1)   Reimbursement time limit. For a period of 10 years after dedication
to and acceptance by the city of the completed facility, the developer shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the proceeds of the pro rata fees established
pursuant to division (B) of this section up to the total cost of the
extensions, save and except the portion attributable to the cost of the
extension to the developer’s tract(s). Payment shall be from the pro rata fee
account. The city shall make reimbursements within 90 days after receipt of the
pro rata fee.
      (2)   Unclaimed funds. If the city is unable to reimburse the developer
who installed the main, following reasonable attempts to locate the developer,
the city shall refund all fees which remain unclaimed 10 years following the
date of acceptance of the water or wastewater main, together with interest
accrued, to the depositor of the fee. If the depositor cannot be located, the
pro rata fees shall be transferred to the water and sewer fund for expenditure
in accordance with general provisions.
   (F)   City collection fee. On all pro rata fees returned to the developer,
the city shall deduct 2% of the amount collected plus $100 as a collection fee.

(Ord. 337, passed 4-9-1991; Am. Ord. 345, passed 2-11-1992)
Penalty, see § 51.99
§ 51.17 SPECIFICATIONS.
   The following provisions and specifications are approved specifications and
provisions for water system construction in the city.
   (A)   Materials. All water lines shall be constructed of approved materials.
Main distribution lines and feeder lines shall be constructed of ductile iron
or AWWA C900 polyvinyl chloride pipe of SDR 21, 200 psi (minimum). Mechanical
joints, or a joint of the type which provides a recession in the bell for the
employment of a single rubber gasket to be placed before the insertion of the
succeeding spigot, shall conform to A.S.T.M. F 477.
   (B)   Size. Main distribution lines shall not be less than 8 inches inside
diameter, except where a main distribution line is proposed to serve a cul-de-
sac less than 400 feet with 6 homes or less, whereupon a 4-inch line may be
allowed, provided a fire hydrant is not required. Larger diameter pipe may be
required by the city.
   (C)   Surface markings. A suitable and permanent marking shall be approved
by the city and provided at ground surface level which will aid in locating the
position of main distribution lines, feeder lines, and cut-off valves. Surface
markings shall not be covered by vegetation or soil such that their location
would be hidden.
   (D)   Utility easements. Sufficient easements for the water system shall be
granted to the city for the purpose of serving the water system and for reading
water meters. Easements shall not be less than 20 feet in width. No permanent
construction, building, fence, or any other improvement which prohibits access
to the water system shall be located within the easement.
   (E)   Location. Main distribution lines, feeder lines, and water meters
shall be located within the utility easement. Main distribution lines and
feeder lines shall not be closer than 2.5 feet to the boundary of the easement
as measured from the closest surface of the pipe to the boundary of the
easement. Water meters may be located outside of the easements, but shall not
be more than 1 foot from the extreme point of the meter to the boundary of the
easement.
   (F)   Trenching. Trenches for installing water main lines shall be a minimum
of 18 inches in width and 12 inches wider than the diameter of the pipe. Water
mains shall be at least 42 inches below ground level. The trench bottom shall
be bedded with 4 inches of tamped sand or gravel. A minimum of 2 inches of
bedding sand shall cover the top surface of the pipe. Any person that installs
water mains shall be responsible for trench safety and stability.
   (G)   Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be installed as may be required to
provide that no structure is more than 450 feet from a fire hydrant. Standard
3-way fire hydrants, approved by the city, are required, with five 6-inch or
larger connections to mains with a minimum of 5-inch valve openings. Each fire
hydrant shall have a cut-off valve.
   (H)   Valves.
      (1)   Cut-off valves are required not more than 800 feet apart and shall
be placed in such a manner as to require 2 but no more than 3 valves to shut
down an area equivalent to 1 city block, or as many as may be required to
prevent shutting down any more than 1 fire hydrant.
      (2)   On cross-fed main lines without services, a maximum of 4 valves
shall be used to shut down each area equivalent to 1 city block. Valves shall
be placed at or near the end of mains in such a manner that a shut-down if
required can be made for a future main extension without causing loss of
service on the existing main. Valves of 12 inches or under shall be resilient
seat gate valves (RSGV). Valve boxes shall have a concrete pad around them for
easy location with the top of the valve box level with the final grade.

Penalty, see § 51.99
§ 51.18 INSPECTIONS; TESTING.
   (A)   General. Inspection of the water system shall be conducted by the City
Water Department staff. Several inspections are to be conducted as noted
herein. Proceeding to the next phase of construction, prior to the completion
of the inspection or approval by the City Water Department personnel, is
prohibited. The following on-site inspections shall be required.
      (1)   Easement site inspection;
      (2)   Basic installation inspection;
      (3)   Continuity test; and
      (4)   Final inspection and certification.
   (B)   Easement site inspection. The easement site inspection is to provide
the Water Department staff with a visual location of the water system easement.
The easement shall be located and clearly marked by certified surveyors. These
markings shall identify the boundary of the easement, the center line of the
water line, and the location of fire hydrants and cut-off valves. Location of
water mains shall be marked. These features shall be compared to the approved
copy of the engineering plans.
   (C)   Basic installation inspection. The water system basic installation
inspection shall be conducted upon the completion of all trenching operations
and the installation of pipes, cut-off valves, fire hydrants, water meter
boxes, saddle and corner blocks, and other equipment and features. The
inspector shall certify the water system with respect to location, adherence to
specifications, material, and other installation features.
   (D)   Continuity testing.
      (1)   The purpose of the leakage test is to establish that the section of
line tested, including all joints, fittings, and other appurtenances, will not
leak, or that leakage is within the limits of the applicable allowance.
      (2)   Normal operating pressure is usually applied for leakage tests.
Pressure should be maintained at a constant level throughout the period of
test. Measurement of the amount of additional water pumped in during the test
provides a measurement of the amount of leakage, if any.
      (3)   Air trapped in the line during test will affect test results.
Generally the project engineer will establish leakage allowance and indicate
methods and procedures for testing. If not, Table Z, below, may be used to
determine maximum leakage allowable.
      (4)   A properly installed line will normally show little or no leakage
using the methods described.
      (5)   A gross leak can usually be traced to a major problem (such as left
out gasket, dislodged gasket, broken pipe, loose mechanical joint bolts,
inadequate thrust block). Usually these problems are readily detected and
quickly repaired.
      (6)   A minor leak greater than allowable limits is frequently
frustrating and difficult to find and repair. The use of dye in the system may
be necessary. The best way to avoid this problem is to prevent it during
installation.
         (a)   Vent all high points; use a corporation stop if air release
valves are not required.
         (b)   Double and triple check all mechanical joint bolts.

an inability, presently or in the immediate future, to recover resources
sufficient to provide services necessary for the public health, safety, and
welfare.
(Ord. 439, passed 7-14-1998)
§ 51.74 AUTHORITY TO DECLARE EMERGENCY.
   Upon the recommendation of the Mayor and the City Administrator that an
emergency situation exists and that implementation of an emergency water
management plan is necessary to protect the public welfare and safety, the
Mayor is hereby authorized to declare that a state of emergency exists and to
authorize the City Administrator to implement the applicable provisions of this
subchapter.
(Ord. 439, passed 7-14-1998)
§ 51.75 PLAN IMPLEMENTATION AND TERMINATION.
   (A)   Determination of emergency. The City Administrator, after consultation
with the city staff, and if reasonably possible, a representative from the
North Texas Municipal Water District, may, based upon the criteria listed in
this subchapter, determine that conditions of a water emergency exist. Upon
that determination, the City Administrator shall advise the Mayor. The Mayor
shall, based upon the criteria specified in §
51.77 of this code, specify the appropriate stage of emergency that exists and
may order that the measures authorized under §
51.77 be implemented.
   (B)   General emergency.
      (1)   To initiate effective general emergency implementation of the Plan
in the event of a general emergency, the order must be:
         (a)   Made by public announcement; and
         (b)   Published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city
within 24 hours after the public announcement.
      (2)   The order becomes effective immediately upon publication.
   (C)   Geographical emergency or demand restrictions. Geographical
emergencies may include an area served by the city resulting in a demand for
water which lessens the overall pressure and supply of water to either an
unacceptable or dangerous level. Upon the recommendation from city staff, the
Mayor may determine that the supply to a geographical area may specifically be
restricted, including the regulation of specific water usage. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this subchapter, a water customer whose use is
determined by the Mayor to be high enough to create a negative impact on other
customers in the geographic area shall be ordered to reduce consumption
immediately. Any water customers affected by the order shall be provided
written instructions as to what the emergency restrictions shall be upon their
use of water until the emergency is abated. Failure to immediately follow the
written instructions of the city is a violation of this subchapter, in
accordance with this section. The restrictions for a geographic emergency may
be directed to an individual water customer, a homeowners association, a
developer, and any other customer or user of water provided by the city.
   (D)   Mayor’s absence. The Mayor may appoint the Mayor Pro Tem or the City
Administrator to take action in the event of the Mayor’s absence.
   (E)   Supplemental notification. Any number of supplemental public
notifications may also be utilized after an emergency is declared, including
notices posted at City Hall, the fire station, and publicized by direct mail,
television, radio, and other news media.
   (F)   Termination. All implemented actions remain in effect until the
condition(s) which triggered activation of those actions have been alleviated
or until the Mayor determines that the conditions triggering the emergency no
longer exist and advises the City Administrator. The Mayor may then order the
termination of emergency measures. The public will be informed of the
termination in the same manner as provided above in divisions (B) and (C).
(Ord. 439, passed 7-14-1998; Am. Ord. 523, passed 8-13-2002)
Penalty, see § 51.99
§ 51.76 DURATION; CHANGE OR EXTENSION OF STAGE OF EMERGENCY.
   The Plan is effective on a year-round basis. Upon the recommendation of the
City Administrator, the Mayor may upgrade or downgrade the stage of emergency
when the criteria identified in §
51.77 trigger such an upgrade or downgrade. Any change in the order must be
implemented in the same manner, and must meet all notice requirements
prescribed in §
51.75. The Mayor may declare any stage of the Plan specified herein to be
effective for a period not to exceed 90 days. Thereafter, the City Council may,
upon recommendation of the Mayor and the City Administrator, extend the
duration of the particular stage for additional time periods up to, but not to
exceed, 120 days each. The Mayor may terminate the particular stage in the
manner prescribed in §
51.75, when the City Administrator determines the conditions creating the
emergency no longer exist and advises the Mayor accordingly.

§ 51.86 WATER IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Actual and maximum impact fee rates.
      (1)   The actual impact fee rate charged by the city for each category of
capital improvements is set as follows:
         (a)   One-inch meter: $3,938.95.
         (b)   Two-inch meter: $15,755.82.

1) : $3,938.95.
         (b)   Single Family Residential 2-inch meter (living unit equivalent:
4) : $15,755.82.
   (B)   Determination of impact fee rates.
      (1)   The impact fee rates will be those in effect at the time an
application for a building permit, plumbing permit, or utility connection is
submitted to the city, except as provided in division (2) below.
      (2)   For development on property platted or replatted after the original
effective date of this subchapter, the impact fee rates will be those in effect
at the time the plat or replat of the property was recorded. The applicant for
a building or plumbing permit shall submit evidence of the date of plat or
replat recording with the application for a building or plumbing permit.
   (C)   Refunds.
      (1)   At the written request of an owner of the property on which an
impact fee has been paid, the political subdivision shall refund all or part of
the impact fee, together with interest calculated from the date of collection
to the date of refund, if any of the following apply:
         (a)   Existing facilities are available to serve the development and
service is denied for any reason;
         (b)   Existing facilities were not available to serve the development
when the fee was paid, and the city has failed to commence construction of
facilities to provide service within 2 years of payment of the fee; or
         (c)   Existing facilities were not available to serve the development
when the fee was paid, and the city has failed to make service available within
a reasonable period considering the type of facilities to be constructed, but
in no event later than 5 years from the date of payment.
      (2)   Upon written request of an owner of the property on which an impact
fee has been paid, the portion of an impact fee which has not been expended
within 10 years from the date of payment shall be refunded. The application for
refund under this section shall be submitted within 60 days after the
expiration of the 10-year period. Under this section, impact fees will be
deemed expended on a first-in, first-out basis. An impact fee collected under
this subchapter will be deemed expended if the total expenditures for capital
improvements or facility expansions within 10 years after the date of payment
exceeds the total amount of fees collected for the category of improvements or
expansions (water or wastewater) during that period.
      (3)   If a refund is due under divisions (1) or (2) of this section, the
city shall divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the
amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units identified in
the land use assumptions for the service area to determine the refund due per
service unit. The refund shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per
service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the
fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated on that amount. Refunds
shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time of the refund.
   (D)   Rebates. If a building or plumbing permit or an approval of a utility
application in a development expires after an impact fee has been paid, and no
utility connection has been made under the permit or approval, and a modified
or new application has not been filed within 6 months of the expiration, and
the property owner submits a written request to the city within 6 months of the
expiration, the city shall rebate the amount of the impact fee to the record
owner of the property at the time of the refund. If no request for a rebate is
submitted within this period, no rebate shall become due.

that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the city inspector may seek issuance
of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 785, passed 6-2-2020)
§ 54.08 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Warning notice. When the DPW finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the DPW may serve upon that person either a verbal warning notice or
a copy of the inspection report, with expected corrective actions.
Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice
in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this
division (A) shall limit the authority of the DPW to take any action, including
emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
warning notice.
   (B)   Notification of violation. When the DPW finds that any person has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder, the Code Enforcement Officer may serve upon that person a
written notice of violation. Within 5 days of the receipt of this notice, the
alleged violator shall submit to the Code Enforcement Officer an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of
reoccurrence thereof along with a plan of specific actions for compliance or
shall complete specific actions for compliance. The Code Enforcement Officer
shall have discretion to determine the amount of time needed for completion of
specific action for compliance if the latter option is chosen. If the alleged
violator denies that any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective
action is necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such denial or
contention shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer within 5 days of
receipt of the notice. The Code Enforcement Officer shall make a determination
within 1 day on the validity of the claim and shall notify the alleged
violator. Upon a denial of the claim, the alleged violator shall have 5 days to
complete specific action for compliance. Submission of an explanation and/or
plan in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the Code Enforcement Officer to take any
action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.
   (C)   Stop work order. Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer finds that any
operator of a construction site has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this chapter the Code Enforcement Officer may issue a “stop work
order”. This order will be posted at the construction site with a copy
delivered to the operator. All work at the site should cease until all
violations are immediately corrected, and documentation is presented to the
Code Enforcement Officer or his representative stating the violation will not
re-occur or changes to the SWPPP have been made. Upon receipt of the
documentation, a notice to proceed will be issued by the Code Enforcement
Officer or his/her representative. Issuance of a “stop work” order shall not be
a deterrent against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
violator.
   (D)   Consent order. The Code Enforcement Officer may enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance with
any provision in this chapter or any order issued hereunder. Such documents may
include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions
(E), (F), and (G) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (E)   Show cause hearing. The Code Enforcement Officer may order any person
who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or
any order issued hereunder, to appear before the Code Enforcement Officer and
show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall
be served on the alleged violator specifying the time and place for the
hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the alleged violator show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the alleged violator. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant
to the rights and procedures specified in this chapter. A show cause hearing
shall not be a deterrent against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the alleged violator.
   (F)   Compliance orders. When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that any
person has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or
any order issued hereunder, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue an order to
the violator directing that the violator come into compliance with a specified
time limit. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address
the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
city’s drainage system and waters of the US. A compliance order may not extend
the deadline for compliance established by a state or federal standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the person of liability for
any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a deterrent against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the violator.
   (G)   Remediation, abatement and restoration orders. When the Code
Enforcement Officer finds that a person has violated or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, and that such
violation has adversely affected the city’s drainage system, the waters of the
US, or any other aspect of the environment, the Code Enforcement Officer may
issue an order to the violator directing him/her to undertake and implement any
appropriate action to remediate and/or abate any adverse effects of the
violation upon the city, the waters of the US, or any other aspect of the
environment, and/or to restore any part of the city, the waters of the US, or
any other aspect of the environment that has been harmed. Such remedial,
abatement, and restoration action may include, but not be limited to:
monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of the adverse effects and determination
of the appropriate remedial, abatement, and/or restoration action; confinement,
removal, cleanup, treatment and disposal of any discharged or released
pollution or contamination; prevention, minimization, and/or mitigation of any
damage to the public health, welfare, or the environment that may result from
the violation; restoration or replacement of city property or natural resources
damaged by the violation. The order may direct that the remediation, abatement,
and/or restoration be accomplished on a specified compliance schedule and/or be
completed within a specified period of time. An order issued under this
division (G) does not relieve the violator of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of an order under this division
(G) shall not be a deterrent against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against any responsible party.
   (H)   Emergency cease and desist orders. 
      (1)   When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that any person has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and
that the person’s violation(s) have caused or contributed to an actual or
threatened discharge to the city or waters of the US which reasonably appears
to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue an order
to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing violator to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this
division (H) shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the Code Enforcement Officer may take
such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the city’s
drainage system or waters of the US, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility’s water supply sewer
connection, or other municipals utility services. The Code Enforcement Officer
may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Code Enforcement Officer that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in
whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measure taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Code
Enforcement Officer within 2 days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance
of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a deterrent against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
   (I)   “Red tags”. Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer finds that any
operator of a construction site has violated or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, or any order issued thereunder, the Code Enforcement
Officer may order that a “red tag” be issued to the operator, posted at the
construction site, and distributed to all city departments and divisions whose
decisions affect any activity at the site. Unless express written exception is
made by the Code Enforcement Officer, the “red tag” shall prohibit any further
construction activity at the site and shall bar any further inspection or
approval by the city associated with a building permit, grading permit,
subdivision plat approval, site development plan approval, or any other city
approval necessary to commence or continue construction or to issue occupancy
at the site. Issuance of a “red tag” order shall not be a deterrent against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.

considered as delivered.
      (3)   In a notice provided under this section, the city may inform the
owner by regular mail and a posting on the property that if the owner commits
another violation of the same kind or nature on or before the anniversary of
the date of the notice, the city, without further notice, may correct the
violation at the owner’s expense and assess the expense against the property or
issue citations. If a violation covered by a notice under this division occurs

name of the owner, if known, and the legal description of the property. The
lien attaches upon filing of the statement with the County Clerk.
      (3)   The city’s lien shall be a prior lien on such property, second only
to tax liens and liens for street improvements. The lien amount shall include

entry in the event that the DPW or the Code Enforcement Officer has reason to
believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair,
reconstruct, or discontinue the use of stormwater features and/or structure
BMPs; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an
obligation on the city to assume responsibility for the stormwater feature and/
or structural BMPs.
      (1)   Where an owner has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the owner shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the city will be permitted to enter without
unreasonable delay for the purposes of performing his/her responsibilities.
      (2)   The city shall have the right to set up on the owner’s property, or

owner at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The cost of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner.
      (4)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the owner’s
premises shall be a violation of this section.

stored at the vehicle owner’s or operator’s expense if it is not removed; or
         (b)   A conspicuous notice has been attached to the vehicle’s front

         (b)   That the vehicle was parked in violation of this section, with a

closed.
   (B)   Procedure for towing and storing vehicles.
      (1)   A towing company under contract with the city and that is insured
against liability for property damages incurred in towing a vehicle, and after
receiving authorization from the City Police Department, may, without the
consent of an owner or operator of a vehicle, remove and store the vehicle, and
any property on or in the vehicle, at a vehicle storage facility at the expense

division (A)(2) of this section.
      (2)   No later than the fifth calendar day after taking the vehicle into
custody for a vehicle registered in this state and no later than the fourteenth
calendar day after the vehicle is taken into custody for a vehicle registered
outside this state, the towing company shall mail a written notice by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the last address shown for the owner and
lienholder, if any, according to the vehicle registration records of the State
Department of Transportation or, if the vehicle is registered in another state,

         (h)   That if the vehicle remains at the storage facility for 20 days
or more after the date of the notice, unclaimed, the towing company will
declare it to be abandoned. The failure to reclaim the vehicle shall be deemed
a waiver of the owner’s and lienholder’s right, title, and interest in the
vehicle and their consent to the sale of the vehicle at a public auction to be
held on or after a specified date.
      (3)   (a)   Notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation
in the city is sufficient notice under division (B)(2) of this section, if:
            1.   The identity of the last registered owner cannot be
determined;
            2.   The registration has no address for the owner; or
            3.   The determination with reasonable certainty of the identity
and address of all lienholders is impossible.

and contain the same information required by division (B)(2) of this section.

entitled to receive from the owner, operator, or lienholder the expense of
towing and storage of the vehicle, including the costs of notification. These
expenses shall be a priority lien against the vehicle and may be deducted from
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction.
      (6)   If the vehicle is not reclaimed by the owner or lienholder, by
paying the full expense of towing, storage, preservation, and notification
within 20 days after the date of notification provided in divisions (B)(2) and
(B)(3) of this section, then the owner and lienholder waive all rights and
interests in the vehicle and consent to the sale of the vehicle by public
auction. In that event, the towing company under contract with the city may
sell the vehicle at public auction.
      (7)   The purchaser of a vehicle at a public auction:
         (a)   Takes title free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership;
         (b)   Shall receive a sale receipt from the City Police Department;
and
         (c)   Is entitled to register the vehicle and receive a certificate of
title.
      (8)   The towing company under contract with the city, from and after it
is authorized to tow the vehicle by the City Police Department as provided in

Department. The towing company is entitled to reimbursement from the proceeds
of the sale of a vehicle:

unclaimed by the owner or lienholder shall be deposited in the city’s General
Fund.

§ 90.02 ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES; REMOVAL AND DISPOSITION.
   (A)   The city is authorized to take into custody any abandoned motor
vehicle found on public or private property.
   (B)   The city or its duly appointed agent shall notify within 10 days by
certified mail, return receipt requested, the last known registered owner and
all lienholders of record that it has taken into custody an abandoned motor
vehicle. The notice shall be as prescribed by Tex. Trans. Code, § 683.012, as
amended, for abandoned motor vehicles. The notice shall specifically state, in
addition to the other requirements, that the failure of the owner or
lienholders to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within the time
provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner and lienholders of all right,
title, and interest in the vehicle and their consent to the sale of the
abandoned motor vehicle at a public auction to be held by the city.
   (C)   (1)   If an abandoned motor vehicle has not been reclaimed within 20
days after the date of notice and payment of all towing, preservation, and
storage charges resulting from its impoundment, the city shall sell the
abandoned motor vehicle at a public auction. Proper notice of the public
auction shall be given, and, in the event a vehicle is to be sold in
satisfaction of a garagekeeper’s lien, the garagekeeper shall be notified of
the time and place of the auction. Notice given in accordance with the
requirements of this code, or the giving of notice of the sale of other types
of abandoned property, shall be sufficient to comply with the requirements of
this section.
      (2)   The city shall furnish a sales receipt for each vehicle to the
purchaser thereof at the public auction. The proceeds shall be applied first to
reimburse the city for the expenses of the auction, costs of towing,
preserving, and storing the vehicle, and all notice and publication costs, and
any remainder from the proceeds of the sale shall be held for the owner of the
vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be deposited in the
special fund which shall remain available for the payment of auction, towing,
preserving, storage, and all notice and publication costs which result from
placing other abandoned vehicles in custody, whenever the proceeds from a sale
of those other abandoned motor vehicles are insufficient to meet these expenses
and costs.
   (D)   The city is authorized to apply to the State Highway Department for
authority to sell, give away, or dispose of any abandoned vehicle in its
possession to a demolisher in accordance with the provisions of Tex. Trans.
Code, § 683.051, as amended.

with a 5-day return requested, must be sent to the owner or the occupant of the
private premises whereupon the public nuisance exists. If the notice is
returned undelivered by the U.S. post office, official action to abate the
nuisance shall be continued to a date not less than 10 days from the date of
the return.
      (2)   The requirements of division (C)(1) above shall apply to the case
of a public nuisance on public property or on a public right-of-way, and the
notice shall be sent to the owner or the occupant of the public premises, or to
the owner or occupant of the premises adjacent to the public right-of-way,
whereupon the public nuisance exists.
      (3)   Where a hearing is requested by the owner or occupant of the public
or private premises, or by the owner or occupant of the premises adjacent to
the public right-of-way, on which such a vehicle is located, within 10 days
after service of notice to abate the nuisance, a public hearing, prior to the
removal of the vehicle or part thereof as a public nuisance, must be held
before the Municipal Judge of the city. It shall be the responsibility of the
city prosecuting attorney to prosecute the case on behalf of the city, and,
should the Municipal Judge find that the vehicle is a public nuisance as
defined herein, he or she shall enter an order requiring the removal of the
vehicle or part thereof from the public or private property or public right-of-
way where it is situated, and that order shall include a description of the
vehicle and the correct identification number and license number of the
vehicle, if available at the site.

§ 94.03 NUISANCES PROHIBITED; STANDARDS; DEFENSES; PERMITS.
   (A)   The foregoing nuisances are prohibited within the city. The standard
required for a nuisance would be that its effect upon the person complaining of
the nuisance is a person of normal or ordinary sensibilities. The foregoing
nuisances shall be presumed in violation of this subchapter if it is shown that
they take place within a single-family (SF), single-family transitional (SFT),
or planned residential development (PRD) zoning district within the city, or
that they have occurred within 2,500 feet of any home, school, or church
existing in an SF, SFT, or PRD zoning district of the city. Any act described
in §
94.02 shall also include the failure to take action to abate or terminate a
nuisance.
   (B)   It is an affirmative defense to a complaint filed pursuant to §
94.02(K) of this code that the property on which the alleged nuisance occurred
was an activity expressly authorized pursuant to a special use permit for the
property.
   (C)   A permit (a “553 permit”) to conduct activity which otherwise would be
prohibited by this subchapter may be issued by the Mayor on written application
to the city and payment of a filing fee containing information on the proposed
date, time, place, and description of the activity. The person(s) making the
application shall be personally subject to any violations of this subchapter
which occur as a result of the activity occurring in a manner exceeding the
limits established by permit. No permit issued under this division (C) shall be
valid for more than a 12-hour time period. A permit for an activity proposed
for a longer time period, or for more than 3 separate 12-hour periods, shall
require Council approval. Permits described in this division (C) are not
required of owners of property described in division (B).

94.99
§ 94.04 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Notice to owner. Should the city health officer or other designated
representative determine that a nuisance exists on any lot or parcel of real
estate within the city, written notice shall be given to the owner of the lot
upon which the nuisance exists. The notice shall identify the nuisance,
identify the property upon which the nuisance exists, and direct the owner to
take action as the city deems reasonable, appropriate, and necessary to remove
the nuisance. The notice shall be delivered personally to the owner in writing,
by letter addressed to the owner at the owner’s address as recorded in the
records of the County Appraisal District, or, if personal service cannot be
obtained, by publication at least once in the city’s official newspaper, by
posting the notice on or near the front door of each building on the property
to which the violation relates, or by posting the notice on a placard attached
to a stake driven into the ground on the property to which the violation
relates, if the property contains no buildings.
   (B)   Notice not required. The notice described in division (A) above is not
required in the event such notice has been issued to an owner in the preceding
6-month period for the same, or similar type of nuisance on the same property,
or contiguous or adjacent property owned by the same owner. A nuisance which
has been noticed, abated, and reappears during the 6-month period does not
require additional notice. Where additional notice is not required, a citation
may be immediately issued to the owner, or to any other person committing the
acts, commissions, omissions, conditions, or deeds declared to be a nuisance in
§
94.02.
   (C)   Abatement by city. If the owner fails or refuses to remove the
nuisance within 7 days following notice as provided in division (A) of this
section, the city may do or cause to be done that which will abate the public
nuisance, and may pay therefor, and charge the expenses incurred in doing the
work or having the work done or improvements made to the person who owns that
lot or building. If the work is done or improvements made at the expense of the
city, then the expenses shall be assessed on the real estate or lot for which
the expense was incurred. In a notice provided under division (A) of this
section, the city may inform the owner by regular mail and a posting on the
property that if the owner commits another violation of the same kind or nature
that poses a danger to the public health and safety on or before the first
anniversary date of the notice, the city without further notice may correct the
violation at the owner’s expense and assess the expense against the property.
If a violation covered by the notice occurs within the 1-year period, and the
city has not been informed in writing by the owner of an ownership change, then
the city without further notice may cause the work to be done or make the
improvements required, and pay for the work done and improvements made and
charge the expenses to the owner as otherwise provided herein.
   (D)   Collection of expenses. The Mayor, City Administrator, or city
official designated by the Mayor shall file a statement of expenses giving the
name of the owner, if known, the amount of the expense, the date on which the
work was done, and the legal description of the premises upon which the work
was done or improvements made, with the County Clerk. The city shall have a
privileged lien on the lot or real estate upon which the work was done, or
improvements made, to secure the expenditures so made, in accordance with Tex.
Health & Safety Code, Chapter 342, which lien shall be second only to tax liens
or liens for street improvements, and which amount shall bear interest at the
rate of 10% per annum, from the date of payment by the city. For any such
expense and interest, suit may be instituted and recovery and foreclosure of
the lien may be had in the name of the city, and the statement of expenses so
made, or a certified copy thereof, shall be prima facie proof of the amount
expended for the work or improvements.

   (A)   A person is subject to reasonable police power regulation of the city
to manage its public rights-of-way in connection with the construction,
expansion, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of facilities in the public
rights-of-way, pursuant to the city’s rights as a custodian of public property,
based upon the city’s historic rights under state and federal laws.
   (B)   These regulations include, but are not limited to, the following.
      (1)   At the city’s request, a person shall furnish the city accurate and
complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal,
maintenance, and repair of facilities performed by the person in the public
rights-of-way.
      (2)   A person shall be required to place certain facilities within the
public rights-of-way underground absent a compelling demonstration by the
person that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable,
feasible, or is it equally applicable to other similar users of the public
rights-of-way.
      (3)   A person shall perform excavations and other construction in the
public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements,
including the Engineering Division Detailed Standards for Public Right-of-Way
Construction (“Detailed Standards”), as may be revised from time to time in
accordance with the city’s police powers, and the obligation to use trenchless
technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with
obligations on other similar users of the public right-of-way. The city shall
waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field
conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by
the person. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way
shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and
private property. A person shall follow all reasonable construction directions
given by the city in order to minimize any such interference.
      (4)   (a)   A person must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by
applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation,
expansion, repair, removal, relocation, or maintenance of the person’s
facilities. A construction permit is not required for routine maintenance that
does not require excavation of the public rights-of-way or which does not block
traffic lanes or sidewalks during peak traffic periods from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00
a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays, or for more than 2 hours during
any non-peak traffic period between 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.; however, any
construction standards in the Detailed Standards shall remain applicable. Once
a permit is issued, the person shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours’
notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to
undertaking any of the above listed activities on its facilities in, on, or
under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the person to request and obtain
a permit from the city prior to performing any of the above listed activities
in, on, or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for
in division (B)(11) below, will subject the person to a stop-work order from
the city and enforcement action pursuant to the city code of ordinances. If the
person fails to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of issuance, the
permit shall become invalid, and the person will be required to obtain another
permit, unless extended for good cause by the city.
         (b)   A person required to obtain a permit from the city in the
paragraph above shall place a refundable cost deposit with the city as follows:
            1.   Routine maintenance: $500;
            2.   Minor construction (defined as excavation, construction,
installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation, or maintenance involving
a section, or aggregate total of sections, of 500 yards or less, in any 1-week
period): $1,000; or
            3.   Major construction (required when a person is otherwise
required to obtain a permit under this section, or any other section of this
subchapter): $2,000.
      (5)   When a person completes construction, expansion, reconstruction,
removal, excavation, or other work, the person shall promptly restore the
public rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A person
shall replace and properly re-lay and repair the surface, base, irrigation
system, and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be
excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or
repair of the person’s facilities within 30 calendar days after completion of
the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the
time of the work, unless extended by the city for good cause.
      (6)   Upon failure of a person to perform any such repair or replacement
work, and 5 days after written notice has been given by the city to the person,
and in the event repairs have not been initiated during that 5-day period, the
city may repair the portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been
disturbed by the person, its contractors, or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice
from the city, the person will reimburse the city in accordance with the
Detailed Standards within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice.
      (7)   Should the city reasonably determine, within 1 year from the date
of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation
system, or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet
existing standards of the city, a person shall perform the additional
restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies
as provided herein.
      (8)   Notwithstanding the foregoing in division (B)(7), if the city
determines that the failure of a person to properly repair or restore the
public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may
undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts, after emergency notice has
been provided, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances, and the person
failed to respond within the reasonable time specified by the city. A person
shall promptly reimburse the city in accordance with the Detailed Standards for
all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the
city invoice.
      (9)   A person shall furnish the city with the application for the
construction permits, construction plans, and maps showing the location and
proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least 5 business days
before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to
the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way unless otherwise extended
by the city. A person may not begin construction until the location of new
facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and
all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of
the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing.
         (a)   All plans submitted to the city shall be submitted both in paper
form and in electronic form in a format acceptable to the city (such as dxf
files and the like).
         (b)   Within 20 days of the completion of any use of the right-of-way
by a person for which a permit is required under this subchapter, the person
shall submit as-built plans to the city, in paper and electronic form.
      (10)   If the City Administrator declares an emergency with regard to the
health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or
abatement of facilities, a person shall remove or abate the person’s facilities
by the deadline provided in the City Administrator’s request. The person and
the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to ensure continuity of
service. If the person, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may
remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the person,
without paying compensation to the person and without the city incurring
liability for damages.
      (11)   Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent
harm to property or person (“emergency conditions”), a person may not excavate
the pavement of a street or public rights-of- way without first complying with
city requirements. The City Administrator or designee shall be notified as
promptly as possible regarding work performed under emergency conditions, and
the person shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the
restoration of the public rights-of-way.
      (12)   On an annual basis as of January 31 of each year, the city street
map in §
95.18(D) shall be updated with any new facilities from the previous year.
      (13)   The city may require reasonable bonding requirements of a person,
as are required of other entities that place facilities in the public rights-
of-way. The City Administrator or his or her designee may waive or reduce the
bonding requirements in a nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral manner,
taking into consideration both that the person has furnished the city with
reasonable documentation to evidence adequate financial resources substantially
greater than the bonding requirements, and has demonstrated in prior right-of-
way construction activity, prompt resolution of any claims and substantial
compliance with all required applicable building codes and ordinances.
      (14)   In determining whether any requirement under this section is
unreasonable or unfeasible, the City Administrator or his or her designee shall
consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the person
or persons to an unreasonable increase in risk or service interruption, or to
an unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable
delay in construction or in availability of its services, or to any other
unreasonable technical or economic burden.

§ 95.21 CONDITIONS OF USE.
   (A)   In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority
over all other users of the public rights-of-way. The city reserves the right
to lay sewer, gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to
do underground and overhead work, and attachments, restructuring, or changes in
aerial facilities in, across, along, over, or under a public street, alley, or
public rights-of-way occupied by a person, and to change the curb, sidewalks,
or the grade of streets.
   (B)   The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way
among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the
public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the extent
the city can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional
users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law.
   (C)   If the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the
surface of any public street, alley, or public rights-of-way, the grant to an
abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the previously authorized
user of the public rights-of-way. If the city closes or abandons a public
right-of- way that contains a portion of a person’s facilities, the city shall
close or abandon that public right-of- way subject to the rights of the person.
   (D)   If the city gives written notice, a person shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change, or alter the position of
the person’s facilities that are in the public rights-of- way within 120 days,
except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined
by the city based upon information provided by the person. For projects
expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, change, or relocate, the city
will confer with the person before determining the alterations to be required
and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has
determined that removal, relocation, change, or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance, or installation
of a city governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This
section shall not be construed to prevent a person’s recovery of the cost of
relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for
relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for
beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with the
person.
   (E)   If the person fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the
city in this section, the person may be subject to liability to the city for
that delay and as set forth in the city code or ordinance now or hereafter
enacted.
   (F)   Notwithstanding anything in division (D) of this section, the City
Administrator and a person may agree in writing to different time frames than
those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change.
   (G)   A person may trim trees in or over the public rights-of-way for the
safe and reliable operation, use, and maintenance of its facilities. All tree
trimming shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the
city. Should the person, its contractor or agent, fail to remove the trimmings
within 24 hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and
upon receipt of a bill from the city, the person shall promptly reimburse the
city for all costs incurred within 30 calendar days. A person shall not be
responsible for tree trimming or removal, except as to the work required to
construct, maintain, or restore utility service.
   (H)   A person shall temporarily remove, raise, or lower its aerial
facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures, if the
city gives written notice of not less than 48 hours. The expense of these
temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and
benefitting from the temporary rearrangements. The person may require
prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting the temporary
move.

Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.22 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A person shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably
prescribed by the city with an insurance company licensed to do business in
this state acceptable to the city. A person shall furnish the city with proof
of insurance at the time of the request for construction permits. The city
reserves the right to review the insurance requirements and to reasonably
adjust insurance coverage and limits when the City Administrator determines
that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the
industry or the person require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this
section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the
state or letters written by the person in those instances where the state does
not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein.
However, for the city to accept these letters, the person must demonstrate by
written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-
insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial
information requested by and furnished to the city. The city’s current
insurance requirements are described in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 480.
   (B)   The person shall furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of
certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section to
the city. The city may request the deletion, revision, or modification of
particular policy terms, conditions, limitations, or exclusions, unless the
policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the city, the
person, or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision, or
modification, a person shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to
accomplish the change.
   (C)   An insurance certificate shall contain the following required
provisions:
      (1)   Name the city and its officers, employees, board members, and
elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable coverage;
      (2)   Provide for 30 days’ notice to the city for cancellation, non-
renewal, or material change; and
      (3)   Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the City
Administrator by certified mail.
   (D)   The person shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the City
Administrator. An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this
section is subject to city approval. The city may require the certificate to be
changed to reflect changing liability limits. A person shall immediately advise
the City Attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop which may
affect an existing carrier’s obligation to defend and indemnify.
   (E)   An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required
insurance policies shall protect the person and the city. The insurance shall
be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies.
   (F)   The policy clause “Other Insurance” shall not apply to the city if the
city is an insured under the policy.
   (G)   The person shall pay premiums and assessments. A company which issues
an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium
or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a person must provide that the
issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the
city in connection with damage covered by the policy.

Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.23 INDEMNITY.
   (A)   To the extent authorized by law, each person placing facilities in the

city harmless from and against all damages, costs, losses, or expenses:
      (1)   For the repair, replacement, or restoration of the city’s property,
equipment, materials, structures, and facilities which are damaged, destroyed,
or found to be defective as a result of the person’s acts or omissions; and
      (2)   From and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of
action, and judgments for the following, arising out of, incident to,
concerning, or resulting from the negligent or willful acts or omissions of the
person, its agents, employees, or subcontractors, in the performance of
activities pursuant to this subchapter:
         (a)   Damage to or loss of the property of any person (including, but
not limited to, the person, its agents, officers, employees, and
subcontractors, the city’s agents, officers, and employees, and third parties);
or
         (b)   Death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services, or
loss of income or wages to any person (including, but not limited to, the
agents, officers, and employees of the person, the person’s subcontractors, and
the city, and third parties).
   (B)   This indemnity provision shall not apply to any liability resulting
from the negligence of the city, its officers, employees, agents, contractors,
or subcontractors.
   (C)   The provisions of this indemnity are solely for the benefit of the
city and are not intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or
otherwise, to any other person or entity.

Penalty, see § 95.99
§ 95.25 CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAWS.

effect on the date of passage of this subchapter to the extent that the code(s)
are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution and laws of the
United States or this state, subject to the city’s ongoing authority to adopt
reasonable regulations to manage its public rights-of-way, pursuant to §§
95.20 and
95.21 or as otherwise provided by law.
(Ord. 480, passed 3-21-2000)

no other penalty is provided shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to
penalties as provided in §
10.99 of this code.
   (B)   Any person, firm, corporation, or organization violating any of the
provisions of §
95.01 shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction in the
Municipal Court of the city, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed the sum
of $200 for each offense; and each and every day the offense shall continue
shall be deemed to constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 238, passed 7-15-1980)
   (C)   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions or
terms of §§
95.15 et seq. shall be subject to the same penalty as provided for in this code
of ordinances, as heretofore amended, and upon conviction shall be punished by
a fine not to exceed the sum of $2,000 for each offense; and each and every day

§ 130.03 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A MINOR; PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   Finding of necessity. The City Council finds that offenses against
federal laws, the statutes of the state, and the ordinances of the city by
minors under the age of 17 years are increasing at an alarming rate; that in a
great many of the cases, a lack of proper supervision and control of the minor
child by his or her parents or guardian is evident; that the increasing problem
of criminal offenses by children will not be solved by sanctions imposed upon
the children alone but that it is necessary that sanctions be imposed upon
parents whose neglect of their duty to properly supervise and control their
children is a proximate cause of the delinquency of those children.
   (B)   Contributing to neglect or delinquency of children. Any parent, legal
guardian, or other person having the care or custody of a minor child under the
age of 17 years who shall by any act, or by lack of supervision and control
over that minor child, encourage, contribute toward, cause, or tend to cause
that minor child to commit any delinquent or criminal act shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.

fined an amount not to exceed $2,000 for each offense; and each and every day
the offense is continued, and each and every time an offense takes place after

(Ord. 505, passed 5-29-2001)
Penalty, see § 152.99
§ 152.05 PUBLIC HEARING; CORRECTION OF VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   The City Council may by separate ordinance create a Building
Commission for the city, and may, by resolution, appoint a chairperson and
members thereof. In the event the city chooses not to create a Building
Commission, then the City Council may, pursuant to this chapter, act as the
Building Commission under this chapter, as follows.
   (B)   (1)   Notice of public hearing. Notice of the hearing may be issued by
the Fire Marshal or Building Official as set forth in §
152.04(D) above. If mailed, notice shall be deemed received by the addressee 5
days after placement of the notice in the U.S. mail, in a properly addressed,
postpaid envelope. Certified mail which is returned to the city “refused” or
“unclaimed” shall be deemed received by the addressee. Notice shall be mailed,
or delivered, to the owner(s), lienholder(s), or mortgagee(s) not less than 21
days prior to the date and time of the public hearing. The city may also
publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city, in
addition to written notice. Newspaper notice shall be published not less than
10 days prior to the public hearing.
      (2)   Public hearing. Testimony from the City Building Official, the City
Fire Marshal, and other fact witnesses may be presented regarding the condition
of the building. The owner, lienholder, or mortgagee, or other fact witnesses
may testify as to the condition of the building, the scope of any work that may
be required to comply with this chapter, the time it will take to reasonably
perform the work, and any other matter deemed relevant by the City Council.
      (3)   Findings from public hearing. The City Council, acting as in its
capacity as the Building Commission, shall make written findings of fact from
testimony offered, and shall determine whether or not the building or structure
constitutes a dangerous structure or building, or substandard building,
pursuant to the terms of this chapter. In the event the City Council finds that
the structure is in violation of this chapter, and does therefore constitute a
nuisance, the City Council may order that the building be vacated, secured,
repaired, removed, or demolished by the owner within a reasonable time as set
forth below. The city also may order the occupants be relocated within a
reasonable time. If the owner does not take action within the allotted time,
the city may vacate, secure, remove, or demolish the building or relocate the
occupants at the expense of the owner.
      (4)   Ordered action; notice. After the public hearing, if a building is
found in violation of standards set out in this chapter, the city may order
that the building be vacated, secured, repaired, removed, or demolished by the
owner within a reasonable time as provided by this section. The city also may
order that the occupants be relocated within a reasonable time. If the owner
does not take the ordered action within the allotted time, the city shall make
a diligent effort to discover each mortgagee and lienholder having an interest
in the building or in the property on which the building is located. The city
shall send to each identified mortgagee and lienholder a notice containing:
         (a)   An identification, which is not required to be a legal
description, of the building and the property on which it is located;
         (b)   A description of the violation of city standards that is present
at the building; and
         (c)   A statement that the city will vacate, secure, remove, or
demolish the building or relocate the occupants of the building if the ordered
action is not taken within a reasonable time.
      (5)   Alternative procedure. As an alternative to the procedure
prescribed in division (B)(4), the city may make a diligent effort to discover
each mortgagee and lienholder before conducting the public hearing and may give
them a notice of and an opportunity to comment at the hearing. In addition, the
city may file notice of the hearing in the official public records of real
property in the county in which the property is located. The notice must
contain the name and address of the owner of the affected property if that
information can be determined, a legal description of the affected property,
and a description of the hearing. The filing of the notice is binding on
subsequent grantees, lienholders, or other transferees of an interest in the
property who acquire that interest after the filing of the notice, and
constitutes notice of the hearing on any subsequent recipient of any interest
in the property who acquires that interest after the filing of the notice. If
the city operates under this division, the order issued by the city may specify
a reasonable time as provided by this section for the building to be vacated,
secured, repaired, removed, or demolished by the owner or for the occupants to
be relocated by the owner, and an additional reasonable time as provided by
this section for the ordered action to be taken by any of the mortgagees or
lienholders in the event the owner fails to comply with the order within the
time provided for action by the owner. Under this division, the city is not
required to furnish any notice to a mortgagee or lienholder other than a copy
of the order in the event the owner fails to timely take the ordered action.
      (6)   Filing and publication. Within 10 days after the date that the
order is issued, the city shall:
         (a)   File a copy of the order in the office of the Municipal
Secretary or Clerk; and
         (b)   Publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in
which the building is located a notice containing:
            1.   The street address or legal description of the property;
            2.   The date of the hearing;
            3.   A brief statement indicating the results of the order; and
            4.   Instructions stating where a complete copy of the order may be
obtained.
      (7)   Mailed notice. After the hearing, the city shall promptly mail by
certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the order to the owner of
the building and to any lienholder or mortgagee of the building. The city shall
use its best efforts to determine the identity and address of any owner,
lienholder, or mortgagee of the building. If a notice is mailed according to
this division and the U.S. postal service returns the notice as “refused” or
“unclaimed,” the validity of the notice is not affected, and the notice shall
be deemed as delivered.
      (8)   Correction required. If a building or structure is in violation of
the requirements of this chapter, the city shall require the owner, lienholder,
or mortgagee of the building to, within 30 days:
         (a)   Secure the building from unauthorized entry; or
         (b)   Repair, remove, or demolish the building, unless the owner or
lienholder establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be
performed within 30 days.
      (9)   Time extension. If the city allows the owner, lienholder, or
mortgagee more than 30 days to repair, remove, or demolish the building, the
city shall establish specific time schedules for the commencement and
performance of the work and shall require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee
to secure the property in a reasonable manner from unauthorized entry while the
work is being performed, as determined by the hearing official. The hearing
official shall be the chair of the Building Commission, or, in the absence of
the Building Commission, the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee.
      (10)   Time limit; exception. The city may not allow the owner,
lienholder, or mortgagee more than 90 days to repair, remove, or demolish the
building or fully perform all work required to comply with the order, unless
the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee:
         (a)   Submits a detailed plan and time schedule for the work at the
hearing; and
         (b)   Establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be
completed within 90 days because of the scope and complexity of the work.
      (11)   Progress reports; surety. If the city allows the owner,
lienholder, or mortgagee more than 90 days to complete any part of the work
required to repair, remove, or demolish the building, the city shall require
the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to regularly submit progress reports to the
city to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules established for
commencement and performance of the work. The order may require that the owner,
lienholder, or mortgagee appear before the hearing official or the hearing
official’s designee to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules. If the
owner, lienholder, or mortgagee owns property, including structures or
improvements on property, within the municipal boundaries that exceeds $100,000
in total value, the city may require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to
post a cash or surety bond in an amount adequate to cover the cost of
repairing, removing, or demolishing a building under this division. In lieu of
a bond, the city may require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to provide a
letter of credit from a financial institution or a guaranty from a third party
approved by the city. The bond must be posted, or the letter of credit or third
party guaranty provided, not later than the thirtieth day after the date the
city issues the order.
      (12)   Burden of proof. In a public hearing to determine whether a
building complies with the standards set out in an ordinance adopted under this
section, the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee has the burden of proof to
demonstrate the scope of any work that may be required to comply with the
ordinance and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work.
      (13)   Uncorrected condition; remedies. If the building is not vacated,
secured, repaired, removed, or demolished, or the occupants are not relocated,
within the allotted time, the city may vacate, secure, remove, or demolish the
building or relocate the occupants at its own expense. This division does not
limit the ability of a city to collect on a bond or other financial guaranty
that may be required by division (B)(11) above.
      (14)   Expenses; lien. If a city incurs expenses under division (B)(13)
above, the city may assess the expenses on, and the city has a lien against,
unless it is a homestead as protected by the State Constitution, the property
on which the building was located. The lien is extinguished if the property
owner or another person having an interest in the legal title to the property
reimburses the city for the expenses. The lien arises and attaches to the
property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the
office of the County Clerk in the county in which the property is located. The
notice must contain the name and address of the owner if that information can
be determined with a reasonable effort, a legal description of the real
property on which the building was located, the amount of expenses incurred by
the city, and the balance due.
      (15)   Privileged lien. If the notice is given and the opportunity to
relocate the tenants of the building or to repair, remove, or demolish the
building is afforded to each mortgagee and lienholder as authorized by
divisions (B)(4), (B)(5), or (B)(7) above, the lien is a privileged lien
subordinate only to tax liens.
      (16)   Hearing. A hearing under this section may be held by a civil
municipal court.
      (17)   Effort. A city satisfies the requirements of this section to make
a diligent effort, to use its best efforts, or to make a reasonable effort to
determine the identity and address of an owner, a lienholder, or a mortgagee if
the city searches the following records:
         (a)   County real property records of the county in which the building
is located;
         (b)   Appraisal district records of the appraisal district in which
the building is located;
         (c)   Records of the Secretary of State;
         (d)   Assumed name records of the county in which the building is
located;
         (e)   Tax records of the city; and
         (f)   Utility records of the city.

§ 152.06 ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO SECURE SUBSTANDARD BUILDING.

and occupancy of buildings in the city regardless of the date of their
construction. The city reserves the right to adopt additional ordinances as
necessary, if any, to carry out this section.
   (B)   The city may secure a building the city determines:
      (1)   Violates the minimum standards; and
      (2)   Is unoccupied or is occupied only by persons who do not have a
right of possession to the building.
   (C)   Before the eleventh day after the date the building is secured, the
city shall give notice to the owner by:
      (1)   Personally serving the owner with written notice;
      (2)   Depositing the notice in the U.S. mail addressed to the owner at
the owner’s post office address;
      (3)   Publishing the notice at least twice within a 10-day period in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the building is located
if personal service cannot be obtained and the owner’s post office address is
unknown; or
      (4)   Posting the notice on or near the front door of the building if
personal service cannot be obtained and the owner’s post office address is
unknown.
   (D)   The notice must contain:
      (1)   An identification, which is not required to be a legal description,
of the building and the property on which it is located;
      (2)   A description of the violation of the municipal standards that is
present at the building;
      (3)   A statement that the city will secure or has secured, as the case
may be, the building; and
      (4)   An explanation of the owner’s entitlement to request a hearing
about any matter relating to the city’s securing of the building.
   (E)   The city shall conduct a hearing at which the owner may testify or
present witnesses or written information about any matter relating to the
city’s securing of the building if, within 30 days after the date the city
secures the building, the owner files with the city a written request for the
hearing. The city shall conduct the hearing within 20 days after the date the
request is filed.
   (F)   A city has the same authority to assess expenses under this section as
it has to assess expenses under Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, § 214.001(f). A lien is
created under this section in the same manner that a lien is created under Tex.
Loc. Gov’t Code, § 214.001(n) and is subject to the same conditions as a lien
created under that section.
   (G)   The authority granted by this section is in addition to that granted
by Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, § 214.001.

information may be periodically changed, provided that the change shall be
effected by the replacement or interchange of letters, numbers, or other

relationship to the others, and that the combined area of those signs cannot
exceed the total square footage allowed when evaluated as a single sign. For
signs so constructed, where related portions are located on separate structures
or vehicles, the GROSS SURFACE AREA shall be calculated as the sum of all
portions and evaluated as a single sign. The GROSS SURFACE AREA OF SIGNS less

      (1)   The division of land into 2 or more parts where all parts are
larger than 5 acres and where no new building or improvement is proposed and no

jurisdiction the city now exercises or may exercise over these matters.
   (E)   Except as provided above, no land may be subdivided or platted through
the use of any legal description other than with reference to a plat approved
by the Council in accordance with this chapter.
   (F)   Except as provided herein and for lots of record established prior to
the effective date of the adoption of this chapter, no land shall be sold,
leased, or transferred until the property owner has obtained approval of a
final plat from the Council as required by this chapter.
   (G)   The city shall withhold all public improvements and utilities,
including the maintenance of streets and the provision of wastewater disposal
facilities (if any) and water service, from all tracts, lots, or additions, the
platting of which has not been officially approved by the City Council and for
which a certificate of compliance has not been issued pursuant to §
155.030(G).

parcel or tract of land inside the city limits until that property has received
final plat approval and is in substantial conformity with the provisions of
this chapter, and no private improvements shall take place or be commenced
except in conformity with this chapter.

PLATTING PROCEDURES
§ 155.025 GENERAL PROCEDURES; ESTABLISHMENT.
   (A)   Classification of subdivisions and additions.  
      (1)   Before any land is platted, the developer shall apply for and
secure approval of the proposed subdivision plat or addition plat in accordance
with the following procedures, unless otherwise provided by this chapter.
Subdivisions are classified as major or minor depending on the number of lots
proposed and the extent of public improvements required.
         (a)   Minor subdivisions shall create no more than 4 lots and do not
require the creation of a new street or the extension of municipal facilities.
Minor subdivisions may be approved for residential and nonresidential
properties. Minor plat approval requires the submission of a final plat as
described under §
155.030. The City Administrator may approve minor plats or refer them to the
Planning and Zoning Commission and Council for their action.
         (b)   Major subdivisions involve the creation of new streets, the
extension of municipal facilities, or the creation of more than 4 lots. Major
subdivisions may be approved for residential and nonresidential properties. The
procedure for approving a major subdivision plat typically involves 4 steps:
land study (voluntary), plat, final plat, and submission of as-built plans.
      (2)   Except as otherwise permitted, the Council’s approval of a
preliminary plat is required prior to the construction of public improvements
to the property. The developer may undertake efforts to improve the land, and
begin construction of public improvements after receiving approval of a plat.
Upon completion of detailed surveys and all necessary engineering to fully and
accurately define the subdivision, the developer shall submit a final plat for
approval. Lots may be sold and building permits obtained only after approval of
the final plat by the Council, and filing of the signed final plat. Upon
completion of the required public improvements, the owner shall submit a set of
as-built plans to the city. Certificates of occupancy for any permanent
structures shall not be granted until the as-built plans have been approved and
accepted by the city.
   (B)   Submission date for items requiring Commission, Council, or staff
approval. Plats and final plats will be acted on within 30 days by the Planning
and Zoning Commission and 30 days thereafter by Council, unless the time
requirements are waived by the developer. Minor plats may be processed in a
shorter period, since they only require staff approval. All other approvals
require the action of the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council. The
official submission date is the date of submission of all documents and payment
of all fees as required by this chapter.
   (C)   Statutory compliance procedure.
      (1)   Applications for plat approval shall be evaluated for compliance
with this chapter and requirements contained in the city’s standard
specifications manual and design manuals, which are incorporated herein by
reference, and with any other criteria, policies, rules, and plans which are
referenced elsewhere in this chapter, or established by ordinance.
      (2)   The City Administrator shall place the application on a scheduled
meeting of the Commission prior to the expiration of 30 days following the
submission date, subject to any waiver executed or agreed to by the applicant.
The Commission shall recommend approval, conditional approval, or deny the
application. In the absence of a waiver, if the Commission fails to approve or
disapprove (disapproval includes the identification of requirements to be
satisfied prior to approval) an application within 30 days of the official
submission date, or thereafter in the event of a waiver of time, the
application shall be deemed approved by the Commission as a recommendation.
      (3)   The recommendation of the Commission shall be forwarded to the City
Council, who shall schedule a meeting for the consideration of the application,
and the recommendation of the Commission. The meeting shall be held within 30
days of the recommendation of the Commission. The Council shall approve or
disapprove the application, or identify requirements which must be satisfied
prior to approval of the application. In the absence of a waiver, if the
Council fails to approve or disapprove (disapproval includes the identification
of requirements to be satisfied prior to approval) an application within 30
days
of the recommendation of the Commission, the application shall be deemed
approved, subject to the applicant’s waiver. However, the identification of
requirements by the Council, which remain to be satisfied prior to plat
approval, shall constitute disapproval of the application for purposes of
statutory compliance only. Unless the Council unconditionally disapproves the
plat application within that period, the city shall continue to process the
application for compliance with this chapter. The Council may table a plat, or
final plat, or may request the applicant to withdraw. These items must be
withdrawn by the applicant if the applicant is not ready to proceed. The
applicant may resubmit the project with no additional fees if it is rescheduled
within 30 days of the date of withdrawal. Tabling the application does not
extend the time periods required for action.
   (D)   Fees, application forms, and procedures. The City Council shall
establish a schedule of fees as required to recoup costs related to the
administration of this chapter. The City Administrator may establish
procedures, forms, and standards with regard to the content, format, and number
of copies of information constituting an application for a plat, replat,
vacation of plat, final plat, or as-built plat plans.
   (E)   Extraterritorial jurisdiction. Land in the city’s extraterritorial
jurisdiction is subject to platting, as provided by law. The approval of a plat
or final plat for land within the extraterritorial jurisdiction does not
constitute approval of land use. Properties incorporated subsequent to platting
are subject to the city’s zoning authority.

      (1)   Review of the land study is performed by the city as an
accommodation to the developer, and to the city, in an effort to identify clear
issues for further evaluation by the developer.
      (2)   No development rights are granted by the city through consideration
of the land study. The developer proceeds at his or her own risk and expense in
his or her applications for zoning, or preparation of plat and final plat
materials.
   (B)   Applicability. A land study is a voluntary submission by the
developer, and is not a requirement or prerequisite for processing plat or
final plats with the city. A land study may be submitted by the developer at
the developer’s option to determine the feasibility of the parameters of the
subdivision. Land studies shall be submitted for review to the Commission prior
to being submitted to the Council.
   (C)   Submission procedure.
      (1)   A developer who wishes to submit a land study for review by the
Commission or the City Council shall submit a request in writing to the City

placed on the agenda for the Commission after the developer has submitted the
written request and all applicable drawings. The review and discussion of the
proposed development shall be a Commission meeting or work session, and it
shall be open to the public. No rights are vested to the landowner/developer
regarding the land study or by the comments or suggestions of the Commission or
the Council. The landowner/developer proceeds at his or her own risk.

returned to the owner with the date of such actions noted thereon. If the
Commission denies the proposed plat, the applicant may request a hearing be
held by City Council within 30 days.
      (4)   Effect of approval. Approval of a plat by the Council constitutes
authorization for the City Engineer to release construction plans subject to
his or her final approval and for the City Engineer to authorize the developer
to commence grading of the site and construction of those public improvements
as are required by the city. Approval of a plat also authorizes the property
owner, upon fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval, to
submit for approval an application for final plat approval. Upon release of the
construction plans, the City Engineer may, upon request of the applicant, issue
a certificate indicating the construction plans have been released and
construction of the improvement is thereafter authorized. Additional
certificates may be issued by the City Engineer authorizing the construction of
private utilities on a phased schedule. The certificate shall read as follows:
      “The Plat for (insert name of the subdivision or addition) as approved by
the Council on (insert date of approval) is authorized for use with engineering
plans for the construction of public improvements as approved by the City
Engineer. A final plat will be considered for approval by the Council upon the
completion of all public improvements.”
      (5)   Lapse of plat approval. The approval of a plat shall be effective
for a period of 2 years from the date that the plat is approved by the Council,
at the end of which time the applicant must have submitted and received
approval for a final plat. If a final plat is not submitted and approved within
2 years, the plat approval shall be null and void, and the applicant shall be
required to submit a new plat subject to the then existing zoning and
subdivision regulations. See §
155.029 concerning extensions and reinstatement of approval.
   (D)   Phasing of development. The Commission may permit a plat for a major
subdivision to be divided into 2 or more phases, as indicated on the plat,
provided each phase satisfies the requirements of this chapter. In considering
phasing of a plat, the Commission may approve certain conditions as it deems
necessary to ensure the orderly development of the platted land. Those
conditions may include but are not limited to temporary streets, temporary cul-
de-sacs, and off-site utility extensions.
   (E)   Construction plan procedure and requirements.
      (1)   General application requirements. Construction plans shall be
prepared by or under the supervision of a professional engineer or architect
registered (if building is involved) licensed in the State of Texas as required

professional license number, and the designation of “engineer,” “professional
engineer,” “P.E.,” or “architect” and an appropriate stamp or statement near
the engineer’s or architect’s identification, stating that the documents are
for review and are not intended for construction. Final plans acceptable to the
city shall bear the seal and signature of the engineer or architect and the
date signed on all sheets of the plans and a statement that plans are for
construction. Public works construction in streets, alleys, or easements which
will be maintained by the city shall be designed by a professional engineer
licensed in the State of Texas.
      (2)   Review procedure. Copies of the construction plans and the required
number of copies of the plat shall be submitted to the City Engineer to be
reviewed for recommendation. The plans shall contain all necessary information
for construction of the project. All materials specified shall conform to the
standard specifications and standard details of the city. Each sheet of the
plans shall contain a title block including space for the notation of
revisions. This space is to be completed with each revision to the plan sheet
and shall clearly note the nature of the revision and the date the revision was
made. The City Administrator will release the plans for construction, after the
plans are recommended for approval by the City Engineer, and approval of the
final plat by the Council and payment of all fees. Upon this release, each
contractor shall maintain 1 set of plans stamped with the city approval on the
project site at all times during construction. (Also see §§ 155.046 and
155.047.)

applicant and the city, or as may be required by this division (J).
      (2)   Agreement to run with the land. The subdivision improvement
agreement shall provide that the covenants and other items of agreement
contained therein shall run with the land and shall bind all successors, heirs
and assignees of the applicant. All existing owners shall be required to
execute the subdivision improvement agreement or otherwise provide written
consent to the covenants and other items contained in the subdivision
improvement agreement.
      (3)   Approval by Council. The Council shall review the subdivision
improvement agreement, and shall approve it, approve it with conditions, or
deny it. The subdivision improvement agreement shall also be subject to review
by the City Attorney, and the applicant shall reimburse the city for all
related legal costs for review. This reimbursement shall be paid in full prior
to filing of the final plat.
      (4)   Security for completion of improvements.
         (a)   Type of security. When any of the required public improvements
will be constructed after approval and recordation of the final plat, the
applicant shall guarantee proper construction of such postponed improvements,
in accordance with the city’s design criteria and construction standards and
with this division (J), by either:
            1.   A bond executed by a surety company holding a license to do
business in the State of Texas, and acceptable to the city, on the form
provided by the city;
            2.   A letter of credit that is (A) irrevocable; (B) for a term
sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods in this
section; and (C) require only that the city present the letter of credit with a
sight draft and an affidavit signed by the City Attorney attesting to the
city’s right to draw funds under the letter of credit; or
            3.   A cash escrow with escrow instructions that provide: (A) that
the applicant will have no right to a return of any of the funds except upon
actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the
ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted
bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision; and (B)
that the escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the city
whenever the City Attorney presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the
city’s right to receive funds whether or not the applicant protests that right.
         (b)   Estimated cost and security approval. Security shall be issued
in the amount of 110% of the cost to construct and complete all required public
improvements to the city’s standards as estimated by the applicant’s
professional engineer, and as approved by the City Administrator and City
Engineer. Security shall be subject to the review and approval of the City
Attorney. The applicant shall reimburse the city for all related legal costs
for review (this reimbursement shall be paid in full prior to filing of the
final plat).
         (c)   Security for construction in extraterritorial jurisdiction
(ETJ). Where all or some portion of the proposed development is located in the
city’s ETJ, the security shall be in a form and shall contain such terms as are
consistent with the city’s interlocal agreements with Collin County under
V.T.C.A., Local Government Code Ch. 242. In cases where the requirements
governing the form and terms of the security are defined in such an agreement,
they will supersede any conflicting provisions within this division (J).

IMPROVEMENTS; PROCEDURES, STANDARDS, AND REQUIREMENTS
§ 155.045 COMPLETION, ACCEPTANCE, AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Completion of improvements.  
      (1)   Except as provided below, before the final plat is signed by the
Mayor, all applicants shall be required to complete, in accordance with the
city’s decision and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street,
utility, erosion control, vegetation established, and other public
improvements, as well as lot improvements on the individual residential lots of
the subdivision or addition as required in this chapter, specified in the final
plat, and as approved by the Commission, and to dedicate those public
improvements to the city.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         LOT IMPROVEMENTS. Include grading and installation of improvements
required for proper drainage and control of soil erosion.
   (B)   Temporary improvements. The developer shall build and pay for all
costs of temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain
those temporary improvements for the period specified by the Council.
   (C)   Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall require both
the recommendation of the City Engineer and separate and specific action by the
Council. A plat or final plat, shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the
acceptance by the city of any street, easement, or park shown on that plat. The
Council may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this
effect. The dedication of a drainage easement to the city does not indicate or
signify that the city accepts any duty to maintain the easement, absent a
specific notation on the plat that the city will maintain the easement. Without
this specific notation, the property owner will maintain the easement. (See §
155.054)
   (D)   Maintenance and guarantee of public improvements. The developer shall
maintain all required public improvements for a period of 2 years following the
acceptance by the city and shall provide a warranty that all public
improvements will be free from defect for a period of 2 years following the
acceptance by the city. The maintenance bond shall be not less than 100% of
construction costs.

§ 155.047 INSPECTION.
   (A)   General procedure. Construction inspection shall be supervised by the
city staff and City Engineer. Construction shall be in accordance with the
city’s approved plans, and the standards and specifications of the city. Any
change in design required during construction should be made by the engineer
whose seal and signature are shown on the plans and approved by the city. All
revisions shall be approved by the City Engineer. If the City Engineer finds
upon inspection that any of the required public improvements have not be
constructed in accordance with the city’s construction standards and
specifications, the property owner shall be responsible for completing or
correcting the public improvements.
   (B)   Certificate of satisfactory completion.  
      (1)   Prior to the city accepting dedication of required public
improvements, the applicant’s engineer or surveyor shall certify to the City
Administrator, through submission of a detailed as-built construction drawing
of the property, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other
information required by the Commission or City Administrator, that all required
public improvements have been completed. The as-built construction drawing
shall include a complete set of drawings of the paving, drainage, water,
sanitary sewer, or other public improvements, both onsite and offsite, showing
that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in
accordance with construction plans for the plat, and all changes made in the
plans during construction, and containing on each sheet an as-built stamp
bearing the signature of the engineer and the date. Digital plans shall be
provided in a form required by the City Engineer (PDF or TIFF). In addition, 3
reproducible drawings 22 x 34 inch and one 11 x 17 copy of the utility plan
sheets containing the as-built information shall be submitted.
      (2)   The engineer or surveyor shall also furnish a copy of the final
plat and engineering plans, in a format that is compatible with the city’s CADD
or GIS system (PDF or TIFF). When these requirements have been met, the City
Engineer, on behalf of the city, shall thereafter accept the public
improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure.
      (3)   Acceptance of the development shall mean that the developer has
transferred all ownership and rights to all the public improvements to the city
for use and maintenance. The City Engineer may, at his or her decision, accept
dedication of a portion of the required public improvements, if the remaining
public improvements are not required for health and safety reasons and the
owner has posted security in accordance with §
155.027 of this chapter in the amount of 100% of the estimated cost as
determined by the City Engineer of those remaining improvements for a length of
time to be determined by the City Engineer. If the remaining public
improvements are greater than $10,000 and are not completed within the
determined length of time, the city will impose a penalty of 10% of the secured
amount. The obligation to complete the improvements remains with the developer,
and all future building permits or certificates of occupancy will be withheld
until the improvements are complete. If the remaining public improvements are
less than $10,000, the developer shall pay the actual dollar amount. The length
of time may be extended due to inclement weather or unforeseen delays by mutual
agreement between the developer and the city.
      (4)   Upon acceptance of the required public improvements, the City
Engineer shall submit a certificate to the developer stating that all required
public improvements have been satisfactorily completed.

§ 155.049 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Plats straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision or addition is required across land in another municipality, the
Council may request assurance from that municipality’s attorney that access is
legally established, and from its engineer that the access road is adequately
improved, or that a bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to
ensure the construction of the access road. In general, lot lines should be
drawn so as not to cross municipal, county, or school district boundary lines.
   (B)   Adequate public facilities policy. The land proposed for subdivision
shall be adequately served by essential public facilities and services. These
services include street access, water, and drainage. No plat or replat may be
approved unless it conforms to this policy and its standards. This policy may
be further defined and supplemented by other ordinances adopted by the city.
      (1)   Street access. All platted lots shall have safe and reliable street
access for daily use and emergency purposes.
         (a)   All platted lots shall have direct access to an improved public
street, private street, or an approved public way, and connected by improved
public streets to an improved public thoroughfare.
         (b)   All subdivisions shall have 2 means of access or approach. Where
development phasing or constraints of the land prevent the provision of a
second, separate means of access, the city may accept a temporary street
connection, or a median divided street or entry to satisfy this requirement. In
some situations, provisions for street extensions on adjacent property at a
future date may be acceptable.
      (2)   Water. All platted lots shall be connected to a public water system
which is capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes.
         (a)   All lots shall be provided service connections from a looped
water main providing water flow from 2 directions or sources.
         (b)   Water service shall be sufficient to meet the fire flow
requirements of the proposed development, except where a suitable alternative
means of fire protection is approved by the City Fire Chief.
         (c)   The city may accept development phasing, development
restrictions, or the construction of improvements to maintain adequate fire
protection.
      (3)   Wastewater. On-site systems shall be designed and constructed
according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Construction
Standards for On-Site Wastewater Facilities, and the requirements of the
county, and special provisions of the city, if any. The construction plans
shall contain data and typical design criteria of the system for on-site
disposal of wastewater. Public wastewater removal, for those lots not meeting
county standards allowing on-site systems, shall conform to TCEQ and county
standards, and special provisions of the city, if any. The city adopts TCEQ and
county regulations regarding wastewater as a part of this chapter. The more
restrictive of the 2 regulations shall apply.
      (4)   Drainage. Increased storm water run-off attributable to new
development shall not exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system or
adversely affect adjoining property. Where the projected run-off would exceed
capacity, the city may accept the phasing of development, the use of control
methods such as retention or detention, or the construction by the developer of
off- site drainage improvements as means of mitigation. An enclosed storm sewer
system, designed to properly accommodate the run-off from a storm event of 100-
year frequency, shall be provided in all areas where density is greater than or
equal to 2 units per gross acre.
   (C)   Subdivision or addition name. The proposed name of the subdivision or
addition shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name
of any other subdivision or addition in the area covered by this chapter and
shall, where possible, correspond to named subdivisions or additions in the
immediate vicinity. The Council shall have final authority to approve the name
of the subdivision or addition.
   (D)   Corner and reference markers.
      (1)   All lot corners shall be located and marked with 1/2-inch
reinforcing bar, 18 inches in length, and shall be placed flush with the ground
or counter sunk, if necessary, in order to avoid being disturbed.
      (2)   Iron rods, 1 inch in diameter and 18 inches long, shall be placed
on all boundary corners, block corners, angle points, points of corners, and
points of tangents in public rights-of-way. Monuments in accordance with city
Construction Details shall be located as required by the City Engineer and
shall be located along all drainage and floodway boundaries.

§ 155.050 LOT DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with Chapters
151 and
156 of this code, and other applicable ordinances, laws, and regulations.
Driveway access shall be provided to residential structures and detached
garages on the lots from an approved street or public way.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of
Chapter 156. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street
lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule
will give a better street or lot plan. Depth and width of properties reserved
or laid out for business purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street parking, landscaping, and loading facilities required for the type of
use and development contemplated, as established in
Chapter 156, and provided those uses are allowed by ordinance.
   (C)   Double frontage residential lots. Double frontage lots shall be
avoided except where necessary to separate residential development from traffic
arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
   (D)   Blocks. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated.
   (E)   Soil preservation and final grading. Top soil shall not be removed
from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to
provide at least 6 inches of cover on the lots and parkways. Top soil may need
to be imported to obtain 6 inches of depth on each lot. Permanent erosion
control measures, such as grassed parkways, shall be established throughout the
development prior to final acceptance of the improvements. All areas disturbed
during the construction process shall be revegetated and regraded as necessary.
   (F)   Lot grading and drainage. Drainage for lots shall be designed in
accordance with the city’s requirements. Lots shall be laid out so as to
provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage
shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water
from each lot to adjacent lots. The land shall be platted with appropriate
regard for all topographical and drainage features and shall minimize the use
of retaining walls. A grading plan shall be provided with contours at an
interval of 0.5 foot or less. Grading plans shall show existing and design
contours.
   (G)   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, large rocks or stones,
junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any
land, or left or deposited on any lot or street for longer than 60 calendar
days or at the time of final acceptance by the City Engineer, and removal of
those items and materials shall be required prior to that acceptance. No items
and materials as herein described shall be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision or addition at the time of acceptance of dedication of public
improvements. However, soil for redistribution may be stockpiled with
appropriate erosion control measures on a property with approval of the City
Engineer.

   (A)   No use in any district, or the extraterritorial jurisdiction, shall be
operated so as to produce intense glare or direct illumination across the
boundary property line from a visible source of illumination of such intensity
as to create a nuisance or detract from the use or enjoyment of the adjacent
property. All outside lights shall be designed with a light source and
reflector so selected that acting together the light beam is controlled and not
directed across any bounding property line. With the exception of street lights
owned and operated by the city, the maximum allowable intensity of light
measured at the property line shall not exceed 1 foot candle.
   (B)   A light pole, and height of the light fixture, shall not exceed 20
feet above grade, without a special use permit.

defined in §
155.010 of this code that are located within or adjacent to the proposed
development shall be upgraded, by the developer at his or her expense, to city
standards. Off-site roads that are proposed by the developer to be improved to
less than city standards shall be by written request of the developer and must
be acted on as a variance to this chapter.
      (5)   Construction requirements.
         (a)   Residential and collector street construction. The developer
shall, at his or her own cost and expense, construct all residential and
collector streets within the subdivision in accordance with city standards (see
Ch. 155 Appendix). No proposed pavement section of lesser thickness or using
alternate materials to those shown on the
Ch. 155 Appendix attachments shall be permitted unless the design is fully
documented by the developer’s engineer to substantiate that the alternate
design will provide equivalent capacity and durability and the alternate design
is approved by the City Council with the advice and consent of the City
Engineer.
         (b)   Major thoroughfare construction.
            1.   On roadways, adjacent to the proposed subdivision, that are
designated to be major thoroughfares, the subdivider shall be required to
construct, at his or her own cost and expense, ½ of the proposed ultimate
street section together with proper drainage facilities.
            2.   Where major thoroughfares traverse a subdivision, the
subdivider shall be required, at his or her own cost and expense, to construct
a 2-lane wide section on each side of the roadway. Construction shall be in
accordance with city standard construction details (see
Appendix Attachments 5 and 6).
            3.   No proposed pavement section of lesser thickness or using
alternate materials to those shown on the

as follows (unless approved by the City Engineer).
 
Type of Street     Maximum Grade
Collector          8%
Major thoroughfare 6%
Residential        10%
 
      (8)   Median openings. Median openings, median pavers, and left turn
lanes, including channelizing buttons, constructed to serve dedicated streets
or private drives, shall be installed and paved to city standards (see
Appendix) by the developer. Existing trees in the median, if affected by median
improvements, must be relocated or replaced. If the trees cannot be relocated
or replaced in the median, then the developer shall pay a reasonable fee to the
city to replace the tree or equivalent caliber of trees in public right-of-way
or on public land.
      (9)   Acceleration and deceleration lanes. Acceleration or deceleration
lanes shall be installed by the developers when required by the City Engineer,
and constructed to the same standards as the adjoining street in accordance
with the City Engineer’s requirements.
      (10)   Future connections. Street extensions may be required to link
subdivisions as the neighborhood develops. Temporary cul-de-sacs shall be
installed by the developer when required by phasing.
      (11)   Intersections. Street intersections shall be constructed in
accordance with the city’s standards, as modified by the City Engineer for
application within the city’s jurisdiction.
      (12)   Traffic buttons. If recommended by the City Engineer and required
by the Commission, the developer shall install traffic buttons which are
necessary for the safe transition, channelization, or separation of traffic.
      (13)   Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be
permitted in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to any
street, unless a variance, in writing, is requested.
      (14)   Grading and improvement plan. Streets shall be graded and improved
in conformance with the city standards (see
Appendix), and the design and specifications shall be approved as to design and
specifications by the City Engineer. The construction plans are required to be
submitted prior to plat approval, and shall include cross sections at a minimum
of every 100 feet.
      (15)   Topography and arrangement.
         (a)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography.
Residential streets shall be curvilinear as defined below. All streets shall be
arranged so as to obtain building sites, when possible, at or above the grades
of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
Design speeds shall be included in the plan set for roadway horizontal and
vertical design.
         (b)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
            CURVILINEAR STREETS. Generally, streets which have at least 75% of
the center line length along curves having radii of no more than 500 feet and
subtending arcs of at least 45 degrees. This definition is subject to site
physical consideration and site configuration.
         (c)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of streets and dedicated rights-of-way as established on the
city’s thoroughfare plan. However, collector streets not shown on the plan may
be required to meet traffic requirements of proposed development. Residential
streets shall be designed to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
         (d)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be platted, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Commission that extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or
addition with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development
of adjacent tracts.
      (16)   Continuation of streets and cul-de-sacs.
         (a)   The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
principal streets between adjacent properties.
         (b)   If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
temporarily be a dead-end street, the street shall be constructed to the
property line in accordance with city standards (see
Appendix).
         (c)   Cul-de-sac turnarounds having a minimum radius of 40 feet shall
be provided at the end of all permanent dead-end streets.
      (17)   Cul-de-sac length. No cul-de-sac unless otherwise authorized shall
exceed 600 feet in length, which is to be measured from the center line of the
street with which it intersects to the center point of the cul-de-sac. Lengths
longer than 600 feet shall require specific approval by the Council. In
reviewing an over-length submittal, the Commission shall consider the
following:
         (a)   Alternative designs which would reduce cul-de-sac length;
         (b)   Means of mitigation, including but not limited to increased
street width, mid-block turnarounds, limitation on the number of lots to be
created and served, temporary points of access, and additional fire protection
measures.
      (18)   Street names and signs.
         (a)   Street names must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for approval in accordance with the city’s guidelines for the naming
of streets. Names of corporations may not be used as street names. The Planning
and Zoning Commission will maintain an index of street names which will contain
these guidelines. Street names and subdivision names are fixed at the time of
approval of the final plat. A fee, in accordance with this code, will be
charged to change street names and subdivision names after approval of the
final plat, and approved by the appropriate post office.
         (b)   The developer shall purchase and install all street signs to
city approved standards.
         (c)   Street name signs shall be installed in accordance with the
city’s guidelines before issuance of a building permit for any structure on the
streets approved.
      (19)   Street lights.
         (a)   Street lighting shall conform to ordinances and standards of the
city. The cost of street lighting, including installation, maintenance and
operation shall be borne by the developer and the Home Owners Association.
         (b)   Street lights shall use full cut-off fixtures to confine light
to the area requiring illumination. The developer shall submit a street
lighting plan that includes conduit with construction plans for approval by the
city. The developer shall install conduit for street lights and traffic signals
in divided thoroughfares as directed by the City Engineer, conduit shall be
scheduled 80 with a minimum diameter of 3 inches with hand holes at all change
of direction and at termination points.
   (D)   Street dedications and reservations.
      (1)   Dedication of right-of-way. The developer shall provide all right-
of-way required for existing or future streets, including perimeter streets, as
shown in the thoroughfare plan or other valid development plans approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council. Additional right-of-way may be
necessary to meet drainage, utility placement, visibility, emergency egress and
ingress, or other requirements as required by the City Engineer. In the case of
perimeter streets, at least ½ of the total required right-of-way for those
streets shall be provided. However, in some instances more than ½ shall be
required depending on the actual or proposed alignment of the street. Standard
right-of-way widths are specifically set forth in accordance with city
standards (see
Appendix).
      (2)   Perimeter streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a
new subdivision or addition, the remaining ½ of the street shall be dedicated
and improved by the developer of the addition.
      (3)   Slope easements. The dedication of easements, in addition to
dedicated rights- of-way, shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. These slopes
shall not be in excess of 4 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical, unless accepted
by City Engineer.
   (E)   Street construction. The developer shall construct all streets or
thoroughfares in accordance with city standards (see
Appendix) in rights-of-way as required by the thoroughfare plan, subject to
participation policies stated in §
155.091 of this code. Streets which dead-end at power lines or similar rights-
of-way and are intended for future extension shall be constructed in the full
right-of- way as required by the thoroughfare plan, for ½ the distance across
the right-of-way for each side.
   (F)   Improvement, widening, and realignment of existing and proposed
streets. Where a subdivision or addition borders a substandard street or when
the thoroughfare plan indicates plans for realignment, widening, or
constructing a street that would require use of some of the land in the
subdivision or addition, the applicant shall improve and dedicate those areas
for widening or realignment of those streets, as follows.
      (1)   When a proposed subdivision or addition abuts or will abut both
sides of a substandard street or a proposed street in the major thoroughfare
plan, the developer shall improve the substandard street or proposed street so
that it will be a standard street. The minimum street cross- sections are as
shown in the
Appendix, Attachments 1 through 6.
      (2)   If the proposed subdivision or addition is located along only 1
side of a substandard street or a proposed street in the major thoroughfare
plan, the owner shall be required to improve his or her
side of the substandard street or proposed street, so that it will be a
standard street. The minimum street paving width shall be as shown in division
(C)(6) of this section. The developer may, however, petition the city to
construct the improvements herein required, subject, upon approval, to the
city’s escrow policies stated in §
155.091 of this code.
      (3)   When any nonresidential street is to be extended through a property
to intersect with another nonresidential street, the full design width shall be
constructed for a minimum distance of 350 feet from the point of intersection.
From that point the pavement width may be decreased, with provision of an
appropriate transition in paving width. If property abutting only 1 side of the
proposed thoroughfare is to be developed, then ½ of the lanes shall be
constructed, including left turn lane and transition.
   (G)   Access from residential subdivisions or additions. Residential lots
shall have a minimum street frontage at least 4 times the minimum side yard
setback (cul-de-sac lots not included). Where subdivisions are platted so that
lots face onto thoroughfares, direct driveway access to the thoroughfare is not
permitted unless the lot has a front yard setback of at least 75 feet and a lot
width of at least 150 feet.
   (H)   Private streets. Subdivisions may be developed with private streets
instead of public streets if the development complies with the requirements of
this section and the subdivision has received a specific use permit for a
private street development.
      (1)   Design and construction standards. Private streets shall conform to
the same standards regulating the design and construction of public streets.
      (2)   Streets excluded. Streets shown on the thoroughfare plan shall not
be used, maintained, or constructed as private streets. Also, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may deny the creation of any other private street if in the
Commission’s judgment the private street would negatively affect traffic
circulation on public streets or impair access to property either on-site or
off-site to the subdivision, impair access to or from public facilities
including schools, parks, and libraries, or delay the response time of
emergency vehicles.
      (3)   Homeowners associations required. Subdivisions developed with
private streets shall have a homeowners association which includes all property
served by private streets. The association shall own and be responsible for the
maintenance of private streets and appurtenances. The association documents
must establish a reserve fund for the maintenance of streets and other
improvements. The association documents shall be reviewed and approved by the
City Attorney to ensure that they conform to this and other applicable city
ordinances. The documents shall be filed of record prior to the approval of the
final plat. Lot deeds must convey membership in the association and provide for
the payment of dues and assessments required by the association. The
association may not be dissolved without the prior written consent of the city.
No portion of the association documents pertaining to the maintenance of the
private streets and assessments may be amended without the written consent of
the city.
      (4)   Private street lot.
         (a)   Private streets shall be constructed within a separate lot owned
by the homeowners association. The street shall be in accordance with city
standards (see
Appendix Attachments 1 through 6), and the lot shall conform to all applicable
city requirements.
         (b)   An easement covering the street lot shall be granted to the city
providing unrestricted use of the property for utilities and the maintenance of
same. This right shall extend to all utility providers, including telecable
companies, operating within the city. The easement shall also provide the city
with the right of access for any purpose related to the exercise of a
governmental service or function, including but not limited to fire and police
protection, inspection, and code enforcement. The easement shall permit the
city to remove any vehicle or obstacle within the street lot that impairs
emergency access.
      (5)   Construction and maintenance cost. The city shall not pay for any
portion of the cost of constructing or maintaining a private street.
      (6)   City utilities. Water, sewer (when required), drainage facilities,
street lights, and signs placed within the private street lot shall be
installed to city standards and dedicated to the city prior to approval of the
final plat. All city regulations relating to infrastructure financing,
developer cost participation, and capital cost recovery shall apply to
developments with private streets, with the exception of those applying to
street construction.
      (7)   Plans and inspections. Developments proposed with private streets
must submit to the city the same plans and engineering information required to
construct public streets and utilities. Requirements pertaining to inspection
and approval of improvements prior to final plat approval shall apply. Fees
charged for these services shall also apply. The city may periodically inspect
private streets and require repairs necessary to ensure emergency access.
      (8)   Access restrictions. The entrances to all private streets must be
marked with a sign stating that it is a private street. Guard houses, access
control gates, and cross arms may be constructed with approval of the City
Council. All restricted access entrances must be staffed 24 hours every day, or
provide an alternative means of ensuring access to the subdivision by the city
and other utility service providers with appropriate identification. If the
association fails to maintain reliable access as required to provide city
services, the city may enter the subdivision and remove any gate or device
which is a barrier to access at the sole expense of the association. The
association documents shall contain provisions in conformity with this division
which may not be amended without the written consent of the city.
      (9)   Waiver of services. The subdivision final plat, property deeds, and
property owner association documents shall note that certain city services
shall not be provided on private streets. Among the services which will not be
provided are: routine police patrols, enforcement of traffic and
parking ordinances, and preparation of accident reports. All private traffic
regulatory signs shall conform to the State Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices. Depending on the characteristics of the proposed development, other
services may not be provided.
      (10)   Petition to convert to public streets. The property association
documents shall allow the association to request the city accept private
streets and the associated property as public streets and rights-of-way upon
written notice to all association members and the favorable vote of 51% of the
membership. However, in no event shall the city be obligated to accept these
streets as public. Should the city elect to accept the streets as public, the
city may inspect the private streets and assess the lot owners for the expense
of needed repairs concurrent with the city’s acceptance of the streets. The
city will be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed. The city may also
require, at the association’s expense, the removal of guard houses, access
control devices, landscaping, or other aesthetic amenities located within the
street lot. The association documents shall provide for the city’s right to
this assessment. Those portions of the association documents pertaining to the
subject matter contained in this division shall not be amended without the
written consent of the city.
      (11)   Hold harmless. The subdivision final plat shall specifically state
that the homeowners association, as owner of the private streets and
appurtenances, agrees to release, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
city, any governmental entity, and public utility for damages to the private
street occasioned by the reasonable use of the private street by the city,
governmental entity, or public utility; for damages and injury (including
death) arising from the condition of that private street; for damages and
injury (including death) arising out of the use by the city, governmental
entity, or public utility of any restricted access gate or entrance; and for
damages and injury (including death) arising out of any use of the subdivision
by the city, government entity, or public utility. Further, the statement shall
provide that all lot owners shall release the city, governmental entities, and
public utilities for such damages and injuries. The indemnifications contained
in this division apply regardless of whether or not those damages and injury
(including death) are caused by the negligent act or omission of the city,
governmental entity, or public utility, or their representative officers,
employees, or agents.

with city approved safety (sloped) head walls, and side slopes of drainage
ditches shall not be steeper than 4:1, unless approved by the City Engineer.
         (d)   For control of erosion along drainage ditches and channels in
subdivisions, the developer shall provide a complete climate adaptable grass
cover or other city accepted erosion material along the ditches and channels
prior to acceptance of the work by the city. Grass shall be placed by using
solid sod to obtain the required coverage. Alternatively, if adequate
precautions are taken for erosion control, hydromulch may be used. During the
first growing season, the grassed area shall be fertilized. Water sufficient to
obtain complete coverage of the area shall be provided daily for at least 60
days prior to final acceptance by the city. Areas which do not exhibit healthy
growth within 90 days shall be
replanted until a healthy growth is obtained. On all open ditch drainage
facilities, the developer shall be responsible for keeping silt removed, eroded
areas restored, and ground cover in place for 2 years after acceptance of the
development or until 90% of the lots have been developed, whichever occurs
first. Each lot shall include erosion control devices to minimize silting of
open channels. The developer’s assurance of this maintenance shall be in a form
acceptable to the city.
      (4)   Discharge of storm drainage shall be at a point of adequate
capacity. If adequate capacity does not exist off-site, the developer shall be
required to provide off-site drainage improvements or improve downstream
facilities so they are adequate to carry the 100-year storm flow under fully
developed conditions.
   (B)   Design of facilities.
      (1)   Standards. The design, materials, and construction of storm
drainage structures shall be in accordance with the City of Plano Storm
Drainage Design Manual as may be amended by this chapter and the City Engineer.
Plans and calculations shall be submitted with the plat. Detention systems
shall be designed for a series of storm frequencies 2, 25, 50, and 100 year
storm events. Each pond shall have a designed outlet structure to release storm
water for the various storm frequencies.
      (2)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
run-off from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision or addition. The developer’s engineer shall initially determine the
necessary size of the facility based on the provisions of the construction
standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development, subject to approval by the City Engineer.
      (3)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The developer’s engineer,
shall study the effect of each addition’s storm run-off on the existing land
and drainage facilities immediately downstream of the addition. Where it is
determined that existing capacity is not available immediately downstream as
assessed by the City Engineer, the developer’s engineer shall design a drainage
system, detention facility, or parallel system to mitigate the deficiency. The
Commission may withhold (if a waiver is on file) or deny approval of the plat
until this mitigation has been provided.
      (4)   Location. Except where otherwise required, drainage shall be
provided in a system of earthen channels where depth does not exceed 4 feet,
including 1 foot of freeboard or a combination of open channels and underground
storm drainage system constructed in street rights-of- way, or in easements.
      (5)   Construction of underground facilities. In some cases, a developer
may choose or be required to install drainage facilities underground. All flows
which cannot be conveyed by 4 feet of deep earthen channels will be in
underground system or in combination of open channel and underground pipe
system. These installations are subject to approval by the City Engineer.
      (6)   Detention facilities. Lakes, detention ponds, and retention ponds
may be constructed in all areas, provided they are approved by the City
Engineer. Easements shall be provided to ensure protection of these areas for
maintenance purposes. Detention facilities shall include a maintenance plan as
part of the design.
      (7)   Alternate facilities. Other innovative drainage concepts will be
considered if approved by the City Engineer.
   (C)   Creeks and floodplains.
      (1)   Floodplain restrictions. The City Council shall, when it deems it
necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage,
and sanitary facilities, prohibit development of any portion of the property
which lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. These
floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage
resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste, or material, or
stumps, except at the discretion of the City Council. Floodplains are also
subject to the restrictions of the tree preservation requirements in this code,
if any.
      (2)   Creek restrictions. Major creeks shall remain in open natural
condition; smaller creeks or drainage ways may be channelized, provided they
meet the criteria of the storm drainage requirements of the city, the Corps of
Engineers and as accepted by the City Engineer. All creeks and excavated
channels shall remain part of the platted lot with a city dedicated drainage
easement. The easement may be dedicated to the city or a homeowners
association. When a creek or excavated channel is to remain open, or in its
natural condition, it shall meet 1 of the following requirements, subject to
approval of Council:
         (a)   Creeks and drainage ways may be retained as a part of a
residential lot, and it shall be the property owner’s responsibility to
maintain this area, except as otherwise provided. A maintenance drainage
easement shall be granted to the city at city request and shall grant the right
but not the obligation to maintain and construct drainage facilities if the
creek or drainage way is not being properly maintained. A lien may be filed
against the property in favor of the city to secure payment of any expenses
incurred by the city for maintenance;
         (b)   Creeks or drainage ways may be owned and maintained by an
approved maintenance entity. A maintenance entity may include homeowners
association or similar entity. The maintenance entity’s bylaws and covenants
filed of record, if any, shall provide for ongoing maintenance. The easement
shall authorize a lien against individual abutting lots in favor of the city to
secure the payment to the city for any expenses incurred by the city in the
event of default; or
         (c)   All properties may create an entity to maintain creeks or
drainage ways, provided the maintenance area is set forth by easement and the
entity’s bylaws, filed of record, provide for ongoing maintenance. These
easements shall authorize a lien against individual abutting properties in
favor of the city to secure payment for any expenses incurred if the
maintenance entity is not properly maintaining the creek or drainage way.
Adequate floodway easements and drainage easements shall be required that give
the city the right but not the obligation to maintain and construct drainage
facilities if, in the city’s sole opinion, the maintenance entity is not
properly maintaining the creek or drainage way.
      (3)   Right of approval. In all cases, the city shall have the discretion
to approve, or disapprove, the proposed street alignment fronting on city
trails, or drainage ways and creeks.
   (D)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. On request of the city, when a subdivision or
addition is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, there
shall be provided a storm water or drainage easement conforming substantially
to the line of that watercourse, and of a width and construction as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow and access for maintenance.
      (2)   Maintenance and access easements. The property owner shall provide
sufficient access on each side of and parallel to creeks or drainage ways for
maintenance purposes. The access shall be above the base flood elevation and
accessible to vehicles and equipment. Access must also be provided at a maximum
1,200-foot spacing along streets. The location and size of the maintenance and
access easement shall be determined by the City Engineer. The minimum width
shall be 10 feet, and the maximum width of the access easement shall be 15
feet. Permanent monuments, the type and locations of which to be approved by
the City Engineer, shall be placed along the boundaries of the maintenance and
access easement and private property. This maintenance and access easement
shall be included in the dedication requirements of this section, and included
in the drainage and floodway easement width.
      (3)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 25 feet in width, depending on
slopes, for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the
street lines and with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be
shown on the plat. Drainage easements shall extend from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
         (b)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision or addition, appropriate drainage easements must
be secured.

   (C)   Additional requirements for certain replats.
      (1)   In addition to compliance with division (B) above, a replat without
vacation of the preceding plat must conform to the requirements of this section
if:
         (a)   During the preceding 5 years, any of the area to be replatted
was limited by an interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use
for not more than 2 residential units per lot; or
         (b)   Any lot in the preceding plat was limited by deed restrictions
to residential use for not more than 2 residential units per lot.
      (2)   Compliance with this division (C) is not required for approval of a
replat of part of a preceding plat if the area to be replatted was designated
or reserved for other than single or duplex family residential use by notation
on the last legally recorded plat or in the legally recorded restrictions
applicable to the plat.
      (3)   Notice of the hearing required under division (B) shall be given
before the fifteenth day before the date of the hearing by publication in an
official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation in the county and by
written notice, with a copy of division (C) attached, forwarded by the
Commission to the owners, as indicated on the most recently approved ad valorem
tax roll of the city, of property in the original subdivision within 200 feet
of the property upon which the replat is requested. The written notice may be
delivered by depositing the notice, properly addressed with postage prepaid, in
a post office or postal depository within the boundaries of the city.
      (4)   If the proposed replat requires a variance, and the owners of 20%
or more of the area of lots to whom notice is required to be given under
division (B) file with the Commission a written protest of the replatting
before or at the hearing, approval of the replat will require the affirmative
vote of 3/4 of the Commission members present. In computing percentages of
ownership, each lot is considered equal to all other lots regardless of size or
number of owners, and the owners of each lot are entitled to cast only 1 vote
per lot. The area of streets and alleys shall be included in computing the
percentage of land area.
      (5)   Any replat which adds or deletes lots must include the original lot
boundaries.

155.999
§ 155.077 VACATION OF PLAT.
   (A)   By property owner. The property owner of the tract covered by a plat
may vacate, upon the approval of the Council, the plat at any time before any
lot in the plat is sold. The plat is vacated when a signed, acknowledged
instrument declaring the plat vacated is approved and recorded in the manner
prescribed for the original plat.
   (B)   By all lot owners. If lots in the plat have been sold, the plat may be
vacated on the application of all the owners of lots in the plat with approval
obtained in the manner prescribed for the original plat.
   (C)   Criteria. The Council shall approve the petition for vacation on terms
and conditions as are reasonable to protect public health, safety, and welfare.
As a condition of vacation of the plat, the Council may direct the petitioners
to prepare a revised final plat in accordance with this chapter.
   (D)   Effect of action. On the execution and recording of the vacating
instrument, the vacated plat shall have no effect. Regardless of the Council’s
action on the petition, the property owner or developer will have no right to a
refund of any monies, fees, or charges paid to the city nor to the return of
any property or consideration dedicated or delivered to the city except as may
have previously been agreed to by the Council.
   (E)   Government initiated plat vacation.
      (1)   General conditions. The Council, on its motion, may vacate the plat
of an approved subdivision or addition when:
         (a)   No lots within the approved plat have been sold within 5 years
from the date that the plat was signed by the Mayor;
         (b)   The property owner has breached an agreement and the city is
unable to obtain funds with which to complete construction of public
improvements, except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by the
property owner or its successor; and
         (c)   The plat has been of record for more than 5 years and the
Council determines that the further sale of lots within the subdivision or
addition presents a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, except that
the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by the property owner or its
successors.
      (2)   Procedure. Upon any motion of the Council to vacate the plat of any
previously approved subdivision or addition, in whole or in part, the Council
shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county and
provide personal notice to all homeowners within the subdivision or addition
and shall also provide notice to the Commission. The notice shall state the
time and place for a public hearing on the motion to vacate the subdivision or
addition plat. The Council shall approve the vacation only if the criteria in
division (D) above are satisfied.
      (3)   Record of notice. If the Council adopts a resolution vacating a
plat in whole, it shall record a copy of the resolution in the County Clerk’s
office. If the Council adopts a resolution vacating a plat in part, it shall
cause a revised final plat to be recorded which shows that portion of the
original plat that has been vacated and that portion that has not been vacated.

DEVELOPMENT PLATS
§ 155.080 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter shall apply to any land lying within the city and/or within
its extraterritorial jurisdiction in the following circumstances:
   (A)    The development of any tract of land which has not been platted or
replatted prior to the effective date of this subchapter, unless expressly
exempted herein;
   (B)   The development of any tract of land for which the property owner
claims an exemption from the city’s Subdivision Regulations, including
requirements to replat, which exemption is not expressly provided for in such
regulations;
   (C)   The development of any tract of land for which the only access is a
private easement or street; or
   (D)   The division of any tract of land resulting in parcels or lots, each
of which is greater than 5 acres in size, and where no public improvement is
proposed to be dedicated or constructed.
(Ord. 737, passed 7-20-2016)
§ 155.081 EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   No development plat shall be required where the land to be developed
has received final plat or replat approval prior to the effective date of this
subchapter. The City Council may, from time-to-time, exempt other development
or land divisions from the requirements of this subchapter by majority vote of
the City Council. Existing owner occupied farming operations on land which is
held under the agriculture-related exemption are exempt from providing a
development plat on the construction of improvements or structures to be used
solely for the storage of agriculture-related products such as wire fences,
farm equipment, livestock, feed, and other agriculture commodities.
   (B)   Development on a single lot which meets all the requirements of Single
Family zoning (“SF”) classification shall be exempt from the requirements of
this subchapter for the preparation and filing of a development plat. Plans and
any required statements as to use, parking, access, and other relevant issues,
with the required fee(s), if any, shall be presented by the landowner to the
city. The city staff may approve the plans and/or require such amendments and
modifications as necessary. Written affidavits from the landowner may be
required regarding use of the structure(s) and their compliance with SF
regulations. The staff shall grant a waiver to the preparation and filing of a
development plat if all requirements of SF are being met. This process does not
zone the property SF. It determines whether or not a development plat is
required, or waived.
   (C)   Appeal. Any person owning property subject to this subchapter who
wishes to appeal the decision of the staff may, on written notice filed with
the City Secretary within 10 days of the decision being appealed, appeal the
decision to the City Council. The City Council may review the staff’s decision
and may affirm, reverse, or modify the staff’s decision. The City Council may
call a public hearing on the matter at their discretion.
(Ord. 737, passed 7-20-2016)
§ 155.082 PROHIBITION ON DEVELOPMENT.
   No development shall commence, nor shall any building permit, utility
connection permit, electrical connection permit or similar permit be issued,
for any development or land division subject to this subchapter, or the city’s
Subdivision Regulations, until a subdivision plat or development plat (as
required) has been reviewed by the Planning Commission, approved by the City
Council, and submitted to the city for filing at the county. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this section, the city shall not require building permits or
otherwise enforce the city’s building code in the city’s ETJ in relation to any
development plat required by this subchapter.
(Ord. 737, passed 7-20-2016) Penalty, see §
155.999

specifications as required by the city's Subdivision Regulations, and to any
other applicable regulations of the city that are related to development of a
land parcel;
   (F)   Development plats in areas which have not been zoned, including the
exterritorial jurisdiction, shall have set back and side yard requirements for
each lot as shown on the Comprehensive Plan for regulations for the location of
the tract for which a development plat is required; and
   (G)   The development plat shall have a full engineering analysis of
drainage on the property, including designations of the 100-year flood plain,
floodways, and other related on- or off-site drainage affecting the property
itself, and property downstream as a result of the development of the property.
The development plat shall clearly show the location and specifications of any
onsite sewage systems. The amount of the plat area covered in impervious
construction, such as roofs, all other parking lots, or other surfaces which
may increase run-off shall be shown, in a drainage plan provided as part of the
development plat documentation for the review and approval of the City
Engineer, and the city.
(Ord. 737, passed 7-20-2016)
§ 155.084 CONDITIONS ON APPROVAL.
   (A)   The City Council may impose such conditions on the approval of the
development plat as are necessary to assure compliance with the standards in §
155.083(E).
   (B)   Restriction on issuance of building and other permits by municipality,
county or official of other governmental entity. The municipality, a county, or

subchapter until a development plat is filed with and approved by the
municipality in accordance with this subchapter.
   (C)   Approval of development plat. The city shall endorse approval on a
development plat filed with it if the plat conforms to:
      (1)   The general plans, rules, and ordinances of the municipality
concerning its current and future streets, sidewalks, alleys, parks,

      (2)   The general plans, rules, and ordinances for the extension of the
municipality or the extension, improvement, or widening of its roads, streets,
and public highways within the municipality and in its extraterritorial
jurisdiction, taking into account access to and extension of water mains and
the instrumentalities of public utilities (including sewer lines, where
expressly authorized in the city); and
      (3)   Any general plans, rules, or ordinances adopted under Tex. Local
Gov't Code § 212.044, and §
155.083 of this code.
   (D)   Effect of approval on dedication. The approval of a development plat
is not considered an acceptance of any proposed dedication for public use or
use by persons other than the owner of the property covered by the plat and
does not impose on the municipality any duty regarding the maintenance or
improvement of any purportedly dedicated parts until the municipality's
governing body makes an actual appropriation of the dedicated parts by formal
acceptance, entry, use, or improvement.
(Ord. 737, passed 7-20-2016)
§ 155.085 PROCEDURE.

submitted to the city in the same manner as a final plat (see city’s

expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the City Administrator (or
designee) and if the plat is not filed at the county within the time periods
specified for a final plat.

shown thereon are not substantially complete within 1 year of City Council
approval of the development plat. The 1- year period may be extended as part of

(Ord. 737, passed 7-20-2016)
§ 155.086 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.

      (4)   Show all easements and rights-of-way within or abutting the
boundary of the surveyed property;
      (5)   The dimensions of each street, sidewalk, alley, square, park, or

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 155.090 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General. Where the Council finds that unreasonable hardships or
difficulties may result from strict compliance with this chapter, or the
purposes of this chapter may be served to a greater extent by an alternative
proposal, it may approve variances to this chapter so that substantial justice
may be done and the public interest secured; provided, that the variance shall
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter; and
further provided, the Council shall not approve variances unless it shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of this chapter is carried out; and
      (4)   The variance will not in any manner materially vary the provisions
of Chapter 156 of this code or the Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Criteria for variances from development requirements. Where the
Council finds that the imposition of any development exaction pursuant to this
chapter exceeds reasonable benefit to the property owner or is so excessive as
to constitute confiscation of the tract to be platted, it may approve variances
to those requirements, so as to prevent that excess.
   (C)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Council may require conditions
as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the purposes described in §
155.003.
   (D)   Procedures. A petition for a variance shall be submitted in writing by
the developer. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application
and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

equity to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages, to impose
additional penalties, and to restrain, correct, or abate a violation of this
chapter, whether the violation occurs with respect to lands within the
corporate boundaries of the city or within the city’s extraterritorial
jurisdiction. These remedies shall be in addition to the penalties described in
§
155.999.

      (2)   Any violations of the provisions of the manufactured housing
district ordinance passed September 19, 1995 which occurred prior to the date
of any amendments to this chapter are not waived or released by those
amendments. The provisions of this chapter in effect on the date of any
violation of this chapter shall be interpreted as still being in effect on the
date any violation is prosecuted. Further, no amendments to this chapter shall
waive, accept, or approve any nonconforming use which existed immediately prior
to September 19, 1995, the date the preceding manufactured housing district
ordinance was enacted. Any nonconforming use on the date this manufactured
housing district ordinance was originally passed by the city is a nonconforming
use solely for the size of the tract, the number of mobile homes, or
manufactured homes, located on the manufactured housing tracts, or the mobile
home tracts, on the date this chapter was passed. No additional manufactured
housing or mobile homes are permitted without strict compliance with this

§ 156.35 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   The purpose of Planned Development (PD) is to provide an alternative
zoning district to ensure flexible, innovative developments under controlled
conditions which preserve the natural features of individual tracts and
encourage developers to provide for open space in all areas not otherwise
attainable under conventional base zoning districts.
   (B)   Review procedure. The following procedure shall be used for PDs:
      (1)   Step one: pre-application activities.
         (a)   Pre-application conference. A pre-application conference is
required to be held. In addition, the applicant shall include a concept/
schematic plan for review by the Director to help determine whether or not a
proposed PD is the appropriate procedure for the applicant and the city. The
concept/schematic plan shall include at a minimum the following:
            1.   Proposed uses;
            2.   Number and type of units;
            3.   Floor area of all buildings;
            4.   Floor area of each use for mixed-use buildings (if
applicable);
            5.   Proposed parking capacity and configuration;
            6.   General site planning layout and phasing; and
            7.   Summary of proposed deviations from the City's Code of
Ordinance standards and a description of compensating public benefits achieved
through the PD process.
      (2)   Step two: application submittal and processing.
         (a)   Generally.
            1.   The PD application shall be submitted and accepted, and may be
revised or withdrawn.
            2.   An application for rezoning to a PD shall include a PD plan.
         (b)   PD plan.
            1.   Generally.
               a.   The PD Plan establishes the development regulations for a
planned development and specifically identifies where there are deviations from
the Code of Ordinances.
               b.   The PD Plan shall include a development plan map.
               c.   Unless specifically modified by the PD Plan, the PD shall
comply with all standards in the Code of Ordinances, as amended.
               d.   Where the applicant is proposing deviations from the zoning
provisions of the Code of Ordinances, the applicant shall specify both the
existing regulations and the wording of each corresponding substitution, as
proposed. The proposed PD district shall represent a quality development when
weighed overall against the standards in the Code or the alternative
regulations proposed by the applicant.
               e.   The PD plan shall be reviewed by the Director of Public
Works and the Planning and Zoning Commission, whose recommendations are
forwarded to the City Council for review and approval.
               f.   Approval of the PD plan is required prior to approval of a
development permit in a PD zoning district.
            2.   Public benefits to be provided. When an applicant is proposing
deviations from the zoning provisions of this code to establish a PD zoning
district, the applicant shall demonstrate how the proposed PD zoning district
will generally provide public benefits to justify the increased flexibility
offered by the city through the PD procedure.
         (c)   Concurrent comprehensive plan amendment review. A comprehensive
plan amendment application may be reviewed concurrently with a PD application.
         (d)   Concurrent subdivision review. A subdivision application
submitted under
Chapter 155 may be reviewed concurrently with a PD application. A preliminary
plat for a PD shall only be approved following approval of the rezoning to PD.
      (3)   Step three: staff review and action. The Director of Public Works
shall review the PD application and prepare a staff report and recommendation
in accordance with the approval criteria below.
      (4)   Step four: scheduling and notice of public meetings/hearings. The
PD application shall be scheduled for public hearings before the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council, and noticed in accordance with applicable
law.
      (5)   Step five: review and decision.
         (a)   Planning and Zoning Commission review and recommendation. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the PD application in accordance
with the approval criteria below, and shall forward its recommendation to the
City Council.
         (b)   City Council review and decision.
            1.   The City Council may review and approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the PD application in accordance with the approval criteria
below.
            2.   If the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends denial of the
PD application, the rezoning shall become effective only by a 3/4 vote of all
members of the City Council.
            3.   The City Council may also remand the PD application back to
the Director of Public Works or the Planning and Zoning Commission for further
consideration.
            4.   If the City Council remands the PD application back to the
Director of Public Works or Planning and Zoning Commission, additional public
hearings will be required before final adoption.
         (c)   Protest procedure.
            1.   The rules governing amendment over protest are contained in
Tex. Local Gov’t Code, Chapter 211. The Director of Public Works may prescribe
forms for protest petitions.
            2.   Property owners within 200 feet of a proposed rezoning, as
indicated on the most recently approved city tax roll, may file a written
protest against the rezoning. If written protests are received by owners of 20%
or more of the area within 200 feet of the proposed rezoning, approval shall
require three-fourths vote of the City Council for a rezoning to become
effective. In such case, a supermajority vote shall not be required by the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (6)   Step six: post-decision actions and limitations.
         (a)   Adoption of a planned development district. At the time a PD
zoning document is approved by the City Council, it becomes an integral part of
this code for that PD district established by the city on the property. All
future development within the adopted PD district shall thereafter be in
conformity with the PD zoning document for that property.
         (b)   Future development. Upon adoption of the PD district, the
applicant may proceed with the development of the property in accordance with
the PD zoning document and the PD development standards document by applying
for preliminary and final plat(s) approval in accordance with the phasing plan
in the PD district.
         (c)   Administration and enforcement.
            1.   While ownership of a project may subsequently be transferred
(in whole or in part), PD zoning will continue to be implemented and maintained
on the total acreage of the PD district. It is the responsibility of the owner
to notify all prospective purchasers of the existence of the PD district and
the PD development plan.
            2.   In the event that the applicant has failed to comply with the
conditions adopted by the City Council in conjunction with the approved PD
zoning document, the city may enforce the conditions of the PD under applicable
law.

                  ii.   A significant change to the approximate boundary of one
or more development unit(s) from that approved in the PD district, as
determined by the Director of Public Works. A change to an individual
development unit generally shall be deemed to be significant if it represents a
10% increase to the approximate gross area of the development unit as approved
in the PD district;
                  iii.   An increase of 10% or more of the approved number of
projected dwelling units or gross leasable area (GLA) for an individual
development unit;
                  iv.   Any change in land use or density that is likely to
negatively impact or burden public facilities and utilities infrastructure as
determined by the Director of Public Works;
                  v.   Any change in land use or density that is likely to
negatively impact or burden mobility adjacent to the PD district or to the
overall major street system; or
                  vi.   Any other proposed change to the development plan,
which substantively alters one or more components of the PD district.
               b.   If the Director of Public Works determines the amendment to
be major, the amendment request shall be processed under the rezoning procedure
described in division (B) of this section.
            3.   Minor amendments.

above for major amendments shall be considered minor. If the Director of Public
Works determines the amendment to be minor, the Director may administratively
act on the amendment and attach stipulations or conditions of approval thereto,
to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
               b.   At least 15 days prior to consideration of a requested
minor amendment by the Director of Public Works, notice of the proposed minor
amendment shall be mailed to each owner of property wholly or partly within 200
feet of the affected development unit(s) to which the amendment relates.
               c.   If written protest to any minor amendment is received from
any notified property owner within ten days of the notification mailing date
and such protest cannot be resolved, then the minor amendment shall be
reclassified as a major amendment. No additional application shall be required;
however, all provisions governing major amendments shall then apply.
               d.   If written protest is not received as described above, the
Director of Public Works shall render a decision on the minor amendment
request.

special use permit be approved, the Commission, on the basis of recommendations
from the Administrator, may impose requirements and conditions with respect to
locations, construction, maintenance, and operation, in addition to those
expressly stipulated in the ordinance for the particular use, as it deems
necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest.

this chapter for this type of use;
         (b)   The proposed use is in harmony with the purpose and intent of
this chapter; and
         (c)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, welfare,

conditions as may be prescribed by the City Council.
      (4)   The City Council may impose additional reasonable restrictions or
conditions to carry out the spirit and intent of this chapter and to mitigate
adverse effects of the proposed use. These requirements may include, but are
not limited to, increased open space, loading and parking requirements,
suitable landscaping, and additional improvements such as drainage, trails, and
fencing.
      (5)   Prior to any public hearing before the City Council for a special

   (F)   Application filing procedure. Application shall be made by the
property owner or certified agent thereof to the Administrator on a form

by drawings as provided herein. Granting a special use permit does not exempt
the applicant from complying with requirements of
Chapter 151 of this code or other code provisions.
   (G)   Development and time limits. Following the issuance of a special use
permit, the Building Official shall ensure that if the development is
undertaken, it is commenced in compliance with the permit within one year. If

been approved in accordance with this section.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of the site plan is to ensure compliance with
this chapter and to assist in the orderly and harmonious development of the
city, to protect and enhance the general welfare, and to help prevent the
impairment or depreciation of land values and development by the erection of
structures, additions, or alterations thereto without proper attention to site
planning and preserving the intent of this chapter.
   (C)   Application. The property owner or designated representative may
initiate site plan review by filing an application with the City Administrator,
and submitting the required review fee and five copies of the site plan and
related documents.

to indicate:
      (1)   The location of all structures on the subject property and
adjoining property;

walls or fences for screening purposes, and landscaping of parking areas;
      (3)   Design of ingress and egress to minimize interference with traffic
flow on abutting streets;
      (4)   The height of all structures;
      (5)   The proposed uses for all structures;
      (6)   The location and types of all signs including lighting and heights;
and
      (7)   The facade elevations of each building, including descriptions of
materials and colors for finishes.
   (E)   Standards. The construction plan shall conform to the concept plan,
all zoning regulations, all additional requirements for the ordinance creating
the district, and any supplemental or special regulations applicable to the
particular use.
   (F)   Decision on site plan and appeal. The City Council, the Building
Official, or other official as may be designated by the City Council, shall
review and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the site plan. Appeals
from denial of site plan shall be to the Board of Adjustment, made within 15
days. Procedures will be in accordance with §
156.67.

her a complaint in writing alleging that any of the provisions of this chapter
are being violated, he or she shall immediately investigate and when necessary

§ 156.67 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   Establishment. There is hereby created a Board of Adjustment which
shall be organized, appointed, and function as follows.
   (B)   Organization.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall consist of five members who are
residents of the city, each to be appointed by resolution of the City Council
for a two-year term and removable for cause by the appointing authority upon
written charges and after public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired term of any member whose place becomes vacant for any cause, in the
same manner as the original appointment was made. The City Council may provide
for the appointment of two alternate members of the Board who shall serve in
the absence of one or more of the regular members when requested to do so by
the Mayor or City Secretary, as the case may be. All cases to be heard by the
Board of Adjustment will always be heard by a minimum number of four members.
The alternate members, when appointed, shall serve for a two-year term, and any
vacancy shall be filled in the same manner, and they shall be subject to
removal the same as the regular members.
      (2)   The person acting as Ordinance Administrator for the city shall be
an ex-officio member of the Board of Adjustment without power of vote, and as
an ex-officio member of the Board shall set up and maintain a separate file for
each application for appeal and variance received and shall record therein the
names and addresses of all persons, firms, and corporations to whom notices are
mailed, including the date of mailings and the person by whom the notices were
delivered to the mailing clerk, post office, or mail box, and further keep a
record of all notices published as required herein. All records and files
herein provided for shall be permanent and official files and records of the
city.
      (3)   The Board shall forthwith notify in writing the City Council, the
Commission, and the City Building Inspector of each decision, interpretation,
and variance granted under the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The terms of the Zoning Board of Adjustment members and alternates
shall commence December 1 of the two-year term, and shall expire on November
30.
   (C)   Operational procedure.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules to govern its
proceedings; provided, however, that the rules are not inconsistent with this
chapter or state law. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
chairperson and at other times as the Board may determine. The chairperson, or
in his or her absence, the acting chairperson, may administer oath and compel
the attendance of witnesses.
      (2)   All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The Board
shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each
question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating that fact, and shall
keep record of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall
be immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record.
      (3)   Appeals to the Board may be made in writing by any person aggrieved
or by any municipal officer, department, or board affected by any decision of
the designated Administrator. The appeal shall be filed with the Board by the
Administrator within 15 days after the original decision rendered by the
Administrator. The appeal shall be accompanied by all papers constituting the
record pertaining to that appeal. Formal notice of the appeal shall be issued
by the Administrator, this notice to specify the grounds upon which the appeal
is made.
      (4)   Appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Administrator from whom the appeal is taken certified
to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him or her,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In these cases, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the Board or a court of record on application, on notice to the
Administrator from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.
      (5)   Upon notice of appeal being given to the Administrator and before
the appeal shall be construed as having been perfected, the applicant must file
with the notice of appeal to the Board an amount of money estimated by
Administrator to be sufficient to mail and publish all notices required herein,
that amount in no case to be less than $25.
      (6)   No appeal to the Board for the same or related variance on the same
piece of property shall be allowed prior to the expiration of six months from
the previous ruling by the Board on any appeal to that body unless other
property in the immediate vicinity has, within that six-month period, been
changed or acted on by the Board or City Council so as to alter the facts and
conditions on which the previous Board action was based. Such a change of
circumstances shall permit the rehearing of an appeal by the Board prior to the
expiration of the six-month period, but those conditions shall in no wise have
any force in law to compel the Board, after a hearing, to grant a subsequent
appeal. The subsequent appeal shall be considered entirely on its merits and
the peculiar and specific conditions related to the property on which the
appeal is brought.
      (7)   At a public hearing relative to any appeal, any interested party
may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The burden of proof shall be
on the applicant to establish the necessary facts to warrant favorable action
of the Board on any appeal. Any variance granted or authorized by the Board
under the provisions of this chapter shall authorize the issuance of a building
permit or a certificate of occupancy, as the case may be, for a period of 180
days from the date of the favorable action of the Board, unless the Board shall
have in its action approved a longer period of time and has so shown that
specific longer period of time in the minutes of its action. If the building
permit or certificate of occupancy shall not have been applied for within the
180-day period or extended period as the Board may have specifically granted,
then the variance shall be deemed to have been waived and all rights thereunder
terminated. This termination and waiver shall be without prejudice to a
subsequent appeal, and the subsequent appeal shall be subject to the same
regulations and requirements for hearing as herein specified for the original
appeal.
   (D)   Actions of the Board.
      (1)   In exercising its powers, the Board of Adjustment may, on
conformity with the provisions of the statutes of this state as existing or
hereafter amended, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and make such an
order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and shall
have all the powers of the Administrator from whom the appeal is taken. The
Board shall have the power to impose reasonable conditions to be complied with
by the applicant.
      (2)   The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary
to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such
administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variance
in this chapter.
   (E)   Notice of hearing before the Board required. The Board of Adjustment
shall hold a public hearing on all appeals made to it, and written notice of
the public hearing shall be sent to the applicant and all other persons who are
owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the property on which the
appeal is made. This notice shall be given not less than ten days nor more than
30 days before the date set for the hearing to all above-mentioned owners who
have rendered their property for city taxes as the ownership appears on the
last city tax roll. The notice may be served by depositing the same, properly
addressed and postage paid, in the U.S. post office. Notice shall be given by
publishing the same in official publication of the city at least ten days and
not more than 30 days prior to the date set for the hearing, which shall state
the time and place of the hearing.
   (F)   Authority of the Board.
      (1)   A variance is an authorization by the Board of Adjustment granting
relief and doing substantial justice in the use of the applicant’s property by
a property owner where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship.
      (2)   When, in its judgment, the public convenience and welfare will be
substantially served and the appropriate use of the neighboring property will
not be substantially or permanently injured, the Board may, in specific cases,
after public notice and public hearing, and subject to appropriate conditions
and safeguards, authorize the following variances to the regulations herein
established and take action relative to the continuance or discontinuance of a
nonconforming use.
      (3)   (a)   A variance may be granted an applicant when the Board finds:
            1.   There are special circumstances or conditions applying to the
land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or
conditions are peculiar to that land or building and do not apply generally to
lands or buildings in the same district or neighborhood, and that those
circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the
provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of
the land or building;
            2.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zone or
neighborhood in which the property is located;
            3.   The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable
use of the land or building, and the variance as granted by the Board is the
minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose; and
            4.   The literal enforcement and strict application of the
provisions of this chapter will result in an unnecessary hardship inconsistent
with the general provisions and intent of this chapter, and in granting the
variance the spirit of the chapter will be preserved and substantial justice
done.
         (b)   The Board may, after public notice and hearing and subject to
the conditions and safeguards herein contained, vary or adapt the strict
application of any of the terms of this chapter under the power and authority
herein granted.
         (c)   In granting any variance under the provisions of this chapter,
the Board may designate conditions in connection therewith which, in its
opinion, will secure substantially the purpose and intent of this chapter.
      (4)   The Board may:
         (a)   Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error on
any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter;
         (b)   Interpret the intent of the Zoning Map where uncertainty exists
because the physical features on the ground vary from those on the Zoning Map
and none of the rules set forth herein apply;
         (c)   Initiate on its motion, or cause to be presented by interested
property owners, action to bring about the discontinuance of a nonconforming
structure or use under any plan whereby full value of the structure can be
amortized within a definite period of time, taking into consideration the
general character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to
conform to the regulations of this chapter;
         (d)   Permit the change of occupancy from one nonconforming use to
another nonconforming use when the extent of the second nonconforming use is
found to be less detrimental to the environment than the first;
         (e)   Permit the enlargement of a nonconforming use only when the
enlargement will not prolong the life of the nonconforming use. A specific
period of time for the return to conformity can be required;
         (f)   Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming structure or
building on the lot or tract occupied by that building; provided the
reconstruction does not, in the judgment of the Board, prevent the return of
the property to a conforming use or increase the nonconformity of a
nonconforming structure;
         (g)   Require the vacation and demolition of a nonconforming structure
which is deemed to be obsolete, dilapidated, or substandard; and
         (h)   Permit variance of the front yard, side yard, rear yard, lot
width, lot depth, coverage, minimum setback standards, off-street parking, or
off-street loading regulations where the literal enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter would result in an unnecessary hardship, and where the variance
is necessary to permit a specific parcel of land which differs from other
parcels of land in the same district by being of such a restricted area, shape,
or slope that it cannot be developed in a manner commensurate with the
development permitted upon other parcels of land in the same district. A
modification of the standard established by this chapter shall not be granted
to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor for financial reason only,
nor shall a modification be granted to permit any person a privilege in
developing a parcel of land not permitted by this chapter to other parcels of
land in the district.
   (G)   Appeals from the Board. Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer,
department, board, or bureau of the city aggrieved by any decision of the Board
of Adjustment, may seek review by a court of record of that decision, in the
manner provided by the laws of this state.

decisions of the Board shall be to the courts as provided by law.

redistricting of property, the Commission shall give written notice to property

written protest against the change, signed by the owners of 20% or more either
of the area of the lots or land included in the proposed change, or of the lots
or land immediately adjoining the same and extending 200 feet therefrom, then
the amendments shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of at
least 3/4 of all members of the City Council.
   (D)   The same procedure for notifying property owners as provided in
division (C) above shall be followed by the City Council for hearings on
proposed amendments that affect the zoning classification, redistricting
petitions, and for special use permit applications, except that the City
Council may notify all property owners of record within the city, as shown on
the current tax roll, by letter at least ten days before the hearing.
   (E)   If a petition for redistricting is denied either by the Commission or
by the City Council, another petition for reclassification of the same property
or any portion thereof shall not be filed within a period of 1 year from the
date of final denial, except with permission of the Commission or upon
initiation by the Commission or City Council.
