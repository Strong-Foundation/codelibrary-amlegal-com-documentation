   (A)   Getting the floor. Improper references are to be avoided. Every
Council Member desiring to speak shall address the Presiding Officer, and upon
recognition by the Presiding Officer shall confine himself or herself to the
question under debate, avoiding all personalities and indecorous language. All
Council Members have the right to be recognized, to make motions, and to speak.
   (B)   Interruptions. A Council Member, once recognized, shall not be
interrupted when speaking unless it is to call to order, or as herein otherwise
provided. If a Council Member, while speaking, be called to order, he or she
shall cease speaking until the question of order is determined, and, if in
order, he or she shall be permitted to proceed.
   (C)   Amending a motion. A Council Member, upon being recognized to speak,
may request that a motion on the floor for discussion be amended. Upon such a
request, the Mayor shall ask the Council Members that made and seconded the
original motion if they are willing to accept the amendment to the original
motion. If both Members agree to accept the amendment, then the original maker
of the motion will restate the original motion to include the amendment; the
motion will be considered to be amended; and debate will continue on the
amended motion. If either Member does not accept the amendment, then debate
continues on the original motion.
   (D)   Previous question. Any Council Member, upon being recognized to speak,
may move to call the question on the motion on the floor. A motion to call the
question requires a second. If there is a motion and a second on the motion to
call the question, then debate ends and there is a vote to consider ending
debate on the original motion. A majority vote of Members present is required
to end debate on a motion. Either the maker or the sponsor will be recognized
by the Mayor to make a closing comment for correction or clarification which
will be two minutes or less if needed.
   (E)   Motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider any action taken by the
Council may be made only on the day the action was taken. It may be made either
immediately during the same session or at a recessed or adjourned session
thereof. The motion must be made by one of the prevailing side, but may be
seconded by any Council Member, and may be made at any time and have precedence
over all other motions or while a Council Member has the floor; it shall be
debatable. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any Council Member from
making or remaking the same or any other motion at a subsequent meeting of the
Council.
   (F)   Remarks of Council Member when entered in minutes. A Council Member
may request, through the Presiding Officer, the privilege of having a statement
on any subject under consideration by the Council entered in the minutes.
   (G)   Format of meeting minutes. The City Secretary shall enter in the
minutes a description of the agenda item; the names and addresses of any
citizens speaking for or against the item; and any motions or votes taken by

public meeting may do so in accordance with applicable procedures and
restrictions of this chapter. A person making a presentation to the Council
will comply with any direction of the Presiding Officer for the order of
speakers, and commencement or interruption of the person's presentation to the
Council. A person may address the Council at the beginning of a Council meeting
on any matter concerning the city's business that is not included on the agenda
for the meeting. In accordance with the Texas Open Meetings Act ("Act"),
deliberation by the Council of such unscheduled matters may not occur except
for the limited purposes provided by the Act. A person may address the Council
regarding a matter included on the agenda for the meeting either at the
beginning of the meeting when citizen comments are taken, or at the time the
particular matter is taken up by the Council.
   (C)   Manner of addressing Council; time limit. Each person addressing the
Council shall give his or her name and address in an audible tone of voice, and
unless further time is granted by the Council, shall limit his or her address
to four minutes. Applicants for permits or approvals or their representatives
may be given a longer time to present an application. Special procedures for
dividing a fixed amount of time for each side on an issue or question, to be
allocated among those on each side by the proponents of the side, may be
established when an unusually large number of speakers have indicated a desire
to address the Council on a matter. Unless the city provides equipment that
simultaneously translates a presentation and allows the Council to hear such
translation simultaneously, persons making a presentation to the Council
through a translator shall be permitted twice the amount of time to make a
presentation as is provided to those not presenting through a translator. All
remarks shall be addressed to the Council as a body and not to any Council
Member thereof. No person, other than the Council Members and the person then

(Ord. 130122-B, passed 1-22-2013)
§ 41.06 PROGRAM UPDATES.
   This Program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in
risks to customers and the soundness of the city from identity theft. At least
annually, the Program Administrator will consider the city's experiences with
identity theft situation, changes in identity theft methods, changes in
identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts
the city maintains and changes in the city's business arrangements with other
entities, consult with law enforcement authorities and other city personnel.
After considering these factors, the Program Administrator will determine
whether changes to the Program, including the listing of red flags, are
warranted. If warranted, the Program Administrator will update the Program or
present the City Council with his or her recommended changes, and the City
Council will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those
changes to the Program.
(Ord. 130122-B, passed 1-22-2013)
§ 41.07 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating
this Program lies with the Program Administrator, who may be the head of the
city or his or her appointee. The Program Administrator will be responsible for
the Program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of city staff on
the Program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red
flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining
which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular
circumstances, and considering periodic changes to the Program.
   (B)   Staff training and reports.
      (1)   Initially, all city staff shall be trained either by or under the
direction of the Program Administrator in the detection of red flags, and the
responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Thereafter, all City
Accounting Department staff shall undergo update training not less than
annually. Additionally, all new City Accounting Department employees shall
undergo training.
      (2)   All City Accounting Department staff shall submit reports annually
concerning the City's compliance with the Program, the training that has been
given and the effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft, including recommendations for changes to the Program.
While incidents of identity theft are to be reported immediately to the Program
Administrator, the annual reports shall contain a recap of the incident and
include the steps taken to assist with resolution of the incident.
   (C)   Service provider arrangements. In the event the city engages a service
provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts,
including but not limited to franchise utility providers, the city will take
the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in
accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent
and mitigate the risk of identity theft.
      (1)   Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers
have such policies and procedures in place; and
      (2)   Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers
review the city's Program and report any red flags to the Program
Administrator.
   (D)   Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness
of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of
confidentiality regarding the city's specific practices relating to identity
theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this Program,
knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the Program
Administrator and those employees who need to know them for purposes of
preventing identity theft. Because this Program is to be adopted by a public
body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these
specific practices here. Therefore, only the Program's general red flag
detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

sources of pollution promulgated by EPA and set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 403, as
amended;
   (B)   Establishing uniform regulations governing the disposal of wastewater
containing industrial waste or other prohibited waste within the corporate
limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction; and
   (C)   Establishing requirements to control pollutants that pass through or
cause interference with treatment processes in the publicly owned treatment
works (“POTW”) or which may contaminate sewage sludge, thereby resulting in a
violation of the permit issued by the City of Austin for the discharge of
industrial waste into the POTW.
(Ord. 970318A, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 51.002 PURPOSES.

POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible
with the POTW;
   (D)   To ensure that the quality of wastewater treatment plant sludge is
maintained at a level that allows its use and disposal in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations and maximize opportunities to reclaim
wastewater and sludge from the POTW;
   (E)   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by pollutants in
wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the
general public;
   (F)   To implement appropriate fees for equitable distribution of the cost
of operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and
   (G)   To enable the city to comply with the conditions of the permit or
permits granted it by the City of Austin and with the sludge use and disposal
requirements of federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject.

prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (3)   Burden of proof regarding defense. In any enforcement proceeding,
the person seeking to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall have the
burden of proof.
      (4)   Applicability of defense. The affirmative defense of upset shall be
available only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards and shall not apply in any other context.
      (5)   Control of discharge pending resolution of upset. A person whose
pretreatment system is affected by upset shall control production of all
discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. (By way of example and not of limitation, this requirement shall
apply in situations where the primary source of power of the treatment facility
is reduced, lost or fails.)
   (B)   Compliance with prohibited discharge standards. A person discharging
wastewater containing prohibited waste to the POTW shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions or specific prohibitions set forth above if it can prove
that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the person
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the person’s prior discharge when
the city was in compliance with the permit and the City of Austin was regularly
in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, both were
in compliance with applicable sludge disposal requirements.
   (C)   Bypass. A person discharging wastewater containing prohibited waste to
the POTW may cause, suffer or permit to occur a bypass meeting the conditions
set forth in this division (C) and the bypass shall not constitute a violation
of the general or specific prohibitions set forth above.

of the need for a bypass, the person shall submit notice of same to the
Director at least ten days prior to the date of the anticipated bypass, if
possible.
      (4)   Notice regarding unanticipated bypass. The person shall submit
verbal notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes
aware of the bypass. A written report of the bypass shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the requirement of a
written report on a case-by-case basis if a complete verbal report has been
received within 24 hours.
      (5)   General prohibition of bypass; exceptions. Bypass is prohibited and
the Director may take enforcement action against a person causing or allowing a
bypass unless:
         (a)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage; as used herein, the term SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE shall mean substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur
in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not mean and shall not
include economic loss caused by production delays;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The person submits the notices required under divisions (C)(3)
and (4) above.
      (6)   Director approval of anticipated bypass. The Director is authorized
to approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the

MONITORING FOR SURCHARGE AND REMOVAL CREDIT DETERMINATIONS
§ 51.135 PAYMENT OF SURCHARGE FOR EXTRA STRENGTH WASTEWATER.
   In addition to compliance with all other requirements of this chapter, any
person discharging extra strength wastewater to the POTW shall pay a monthly
surcharge for the additional costs of handling and treatment of the extra
strength wastewater in addition to the usual monthly sewer service charges.
(Ord. 970318A, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 51.136 COST FACTORS.
   The cost factors for extra strength wastewater are based on the capital and
operating cost of wastewater facilities to provide treatment for the reduction
of excessive BOD, COD and suspended solids.
(Ord. 970318A, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 51.137 COMPUTATION OF SURCHARGE.
   (A)   For extra strength wastewater having a COD concentration of 2.25 or
more times that of the BOD concentration, the surcharge will be based on the
COD category in lieu of the BOD category. Computations of surcharges shall be
based on the following formula:
S = V x 8.34 (A [BOD - 200] + B [SS - 200])
or
S = V x 8.34 (C [COD - 450] + B [SS - 200])
      S:   Surcharge in dollars that will appear on the customers monthly
bills.
      V:   Wastewater actually billed in millions of gallons during the billing
period.
      8.34:   Pounds per gallon of water.
   (B)   Unit charge in dollars per pound of BOD:
      (1)   BOD: BOD strength in milligrams per liter (mg/l) by weight; and
      (2)   200: normal BOD strength in milligrams per liter (mg/l) by weight.
   (C)   Unit charge in dollars per pound for SS:
      (1)   SS: suspended solids (SS) concentration in milligrams per liter
(mg/l) by weight; and
      (2)   200: normal SS concentration in milligrams per liter (mg/l) by
weight.
   (D)   Unit charge in dollars per pound for COD:
      (1)   COD: COD strength in milligrams per liter (mg/l) by weight; and
      (2)   450: normal COD strength in milligrams per liter (mg/l) by weight.
   (E)   If the strength or concentration for BOD, SS or COD is less than the
normal strength for that category, then there shall be no surcharge for that
category, nor shall there be credit given for the total surcharge if the
strength or concentration is less than the normal.
(Ord. 970318A, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 51.138 ADJUSTMENT OF RATES.
   All flow rates, BOD, COD and SS values used in determination of the
surcharge of wastewater customers shall be re-evaluated on a periodic basis as
determined by the Director and shall be adjusted to reflect any increase or
decrease in wastewater treatment costs. However, if there is a major change in
the operation to cause changes in value, the values may be increased or
decreased based on a study of changes or actual measurements. Every person
discharging wastewater to the POTW shall be responsible for notifying the
Director of major changes in its operation affecting the quantity or quality of
extra strength wastewater discharged. In the absence of the notification, the
surcharge applicable to the person shall be based on the data available to the
Director at the time the surcharge is billed.
(Ord. 970318A, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 51.139 REMOVAL CREDITS.
   Any person wishing to apply for removal credit, as described in 40 C.F.R.
part 403, may do so; provided, the person assumes responsibility for all costs
incurred including those costs incurred by the city. The person shall affirm
this responsibility to the Director in a writing signed and dated by an
authorized representative of the person which shall be subject to review and
approval by the City Attorney. Any removal credit granted shall be in
accordance with the procedures for same set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 403.

remedy, administrative or criminal.
   (D)   Persons responsible. A person is responsible for a violation of this
chapter if:
      (1)   The person commits or assists in the commission of a violation; or
      (2)   The person is the owner, occupant or manager of the property or
facilities determined to be the source of a discharge of waste made in
violation of this chapter.
   (E)   Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases or rents the

Attorney shall deem appropriate to pursue.
   (H)   Administrative enforcement. In addition to any other actions or
remedies authorized in this chapter, the Director is hereby authorized to
enforce this chapter through the exercise of any one or more of the following
administrative actions and, unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, the
selection or use of one action or remedy by the Director shall not be construed
to limit the authority of the Director to pursue any other enforcement action
or remedy nor require the pursuit of a particular action or remedy as a
condition precedent to the use of any other action or remedy:
      (1)   Notice of violation (NOV). Whenever the Director determines that
any person has violated or is violating this chapter, the conditions of any
wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this chapter, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the Director may, but shall not be required, to serve
upon the person a written notice of violation describing the violation and the
actions required to correct the same. The notice of violation shall inform the
recipient that, within 14 calendar days of receipt thereof, the person
receiving same shall provide to the Director an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific actions for correction of the violation; provided, however, that:
         (a)   Submission of the proposed corrective plan shall in no form or
manner relieve the user of criminal or civil liability for violations of this
chapter whether before or after receipt of the notice of violation; and
         (b)   Nothing in this division (H)(1) shall be construed to limit the
authority of the Director to pursue any other enforcement action or remedy,
including, without limitation, the emergency actions the Director determines to
be necessary, without first issuing a notice of violation.
      (2)   Assurances of voluntary compliance. The Director is hereby
authorized to enter into assurances of voluntary compliance, consent orders or
similar documents establishing an agreement for voluntary compliance with any
person responsible for a violation of this chapter. The documents shall
describe the violation determined to exist, the specific actions agreed to be
taken by the person to correct the noncompliance and the time period for
completion of the corrective actions specified. The assurance of voluntary
compliance, consent order or similar document evidencing the intent of the
responsible person to ameliorate voluntarily the described violations of this
chapter shall be signed and dated by the person responsible for compliance and
shall be judicially enforceable; provided, however, that, in the event of
noncompliance with an assurance of voluntary compliance, consent order or
similar document, the Director may pursue any procedure available under this
chapter or otherwise to enforce compliance. An assurance of voluntary
compliance, consent order or similar document shall not include terms limiting
or restricting the actions or remedies available for violations of this chapter
or the terms of the instrument.
      (3)   Show cause hearing. The Director may order any person responsible
for a violation of this chapter, the conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the
Director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the person responsible for a violation specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the nature of the violation and enforcement
action proposed, the reasons for the action and a request that the person show
cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice of the
show cause hearing shall be served in person or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, at least three calendar days prior to the hearing. The
notice may be served upon any employee, agent or other authorized
representative of the person responsible for the violation. Whether or not the
person appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued
following the noticed hearing date; provided, however, a show cause hearing
shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the person;
and, provided, further, that, the issuance of a show cause notice shall not
prevent the Director from pursuing emergency actions if the Director determines
the actions are required to prevent pass through or other damage or
interference with the POTW.
      (4)   Compliance orders. When the Director determines that a person has
violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or the
conditions of a wastewater discharge permit or other order issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may issue an order
to the person responsible for the discharge directing that the person cure the
noncompliance within the time period and in the manner specified in the
compliance order. If the person does not comply within the time specified in
the compliance order, the Director may discontinue and disconnect water and/or
wastewater service to the noncomplying premises unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. The compliance order may also contain other and further requirements
as the Director shall deem necessary to protect the POTW or sanitary sewer
including, without limitation, additional self-monitoring, reporting and waste
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged
to the POTW. A compliance order issued hereunder may not extend a deadline for
compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement
established by federal law or by EPA order, regulation or otherwise. A
compliance order issued hereunder likewise shall not release the noncomplying
person of liability for any violation including, without limitation, any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order hereunder shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against the person.
      (5)   Cease and desist orders. When the Director determines that a person
is violating this chapter, the conditions of the person’s wastewater discharge
permit or other order issued hereunder, or that past violations committed by
the person are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order directing the
person to cease and desist immediately all violations and directing the person
to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements of this chapter, the
conditions of a wastewater discharge permit or other order issued hereunder;
and
         (b)   Take remedial or preventive action as may be needed to address
properly a present, continuing or threatened violation including, without
limitation, the halting of operations and/or termination of the wastewater
discharge to the POTW through disconnection or otherwise. Issuance of a cease
and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against
the noncomplying person hereunder.
      (6)   Civil penalties. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
chapter, if:
         (a)   A person has received actual notice of the provisions of this
chapter; and
         (b)   After the person received notice of the provisions of this
chapter, the person committed or continued acts in violation of this chapter or
failed to take action necessary for compliance with this chapter, the City
Attorney may initiate a suit against the owner, occupant or manager of premises
that are in violation of this chapter, to recover a civil penalty not to exceed
$5,000 per day for each violation. Each day or fractional part thereof that the
noncompliance continues shall constitute a separate violation for which civil
penalties shall accrue under this chapter. A suit for civil penalties hereunder
shall not prevent nor be a prerequisite for taking any other action against a
person in violation of this chapter. The suit may also include therein a
request for other and further relief as the City Attorney shall deem advisable
including, without limitation, an action for injunction or claim for damages to
recover for expenses, loss or damage to city property occasioned by reason of
the violation.
      (7)   Emergency suspensions. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
if the Director determines that an actual or threatened discharge reasonably
appears to present an imminent danger to the health, safety and welfare of
persons or property, or presents an imminent danger of pass-through or other
threat to the environment, or otherwise threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, the Director, upon verbal or written notice to the
person responsible for the discharge, may immediately suspend water and/or
wastewater service to the discharging premises and initiate emergency measures
to halt or prevent the discharge by disconnection from the city’s wastewater
system or otherwise. Any person notified of the suspension of its discharge
shall immediately cease the discharge or eliminate its contribution to the
wastestream. If the person responsible for the discharge fails to comply
immediately with the emergency suspension order, the Director may immediately
undertake all necessary measures to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, to
the environment or to persons or property including, without limitation,
immediate severance of sewer connection(s). Unless further proceedings for
termination of the discharge have been initiated, the Director may allow
recommencement of the discharge when the responsible person has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed.
Permission to recommence the discharge shall not constitute a waiver of the
city’s right to pursue criminal or civil penalties or other relief authorized
hereunder. Prior to recommencement of the suspended discharge, the person
responsible for the discharge shall submit for the approval of the Director a
detailed report describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures
implemented to prevent the future recurrence of the conditions causing the
imminent endangerment. Nothing herein shall be construed to require a hearing
prior to an emergency suspension under this part.
      (8)   Termination of discharge.
         (a)   In the event the Director determines that a person has violated
the provisions of this chapter, the conditions of its wastewater discharge
permit or other order(s) issued hereunder, the Director may:
            1.   Order the person to terminate its discharge to the POTW; and
            2.   Enforce termination of the discharge by severance of the sewer
connection(s).
         (b)   Termination of discharge and severance of the wastewater
connection to the POTW under this section shall be made only after satisfaction
of the procedures for a show cause hearing in accordance with the procedures
set out above.
      (9)   Termination of water supply. In the event the Director determines
that a person has violated this chapter, the conditions of its wastewater
discharge permit, or other order(s) issued hereunder, the Director may, in
addition to any other remedies available under this chapter, issued an order
terminating water service to this noncomplying person’s premises. Except in the
case of emergency, termination of water supply hereunder shall be made only
after satisfaction of the procedures for a show cause hearing set forth above.
      (10)   Publication of noncompliant users list. The Director shall publish
annually in a newspaper of general circulation in the city a list of the
industrial users that, during the previous 12 months, the Director determined
to be in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements of this chapter. For purposes of this division (H)(10),
SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE shall mean:
         (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here
as those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-
month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same
pollutant parameter by any amount;
         (b)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants, except
pH);
         (c)   A discharge violation that the Director believes has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through;
         (d)   A discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or that otherwise has resulted in the
city’s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent a discharge;
         (e)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or
otherwise attaining final compliance;
         (f)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
         (g)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and
         (h)   Any other violation which the city determines has or will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.

(Ord. 100921-A, passed 9-21-2010)
§ 53.19 DRAINAGE UTILITY CHARGE.
   (A)   Establishment of a drainage utility fee. A drainage utility charge is
hereby imposed upon each developed lot and parcel within the service area. For
purposes of imposing the drainage utility charge, all lots and parcels within
the city are classified into the following customer categories:
      (1)   Residential property; and
      (2)   Commercial Property.
   (B)   ERU value. The ERU value for the city is determined through an
inventory of all developed parcels in the city and determination of impervious
area for each parcel. Statistical and hydrologic evaluation of these data
determined that the equivalent residential unit impervious area value for
assigning fees to commercial properties is 3,350 square feet.
   (C)   Single-family residential rates. Based on statistical evaluation of
land parcel impervious area for the single-family customer category, three
rates are established for assignment of fees as follows:
      (1)   Tier 1 “Small”:      0.55 ERU,      <3,253 square feet impervious
area;
      (2)   Tier 2 “Average”:      1.00 ERU,      3,253-6,980 square feet
impervious area;
      (3)   Tier 3 “Large”:      1.70 ERU,      >6,980 square feet impervious
area.
   (D)   Commercial rates. Based on impervious area determination for each
parcel:
      (1)   Total ERU's = (Impervious Area/3,350 sq. ft.), minimum 1 ERU.
      (2)   The Total ERU shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.
   (E)   Calculation of drainage utility charge. The monthly drainage utility
charge for properties shall be calculated by multiplying the total number of
ERU's for the parcel by the ERU monthly billing rate.
   (F)   ERU monthly billing rate. The following ERU monthly billing rate is
hereby established and shall be used to calculate the total monthly drainage
utility charge for all property located in the city, in accordance with the
applicable formula established in this subsection:
      ERU rate = $4 per ERU per month.
   (G)   Impervious area determination. The City Administrator or his or her
designee shall be responsible for determining impervious area of property based
on reliable data, including geographic information system technology, aerial
photography, and other reliable means for determining impervious area. The City
Administrator may require additional information from the property owner,
tenant, or developer to make the determination. The amount of a charge may be
revised by the City Administrator based on any additions to the impervious area
through the city approved building permit process.
   (H)   Revision of rates. The City Council may review the schedule of charges
on an annual basis and may increase or decrease charges upon a determination
that an increase or decrease is warranted.
   (I)   No credit. No drainage utility charge credit shall be given for the
installation of drainage facilities required by the City Land Development Code
or state law.

fee shall be rendered by the city for all properties subject to the fee. Bills
shall be payable when rendered and shall be considered as received by the
customer, whether actually received or not, when deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the utility customer. Bills shall be
rendered monthly for the previous month's service.
   (B)   Fees; multiple users and users without utility account. For any parcel
for which there is more than one user who receives utility services from an
individual utility account or one or more users for whom a utility account is
not established, each user's fee shall be based upon the relative contribution
to runoff of the parcel controlled by that user.
   (C)   Bills due and payable. Bills are due and payable on the date specified
thereon and if full payment is not made by the date specified, it shall become
delinquent. The city shall have the right to apply interest of 10% per month to
amounts delinquent.
   (D)   Bill with other public utility billings. Drainage utility fees shall
be billed with the city's other public utility billings and shall be identified
separately on the bill as a drainage utility fee. Delinquent drainage utility
fee bills shall be mailed to the user at the address at which the user receives
other city utility services, or if no other city utility services are received,
to any known address for the owner or user.
   (E)   Penalties for failure to pay. Any charge due hereunder which is not
paid when due will subject the user to discontinuance of all utility services
provided by the city. Drainage utility fees that become delinquent pursuant to
this section shall be subject to a penalty in the amount of $5 to cover
administrative costs. Any drainage charge due hereunder which is not paid when

establishing the conditions is on the applicant. No variance shall be granted
unless the Council finds that all of the following criteria are met:

safeguards; or
         (c)   Deny a variance request.
      (6)   Conditions and limitations imposed by Council. The Council may
impose such conditions, limitations and safeguards as it deems appropriate upon
the granting of any variance. Violation of any condition, limitation or
safeguard shall constitute a violation of the prohibition on parking applicable
to the affected street. The Council may require a reasonable guarantee and
evidence that the applicant will satisfy any conditions imposed in connection
with approval of a variance. A variance is not transferable.

place the offense occurred.
   (G)   Signage; presumption. The Director of Public Works of the city shall
cause the installation of signs, in compliance with applicable regulations for
traffic signage, to the extent the signage is not already installed. The signs
shall be installed in a manner as to give notice to operators of motor vehicles
of the prohibition on parking established by this chapter. The areas indicated
by signs existing at the time of amendment of this chapter or installed under
the direction of the Director of Public Works in conformance with the amendment
of this chapter shall conclusively be presumed to delineate the areas where
parking is prohibited.
   (H)   Residential parking permits. The Chief of Police may issue three
residential parking permits to the residents of each house located on that part
of a street for which parking is limited to those displaying a valid
residential parking permit at any time(s), as provided in this Schedule I.
Requests for residential parking permits shall be submitted to the Chief of
Police or his or her designee. The address of a person requesting residential
parking permits shall be verified by a current utility bill, auto registration

§ 91.03 UNREASONABLE NOISE PROHIBITED; ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be a nuisance and it shall be unlawful for
any person, between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the following morning
to:
      (1)   Own, harbor, keep or have control of one or more animals on
premises owned, leased or controlled by the person, which animal(s) make any
unreasonably loud or disturbing noise;
      (2)   Cause any unreasonably loud or disturbing noise by any musical
instrument, radio, sound amplifying equipment, explosive or by any other means;
or
      (3)   Permit or allow on property owned, leased or controlled by the
person any unreasonably loud or disturbing noise by any musical instrument,
radio, sound amplifying equipment, explosive or by any other means; which noise
either:
         (a)   Causes material distress, discomfort or injury to persons of
ordinary sensibilities in the immediate vicinity thereof; or
         (b)   Substantially interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of
private home(s) by person(s) of ordinary sensibilities.
   (B)   The following acts, among those specified in division (A) above and
among others unspecified, are declared to be nuisances in violation of this
chapter, but the enumerations shall not be deemed to be exclusive, to wit:
      (1)   The use of any sound amplifying equipment of the intensity that
disturbs persons of ordinary sensibilities in the immediate vicinity thereof;
      (2)   The continued or frequent sounding of any horn or signal device on
any motor vehicle, except as a danger or warning signal;
      (3)   The running of any motor vehicle that is so out of repair, so
loaded or is operated in a manner as to create loud, grating grinding, jarring
or rattling noise; and
      (4)   The discharge into the open air of the exhaust of any steam engine,
stationary internal combustion engine or motor vehicle engine, except through a
muffler or other device which will effectively prevent loud or explosive noises
therefrom.
   (C)   As the city desires to preserve its rural environment, reasonable
sounds made by domestic animals, including cows, sheep, chickens, goats,
horses, dogs, cats and other animals kept and maintained for personal, non-
commercial purposes shall not constitute a violation of division (A)(1) above.
   (D)   The following shall be among the criteria considered for the purpose
of determining the reasonableness of noise made by animals:
      (1)   The volume and pitch of the sound(s);
      (2)   Whether the noise is habitual or recurring;
      (3)   Whether the noise is encouraged or induced by the owner, possessor
or one controlling the animal(s); and
      (4)   The proximity of the noise to any residence, business or person
complaining of the noise.
   (E)   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any noise other than an
animal noise measured at a level in excess of 65 dBA of sound pressure measured
at or beyond any point on a real property boundary line for a total five
minutes out of any hour, whether continuously or intermittently, shall
constitute an unreasonable noise in violation of this chapter.
   (F)   Agents of the City Police Department are authorized, upon receiving a
written complaint by any person affected by any alleged unreasonable noise, to
notify the one alleged to have violated this chapter in writing of any
complaint(s) and request voluntary compliance with this chapter. If voluntary

condition. In the event that the person making the opening shall fail to leave
the highway, street, right-of-way, or easement in a good state of repair,
satisfactory to the city, then the city shall call upon the sureties to pay for
the cost of repairing the highway; provided however, that in the event of a
cash deposit instead of a bond, the city may proceed to have the street, other
highway, right-of-way, or easement, put in good condition, paying for same out
of the deposit made by him or her, and if there be any remainder of the deposit
after paying for the work, the remainder shall be refunded to the person making
the deposit.
   (C)   Before a permit may be issued hereunder, the applicant must comply
with all provisions of this subchapter pertinent to the issuance of such a
permit, including but not limited to §
92.07 below, if applicable. Also before a permit may be issued, in addition to
the performance bond required in division (A), the applicant must take out and
maintain, at its own expense, comprehensive general liability insurance
included but not limited to premises-operations and completed operations
coverage, covering the obligations assumed by the applicant in not less than

      (2)   Property damages: $500,000 each occurrence; $500,000 aggregate.
   (D)   Any policy providing for the above-required insurance shall name the
city as an additional named insured and shall contain a provision that the
policy may not be cancelled, terminated or modified without 15-days’ written
advance notice thereof to the city.
   (E)   Cancellation of insurance will automatically cause the suspension of
the permit for 30 days unless reinstated insurance is furnished. Suspended
permits shall be automatically canceled at the end of 30 days.
   (F)   When the bond or deposit and insurance required by this section shall
have been accepted by the city, and all other applicable provisions relevant to
the granting of permits have been satisfied, the city shall issue a permit for
the excavation set out in the application, and the applicant may then proceed
with the work in the exact location named in its application, and in no other
place.

§ 110.03 LICENSE, REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   Unlawful to operate without license. It shall be unlawful for any

   (B)   Registration.
      (1)   All tow companies who perform non-consent tows in the city shall
first submit a registration to the City Police Department on a form provided by

§ 110.04 TOW ROTATION LIST.
   The City Police Department has established and maintains a tow rotation

the tow rotation list.
   (A)   Qualifications. To be qualified for inclusion on the tow rotation list
a tow company must:
      (1)   Maintain a 24-hour tow service;
      (2)   Have not less than one telephone number which is answered 24 hours
a day, seven days a week;
      (3)   Use a VSF for storage of any vehicle towed in the city that meets
or exceeds the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility criteria

   (B)   Restrictions. Only those tow trucks that are included on the tow
company’s tow truck license are authorized to respond to a rotation call. Only
those persons identified in a registration submitted to the City Police
Department are authorized to perform a tow pursuant to the city’s tow rotation
list procedure. A tow company may not substitute a tow truck owned or operated
by another person when responding to a dispatch. A list of authorized drivers
and trucks will be in each patrol vehicle.
   (C)   Forfeiture of calls. Failure of any tow rotation list participant to
respond to the location dispatched by the city within 40 minutes of being
called will result in the forfeiture of that call. A tow company may not

from the tow rotation list for a specific period of time, the tow company shall
notify the City Police Department. It shall be the tow company’s responsibility
to notify the Police Department of the date when the tow company wishes to be
restored to the tow rotation list.

police officer and subsequently is not needed, that tow company will be placed
as “next in line” on the tow rotation list.
   (F)   Fee for being on the tow rotation list. A tow company desiring to be
placed on the tow rotation list shall pay an annual administrative fee of $200
to defray the cost of administering, updating and maintaining the tow rotation
list. This fee shall not be prorated or refundable.
   (G)   Violations.
      (1)   A tow truck driver with more than four violations of traffic laws
in the prior two years will not be permitted to respond to calls for service. A
tow company shall notify the City Police Department whenever a driver
authorized on the tow company’s registration exceeds the allowed number of
violations.
      (2)   The City Police Department may from time to time investigate the
driver record of authorized listed drivers.

110.99
§ 110.21 VEHICLE STORAGE FACILITY.

(Ord. 090127, passed 1-27-2009) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.22 SOLICITING TOWING BUSINESS ON CITY STREET PROHIBITED.
   No tow company shall solicit in any manner, directly or indirectly, a person
owning/operating any vehicle which is wrecked or involved in a traffic accident
on a public street. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the
solicitation is for the purpose of soliciting business of towing, repairing,
selling or purchasing the vehicle.
(Ord. 090127, passed 1-27-2009) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.23 DUTIES OF TOW COMPANIES.
   It shall be the obligation of all tow companies performing tows in the city
to operate the tow business in the city in a safe manner, to include, but not
limited to, the following.
   (A)   Taking direction from investigating officer. Upon arrival at the scene
of a collision within the city, tow truck operators shall take directions from
the police officer investigating the collision.
   (B)   Removing debris of collision. Tow truck operators that engage and tow
any vehicle from the scene of a collision within the city shall remove all
debris (other than hazardous materials) of the collision from the public
street. This duty specifically includes the removal of vehicle parts, glass and
other debris. The debris shall be disposed of in a lawful manner which will
keep it out of the gutters, storm sewers, streams, public right-of-way or
property not belonging to the tow company.
   (C)   Disengaging. A tow truck that removes a vehicle from the original
location shall not disengage from the vehicle until the vehicle has been
deposited with the appropriate VSF, except when the vehicle is released to the
owner or operator or when the owner or operator specifies the location of
disengagement. This restriction is enacted to prohibit tow trucks from engaging
an unauthorized vehicle in a parking facility and moving it to a close
location, then returning for another unauthorized vehicle, ultimately towing
all the relocated vehicles to a VSF.
   (D)   Drops. A stationary tow truck that has connected a vehicle shall
release the vehicle to its owner or operator upon payment of the “drop fee” and
will not tow the vehicle, except when the vehicle is being taken into custody
by a police officer. A vehicle is “connected” if it is at least partially
attached to the tow truck or when skates/dollies have been placed under the
vehicle. A vehicle is not “connected” if the tow truck has merely backed up to
the vehicle.
   (E)   Response while impaired prohibited. No driver of a wrecker shall
respond to a dispatch when he or she is under the influence of alcoholic
beverages, controlled substances or is otherwise impaired.
   (F)   Proficiency. All operators and wrecker drivers on the rotation list
shall be proficient and competent in the operation of the wrecker, as
determined by state law.
   (G)   Reflective wear required. All tow truck drivers shall wear reflective
vests, coats or shirts while on the scene of any dispatch. These vests will be
in compliance with TDLR requirements.
   (H)   Notification of make and model. Tow companies shall notify the City
Police Department of the make and model of the vehicle towed and the location
from which the vehicle was towed at the time the tow is effected, unless the
tow company was dispatched pursuant to the tow rotation list procedure.
   (I)   Felony offenses. No person convicted a felony offense in the prior
five years shall make a non-consent tow in the city.
(Ord. 090127, passed 1-27-2009) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   In addition to criminal penalties provided in this chapter, a tow
company registered on the tow rotation list may be subject to sanctions for a
violation of a provision of this chapter, depending on the nature of
infraction, number of infractions, culpability of the tow company for the
actions of its drivers and other circumstances. The sanctions shall be
determined by the City Chief of Police. The sanctions may range from warning,
to suspension or termination of the registration to participate in the tow
rotation list. The level of sanction shall be determined by the severity of the
offense, whether the tow company has any prior violations and whether the
conduct indicates a likelihood of a repeat offense, all in consideration of the
continuing safety and convenience of the public. The tow company will be given
advance notice of the sanction to be imposed and will be permitted to make a
written presentation to the Chief of Police prior to enforcement of the
sanction. The Chief of Police shall have the final decision as to the action
taken. The Chief of Police may elect to present the findings to the City Public
Safety Committee for a recommendation prior to making a final decision.
   (B)   A violation of this chapter shall be a Class C misdemeanor punishable
by fine up to a maximum of $500.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter and all its respective subchapters shall collectively be known
and may be cited as the Land Development Code of the City of Sunset Valley, or
simply as the Land Development Code. The Land Development Code codifies all
ordinances regulating the development and use of real property subject to the
planning jurisdiction of the City of Sunset Valley.
§ 150.002 PURPOSES.
   The Land Development Code is adopted for the following reasons:
   (A)   To protect and promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare
of the community of the City of Sunset Valley;
   (B)   To ensure the safe, orderly, and healthful development and expansion
of the City of Sunset Valley, in accordance with and pursuant to the
Comprehensive Plan of the City of Sunset Valley;
   (C)   To maintain the environmental balance of the area;
   (D)   To conserve, develop, protect, and utilize natural resources, as
appropriate and consistent with the public welfare and interest;
   (E)   To prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue concentration of
population;
   (F)   To lessen congestion in the streets and provide convenient, safe, and
efficient circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and enable emergency
vehicles to safely and speedily reach their destinations;
   (G)   To facilitate the adequate provisions of transportation, water,
wastewater, schools, parks, and other public requirements;
   (H)   To secure safety from fire, flooding, panic, and other dangers;
   (I)   To provide adequate light and clean air;
   (J)   To promote tranquility and the preservation of the rustic character of
the flora and fauna within the city's jurisdiction.
   (K)   To promote economic development through an efficient and practical
means by which development can proceed in compliance with the provisions of the
Land Development Code and other applicable laws; and
   (L)   To protect the Edwards Aquifer and the city's drinking water supply
and prevent excessive pollutant loadings in creeks.
§ 150.003 AUTHORITY.
   The Land Development Code is adopted pursuant to the powers granted to the
city and subject to any limitations imposed by the Constitution and laws of the
state of Texas. No provision of this Land Development Code shall be construed
as relieving any party from any other provision of state or federal law or from
any provision, ordinance, rule, or regulation of the city requiring a license,
franchise, or permit to accomplish, engage in, carry on, or maintain a
particular business, enterprise, occupation, transaction or use.
§ 150.004 JURISDICTION.
   The provisions of this Land Development Code apply to all property located
within the incorporated city limits of the City of Sunset Valley as such limits
may increase or decrease from time to time through annexation or disannexation.
In addition, and to the extent permitted by state law, the provisions of this
Land Development Code apply to all property located within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the City of Sunset Valley.
§ 150.005 RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
   It is the intention of the City Council of the City of Sunset Valley in
adopting this Land Development Code, and any amendments thereto, that the Land
Development Code implements the duly adopted planning policies of the
Comprehensive Plan. The City Council hereby expresses its intent that this Land
Development Code, and any amendments thereto, shall be construed in a manner to
give effect to its purpose and to the adopted Comprehensive Plan. It is further
the Council's intent that no provision of this Land Development Code shall be
declared void by any court except when the provision irreconcilably conflicts
with the adopted Comprehensive Plan. Any person who alleges the existence of an
irreconcilable conflict between the adopted Comprehensive Plan and a provision
of this Land Development Code shall first provide the City Council a reasonable
opportunity to act to resolve the alleged conflict.
§ 150.006 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   Words used in this Code and not defined herein shall have the
meaning established by Texas statutory or case law or, if not defined in Texas
law, their ordinarily accepted meaning.

the person employed or appointed by the city in that position, or his duly

      (4)   Advise that to request a hearing, a written application therefor
must be filed with the City Secretary within ten days of receipt of the notice
provided for herein; and
      (5)   Advise that if no hearing is requested within said ten days, and if
the required corrective work is not completed within the 30-day period
specified in the notice, the permit shall be revoked.
   (D)   If no hearing is requested and if the required corrective action is
not completed within the time specified by the city, the permit shall be
revoked and shall be void and of no effect as if it had never been issued. No
work shall be done in connection with the project for which the permit was
issued except as thereafter expressly directed or authorized by the city.
   (E)   Hearing before the City Council.
      (1)   If a hearing has been requested within ten days of receipt of the
notice by the filing of a written application therefor with the City Secretary,
the City Council shall, no later than 30 days after receipt of said request,
hold a hearing to determine whether the permittee is in noncompliance or if
some other reason recognized by law exists which would warrant the revocation
of the permit and whether the permit should be revoked. Written notice of the
date, time and place of the hearing shall be given to the permittee and, if not
the same person, the owner of the property.
      (2)   If, after hearing, the City Council determines that the permittee
is in noncompliance or that such other condition exists that would warrant
revocation of the permit, and that the permit should be revoked, it shall order
that the necessary corrective action be completed within such time as the
Council directs. If the work is not so completed, the permit shall be revoked,
and shall be void and of no effect as if it had never been issued. No further
work shall be done in connection with the project for which the permit was
issued except as thereafter expressly directed or authorized by the city.
   (F)   Inspections.
      (1)   In addition to any inspection authorized or required pursuant to
any city ordinance or sections of this Code in connection with the issuance of
a permit, the city is authorized to enter upon any property to which a permit
relates at any reasonable hour to inspect the work for which the permit was
issued. If the property is occupied, the city's representative shall first
present credentials and request entry. If the property is vacant, the city's
representative shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or
other persons who have charge or control of the property and request that entry
be granted.
      (2)   If the owner, occupant or person in control refuses to grant the
city's representative entry, and the city has reasonable cause to believe that
the permittee is in non-compliance as that term is defined in this section of
the Code, the city's representative shall seek and obtain a search warrant from
the Municipal Court Judge, the purpose of which is to determine whether or not
the permittee is in non-compliance, before entering upon the property.
   (G)   Extensions. The city may grant such extensions of time as it deems
appropriate to those permittees who have made a reasonable effort to comply
with the city's directives.
   (H)   Application. The provisions of this section shall apply to the
revocation of permits issued by the city pursuant to ordinances which do not
include therein any specific procedure for permit revocation.
   (I)   Recovery of costs.
      (1)   The city may, upon notice to the permittee, retain such experts,
including but not limited to engineers, sanitarians, hydrologists and
attorneys, to advise and represent the city in connection with its
determination that a permittee is in non-compliance, as that term is defined
herein and/or, that a permit should be revoked. In the event that the city does
determine that a permittee is in non-compliance and the permit is finally
revoked, the permittee shall reimburse the city for the reasonable costs
incurred in connection with the retention of such experts.
      (2)   In addition to any other method allowed by law pursuant to which
the city can recover the costs it incurs in connection with the permit
revocation proceedings, including those authorized by division (I)(1) above,
the city may, at its discretion, collect on any bond or letter of credit
required of the permittee.
      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to limit the remedies available
to the city.

VARIANCES, ZONING CHANGES AND ZONING AMENDMENTS AND APPEALS FROM ADMINISTRATIVE
ACTION.

regulation.
      (1)   Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Code with regard
to special use permits, the Zoning Commission and City Council shall hold a
public hearing on an application for a special use permit, zoning
classification change, and on proposed general amendments to the zoning
provisions of this Code initiated by the City Council before acting thereon.
The Zoning Commission shall hold a hearing on an application for a special use
permit or zoning classification change within 45 days of the date of the filing
of an administratively complete application that requires action for
recommendation by the Zoning Commission. The City Council shall hold a hearing
on an application for a special use permit or a zoning classification change
within 45 days after the Zoning Commission has issued a recommendation on the
matter or has issued a report of no recommendation.
      (2)   Notice.
         (a)   By publication. The city shall cause notice of each public
hearing to be published once in an official newspaper or in a newspaper of
general circulation in Sunset Valley at least 15 days prior to the date set for
such hearing. The notice shall state the time and place of the hearing and
contain a description of the matter to be considered, including its nature,
scope and location. The notice shall also describe any other concurrent actions
the applicant has requested and shall state the location and times of which the
application and supporting documents are available for public inspection.
         (b)   Written notice to property owners. When the public hearing is to
consider a proposed special use permit, or zoning classification change
affecting a specific property, written notice of such hearing shall be given to
the owners of all real property located within 500 feet of the property on
which the action is proposed. However, if the proposed amendment does not
include a proposed change in zoning classification (including changes in
applicable conditional overlays) or a special use permit applicable to a
specific property, no notice is required to be mailed to specific property
owners. Where the subject property requesting the action constitutes a unit of
a larger tract owned by the applicant, written notice of such hearing shall be
given to the owners of all real property located within 500 feet of the
property line of the larger tract. Notice shall be given not less than 15 days
before the date set for the hearing either by personal service or by depositing
a copy of the notice in the mail addressed to each owner at the address shown
on the last approved city tax roll. Such written notice shall be in addition to
notice by publication and shall contain the same information.
         (c)   Sign on property being considered for a special use permit or
zoning classification change amendment. The city shall cause one or more signs
to be erected in conspicuous locations on property for which a special use
permit, or change of zoning classification has been requested. Such signs shall

public hearings before the Zoning Commission and City Council and shall remain
until final disposition of the request by the city. Each sign shall describe
the nature of the proposed action, and indicate the time, date, and place of
the public hearing before the Zoning Commission or City Council and the time
and place for public inspection of the application or proposal. No action taken
by the Zoning Commission or the City Council shall be affected by any failure
to comply with this section. The city may require the applicant to arrange the
placement of required signage or may place the required signage on the affected
property and charge the applicant the reasonable cost of such signage. If the
city places the required signage on the property, the applicant's cooperation
in placement of such signage on the affected property shall be a condition to
review and action on the application.
      (3)   Joint hearing on multiple applications. Applications for special
use permits, site plan zoning changes, zoning amendments and zoning approvals
which involve the same development may be considered together, before either
the Zoning Commission, the City Council, or both, at a single hearing, rather
than at a separate hearing for each related application.
      (4)   Concurrent applications. An application for a zoning classification
change may be filed concurrently with an application for a conceptual site
plan, but shall be approved only after the latter applications have been
approved. Tentative maps may be processed concurrently with a zoning
classification amendment. Special use permits may be processed concurrently
with a zoning classification change, but may not be approved until after the
zoning classification change has been approved.

         (b)   An appeal is commenced by the filing of a notice of appeal with
the Board of Adjustment and the administrative official from whom the appeal is
taken, specifying the grounds of the appeal. Filing of the notice of appeal is
complete when delivered to the City Secretary for the Board of Adjustment and
to the City Administrator for the administrative official. The notice of appeal
must be filed not later than the twentieth day after the date of the decision
that is the subject of the appeal.
         (c)   The administrative official from whom the appeal is taken shall
immediately transmit to the Board of Adjustment all papers constituting the
record of the appealed action.
         (d)   The hearing of the appeal shall be set in a reasonable time
following public notice. Public notice for an appeal that does not relate to a
specific application, address, or project, shall be provided in accordance with
§
150.060(A)(2)(b) to the appealing party and the affected administrative
official. Public notice for an appeal that is related to a specific
application, address, or project, shall be provided in accordance with §

order for a zoning classification change requested by a property owner to be
recommended for approval, the Zoning Commission must find that in its opinion,
each of the following conditions have been established by competent evidence.
The burden of establishing such conditions is on the applicant.
            1.   The proposed change in zoning classification is consistent
with the goals, standards and policies of the City's Comprehensive Plan; and
            2.   Significant unanticipated changes have occurred that make
development with the current land use maps unlikely and inappropriate;
            3.   The proposed classification will allow uses that are
reasonable and not incompatible with surrounding properties and that any minor
incompatible effects of uses to be allowed will be adequately mitigated;
            4.   The zoning classification change requested is no greater than
the minimum required to allow for reasonable use of the land;
            5.   The proposed change in zoning classification is in the
community's best interest in terms of the public health, safety and welfare;
            6.   Development likely to occur as a result of the proposed change
in zoning classification can be served adequately by utilities, water supply
systems, waste water systems, and drainage facilities;
            7.   Development likely to occur as a result of the proposed change
in zoning classification can be served adequately by the following services:
police protection, fire protection, and emergency medical care;
            8.   Development likely to occur as a result of the proposed change
in zoning classification will not result in traffic conditions or vehicular
circulation that jeopardizes the city's public health, safety, welfare,
environment, or the vehicular traffic goals, standards and policies of the
Comprehensive Land Use Plan;
            9.   Development likely to occur as a result of the proposed change
in zoning classification will not disrupt the existing uses of land in the
vicinity; and
            10.   The proposed change in zoning classification and development
likely to occur as a result of the proposed change in zoning classification
will not negatively affect the value of property and improvements in the
vicinity.
         (b)   Conditions required for a change in zoning category initiated by
the City Council.
            1.   In order for a land use regulation change to be approved, the
Council must find that the change is consistent with each of the applicable
purposes set forth in §

minimum, the proposed change is consistent with each of the applicable purposes
set forth in §
150.080.
   (F)   Interpretative rules applicable to all applications for amendment by
an owner of property.
      (1)   Amendments should be granted sparingly.
      (2)   When considering requests to change zoning classification, zoning
classification changes that have been granted previously in the vicinity are
relevant to, but not determinative of the granting of such request, and
pecuniary hardship, standing alone, shall not be deemed sufficient to grant the
requested change.
   (G)   Recommendation by the Zoning Commission.
      (1)   No amendment to the zoning provisions of this Code, whether on
request of an owner of property or initiated by the City Council, shall be
enacted without a recommendation from the Zoning Commission.

Commission shall deliver a written recommendation of action to the Council. The
Zoning Commission may postpone action on an amendment requested by an owner of
property up to 60 days following the public hearing if additional information
or assessment is required. The Commission shall not recommend an amendment
requested by an owner of property unless it finds, based on competent evidence,
that each of the conditions in § 150.064(E)(4)(a) has been established.
Findings of the Zoning Commission, together with the specific facts upon which
such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the written recommendation
by the Zoning Commission. With regard to an amendment requested by an owner of
property the Zoning Commission may recommend that the Council:
         (a)   Approve the amendment request;
         (b)   Approve the amendment request with conditions, limitations and
safeguards; or
         (c)   Deny the amendment request.
   (H)   Review and action by Council.
      (1)   Notice and hearing. The City Council shall hold at least one public
hearing on all proposed amendments to this Code before acting thereon in
accordance with §
150.060. At the City Council's discretion, the hearing before the City Council
may be combined with the hearing on the same matter before the Zoning
Commission.
      (2)   Council action. Council action on an application may include:
         (a)   Approval of the recommendation of the Zoning Commission. This
action requires a majority vote of the City Council members present;
         (b)   Overrule the recommendation of the Zoning Commission to grant an
amendment requested by an owner of property or an amendment initiated by the
City Council. This action requires the approval of three-fourths of the City
Council members present;
         (c)   Modify, add, or subtract terms or conditions of a recommendation
of the Zoning Commission for approval of an amendment requested by an owner of
property or initiated by the City Council. This action requires a majority vote
of the City Council members present; or
         (d)   Overrule a recommendation by the Zoning Commission denying a
request for amendment by an owner of property. This action requires the
approval of three-quarters of the City Council members present.
         (e)   Regardless how a proposed change is initiated, if the city has
received a written protest from 20% of the owners subject to the proposed
change, or, in the case of an amendment affecting a specific property, from 20%
of the owners of property within 200 feet of the specific affected property
(where the amendment request constitutes a unit of a larger tract owned by the
applicant, 200 feet from the property line of the larger tract), approval of
action requires a favorable vote of three-quarters of all members of the City
Council. In computing the percentage of land area under this division, the area
of streets and alleys shall be included.
   (I)   Finality of action. The Council's decision shall become final on the
effective date of its action. The action taken by the City Council cannot be
reconsidered, unless substantive information not available to the Council when
it originally made its decision is presented that significantly impacts the
Council's decision.
§ 150.065 SUSPENDING ISSUANCE OF PERMITS AND APPROVALS.
   No application for site plan approval shall be accepted for filing nor be
processed and no building, site clearance, or grading permit shall be issued
for any work, other than in connection with a single family residential use,
for a period not to exceed 90 days, on land which is being considered for a
change in zoning classification, such 90-day period to begin on the date the
City Council submits the proposed zoning change to the Zoning Commission for a
report and recommendation. Properties which have received preliminary or final
site plan approval prior to such date are excepted.
§ 150.066 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Intent. To provide a vehicle for relief from the provisions of this
Code when strict compliance would cause undue hardship due to unusual
circumstances or conditions peculiar to the subject property, such as size,
shape, topography, location, or surroundings. The Board will grant no variance
that it finds to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare of the
community. The applicant bears the burden of establishing the requisite special
circumstances or peculiar conditions.
   (B)   Application requirements. An application for a variance shall be made
in writing in a form prescribed by the Board of Adjustment and shall be
accompanied by:
      (1)   A non-refundable deposit or fee as set forth by ordinance of the
City Council;
      (2)   A letter of justification describing the proposed project and
explaining how it satisfies the conditional findings described in division (F)
of this section (See
Appendix A);
      (3)   A conceptual site plan;
      (4)   A detailed site plan (see
Appendix B) may be required by the Board of Adjustment, and shall be required
in such cases where an owner of real property located within 500 feet of the
property on which the change in classification is proposed makes such written
request; and
      (5)   Any other relevant information requested by the Board of Adjustment
in order to properly review the application. Such information may include, but
is not limited to plat plans, site building plans, a traffic impact study,
contour/drainage maps, a surface geological assessment, or a report of the
impact that the variance could have on the environment.
   (C)   Report of administrative completeness. The City Secretary or city
designee shall review each application for administrative completeness. After
receipt of a complete application, the City Secretary or city designee shall
cause to occur within five working days:

requested at any time during the review process in order to properly review the
application. Such information may include, but is not limited to preliminary
plat plans, site buildings plans, a traffic impact study, contour maps, or a
report of the geological survey impact the variance may have on the
environment.
         (d)   If applicable, whether the requested amendment conforms to the
Existing or Future Land Use Map of the City of Sunset Valley Comprehensive
Plan; and
      (2)   One copy of an organized packet of information containing a copy of
the application, all application submittals and all correspondence to and from
the applicant to be delivered to the City Secretary to be distributed to
Members of the Board of Adjustment and Zoning Commission.
   (D)   On-site inspection. Upon the request of: a) the applicant; b) any
member of the Board of Adjustment, Zoning Commission or City Council; or c) a
property owner within 500 feet of the subject property, city representatives
shall visit the site where the proposed variance will apply and the surrounding
area and shall report his/her findings to the Board of Adjustment and the
city's other governing bodies.
   (E)   Hearing and notice. The Board of Adjustment shall hold at least one
public hearing on all variance applications in accordance with the procedures
for public notice and hearing in §
150.060.
   (F)   Findings. Findings of the Board, together with the specific facts upon
which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes
of the Board meeting at which such action is taken. No variance shall be
granted unless the Board of Adjustment finds that all of the following criteria
are met:
      (1)   Special circumstances or conditions exist such that requiring
compliance with the provisions of the applicable zoning provisions of the Code
will cause significant practical difficulties or undue hardship to the
applicant. Pecuniary hardship to the applicant, standing alone, shall not be
deemed to constitute practical hardship.
      (2)   Special circumstances or conditions affecting the parcel of land
exist such that requiring strict compliance with the provisions of this Code
will result in one or more of the following:
         (a)   Depriving the applicant of the reasonable use of the applicant's
land;
         (b)   Significant or unreasonable disruption of the natural terrain;
         (c)   Significant or unreasonable destruction of the existing flora;

         (e)   Depriving the property owner of an essential legally protected
property right.
      (3)   There is no practical alternative to the requisite variance that
will alleviate the difficulty or hardship complained of or the requisite
variance enhances the quality of the project as a whole and would result in a
better project than requiring strict compliance with the provisions of the
Code;
      (4)   The variance will be no greater than the minimum required to
alleviate the difficulty or hardship;
      (5)   The granting of the variance will not have a negative effect on
other property or improvements in the area;
      (6)   The granting of the variance will not have a negative effect on the
ability to use nearby land in accordance with the Code; and
      (7)   The variance is in harmony with the intent of the Code's zoning
provisions and with the goals, standards and policies of the City's
Comprehensive Plan.
   (G)   Action by Board. The Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance
unless it finds, based on competent evidence, that each of the conditions in
division (F) has been established. The Board may, by concurring vote of at
least four members of the Board:
      (1)   Approve the variance request;
      (2)   Approve the variance request with conditions, limitations and
safeguards; or
      (3)   Deny a variance request.
   (H)   Conditions Imposed by Board.
      (1)   The Board may impose such conditions, limitations and safeguards as
it deems appropriate upon the granting of any variance. Violation of any such
condition, limitation or safeguard shall constitute a violation of this Code.
      (2)   The Board shall require reasonable guarantee and evidence that the
applicant, or its successors in interest, will satisfy any conditions imposed
in connection with approval of a variance.
      (3)   The applicant shall file the approved variance with the Travis
County Real Property Records for the subject property, and provide proof of
filing to the City Administrator.
      (4)   The applicant shall implement the variance as approved by the
Board.
      (5)   The power to grant variances does not extend to changing a parcel's
zoning districts, including the granting or denying of conditional overlays.
   (I)   Appeal. The Board's decision shall become final on the effective date
of its resolution or motion. The action taken by the Board of Adjustment on a
variance is final and cannot be reconsidered, unless substantive information
which was not available when the Board made its decision is presented which
could significantly impact the Board's decision. In accordance with state
statute by law, the applicant may judicially appeal the Board's decision in
accordance with state law.
   (J)   Time limits. Unless action is being diligently pursued, any rights
authorized by a variance which are not exercised within one year from the date
of granting such variance shall be conclusively presumed to have been withdrawn
by the applicant.
   (K)   Enforcement and revocation. Enforcement and revocation shall be in
accordance with §§
150.080 through
150.086, and other relevant provisions of this Code.

of streets, highways, alleys, or streams shall be construed to follow such
lines;
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines of
lots or other parcels of record shall be construed as following such lot lines;
   (C)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limit lines shall

shall be automatically extended to the center line of such vacated street,
alley or way and all areas so involved shall then and thenceforth be subject to
all regulations of the extended districts;

shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as provided in the penalty section
hereof.

notice and hearing, that a significant violation of an approved final site plan
has occurred, the Council may revoke its approval of such site plan. It shall
be unlawful for any person to do any work on the site covered by the site plan
unless and until a new application for site plan approval has been filed and
processed in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the Council grants
approval to a new final site plan which corrects the violations of the original
site plan.
   (C)   Injunction and other remedies. Any structure erected or used, or any
work done, contrary to any of the provisions of the zoning sections of this

mandamus, abatement, or any other action available in law or equity to prevent,
enjoin, abate, correct, or remove such unlawful structure, use, or work.
   (D)   Revocation of variance. If the Board of Adjustment finds, after notice

the approval was granted until such time that a new application which corrects
the inaccuracies has been filed and processed in accordance with the provisions

Highway Commercial Zoning and shall be effectively buffered from other
districts.
      (2)   An arterial roadway may be adjacent to a Single Family Residential
District when the Single Family Residential District is effectively buffered
from the roadway as described in this section.
      (3)   NC, Neighborhood Commercial Districts shall be adjacent only to
residential districts, O (Neighborhood Office) Districts, CO (Conditional
Overlay) Districts, GUI (Government, Utility and Institutional) Districts, or
HC (Highway Commercial) Districts.
      (4)   O, Neighborhood Office Districts shall be adjacent only to SF
(residential) areas (as shown above), a NC (Neighborhood Commercial) District,
a CO (Conditional Overlay) District, GUI (Governmental, Utility and
Institutional) District or a HC (Highway Commercial) District.

from major traffic ways.
   (B)   Effective compatibility and buffering standards.
      (1)   Effective buffering of residential districts from all other
districts, except P Districts, shall include a minimum 100 feet landscaped
setback. All buffering shall be fully contained within the property of the
district required to provide the buffering, and all requirements for buffering
shall be met within that same property. Credit for existing fences, screens,
vegetation, etc. adjacent to commercially zoned land but physically located on
lesser zoned land cannot be given. However, existing natural topographic
changes may be considered for their buffering effect, regardless of the
property on which it occurs. No roadways can be located within this setback.
The applicant cannot comply with landscaping requirements of this Code in this
buffer zone.
      (2)   Applicability. The standards and guidelines set forth in this
section shall apply to O, NC, HC, GUI or other commercial or governmental
zoning districts or land so conditionally zoned and located adjacent to any SF,
P, or other non-commercial zoned district.

shall be on the applicant. The use of plans, photographs, sections, elevations,
scale models, etc. may be employed as methods of demonstrating compliance. All
requirements for screening shall be met at the time of project (or phase)
completion. Maturation of vegetative screens is anticipated and is intended to
provide a continuing and greater level of screening than the initial
requirements.
      (4)   Compliance guidelines.
         (a)   Visual screening.
            1.   Intent: To partially or fully block views to or from SF
districts to or from any commercial or governmental district so as to minimize
the potential impact of commercial and governmental uses on the residents of
the city.
            2.   The "target point" of all buffering and screening from
commercial and/or governmental to residential districts shall be a point 30
feet horizontally from the rear property line, and 20 feet high. This "target"
is intended to approximate the theoretical position of view from a two-story
residential structure located along the rear setback of a residential or office
zoned lot.
            3.   Requirements: Views from the "target point" to the outlined
elements and/or heights shall be screened as set forth in Table A following
this section.
         (b)   Light screening.
            1.   Intent: Because lights, whether used for aesthetic or
functional illumination, can be a night time intrusion on the residents of the
city by creating glare and by detracting from the rural character of the city,
this guideline is intended to minimize the impact of lights on residential
properties in the city.
            2.   Requirements: Lighting shall be screened, maintained, and
operated in compliance with the criteria, standards and methods set forth in
Table B following this section.
         (c)   Noise mitigation.
            1.   Intent: To minimize noise intrusion into residential districts
which may be considered intrusive and incompatible with the peaceful enjoyment
of adjacent residents, by way of site planning and other means which will
effectively buffer noises and sound transmission.
            2.   It is understood that the minimization of sound intrusion is
most efficiently accomplished as close to the source as possible, and that
sound travels in a radial direction from the source, unlike light which
primarily travels in one direction.
            3.   Requirements: Noise shall be mitigated and use of property
shall be restricted tomitigate noise in compliance with the criteria, standards
and methods set forth in Table C following this section.
         (d)   Odor mitigation.
            1.   Intent: To minimize the atmospheric transmission of
commercially generated odors to nearby SF districts.
            2.   General: Whenever a site or use will contain a source of odor
emissions, consider the primary wind direction for this area (normally from the
southeast) in site planning. Design landscape and vegetative screens to channel
and re-direct wind flows through placement of the more compact and evergreen
plant types to take advantage of their mass and ability to modify wind
directions.
            3.   Requirements: Odor shall be mitigated and use of property
shall be restricted to mitigate odor in compliance with the criteria,
standards, and methods set forth in Table D following this section.

feet from the front lot line. If the principal building or structure is more
than 75 feet from the front lot line, an accessory building or structure may be
located in front or to the side of principal building or structure provided
that the accessory building or structure is more than 75 feet from the front
lot line. Unless the accessory building or structure is architecturally
compatible in construction materials, color, and design to the principal
building or structure, it must be screened by landscaping from being seen from
the front or side lot lines. The landscaping providing the screening must be
located within 25 feet from the front and side(s) of the accessory building or
structure.
      (11)   Detached garages may be located to the side or behind the
principal building or structure, except when the principal building or
structure is more than 75 feet from the front lot line. If the principal
building or structure is more than 75 feet from the front lot line, a detached
garage may be located in front of the principal building or structure. Detached
garages must be architecturally compatible in construction materials, color,
and design to the principal building or structure.
      (12)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a fence:
         (a)   Is permitted as an accessory use in any zoning district; and
must comply with the requirements of this section. In this section:
            (i)   An ornamental fence is a fence with an open design that has a
ratio of solid material to open space of not more than one to four; and
            (ii)   A solid fence is a fence other than an ornamental fence.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a solid fence
constructed along a property line may not exceed an average height of six feet
measured from the natural grade up or a maximum height of seven feet.
            (i)   If there is a change in grade of at least one foot measured
along any run of a solid fence along a property line, then the portion of the
fence where the grade change occurs may be constructed to a maximum height of
seven feet.
            (ii)   A solid fence along a property line may be constructed to a
maximum height of eight feet if each owner of property that adjoins a section
of the fence that exceeds a height of six feet files a written consent to the
construction of the fence with the building official; and,
            (iii)   There is a change in grade of at least two feet within 50
feet of the boundary between adjoining properties; or,
            (iv)   A structure, including a telephone junction box, exists that
is reasonably likely to enable a child to climb over a six foot fence and gain
access to a hazardous situation, including a swimming pool.
         (c)   A solid fence may be constructed to a maximum of eight feet in
height if the fence is located on or within the building setback lines.
         (d)   A solid fence may be constructed to a height of eight feet if
the fence is located between a residential use and:
            (i)   Property zoned as a commercial; or,
            (ii)   Property used for a commercial or industrial use; or,
            (iii)   An alley that separates residential uses.
         (e)   Except as provided in §
150.106(E)(c), a fence shall be constructed in accordance with this division.
            (i)   This division does not apply to a fence that was constructed
on or before or;
            (ii)   Is more than six feet in height and located on a property
with a non-residential use;
            (iii)   When more than 50% of the total linear distance of an
existing fence is replaced, the entire fence must comply with this division.
         (f)   A fence may not include:
            (i)   Spiked pickets, spiked bars, or other spiked decorative
elements above the top horizontal backer rail;
            (ii)   Vertical pickets above the top horizontal backer rail if the
vertical pickets are separated by more than two inches and less than nine
inches;
            (iii)   Razor-like wire or;
            (iv)   Barbed wire.
         (g)   A fence that creates a substantial risk of entrapment or
impalement is prohibited.
         (h)   A chain link fence shall use knuckle selvage.
         (i)   A fence used as a swimming pool barrier shall comply with the
adopted building code for pools and spas.
   (B)   Accessory buildings or structures may be used in conjunction with,
support of, or storage for a home occupation by special use permit.
   (C)   Any changes to an accessory use or structure (e.g., placement, angle,
size, etc.) not included within the plan submitted in support of the permit
application on which the accessory use or structure permit was granted must
have the written approval of the city prior to the change being constructed or
performed.
   (D)   For property zoned to be included in a single family residential or
PUD District and used only as a single family residential use, the rainwater
harvesting systems described in this division (D) shall constitute accessory
structures, but shall not (to the extent of the maximum size or capacity
provided in this division (D)) be subject to the following regulations: (i) the
limitations and restrictions set forth in divisions (A) (7), (8), and (10) of
this section; or (ii) the limitation on the maximum number of buildings and the
maximum combined floor areas of accessory structures set forth in §
150.134. By way of clarifying example, up to three accessory buildings and up
to a cumulative 1,500 square feet of accessory structures that comply with all
applicable provisions of this Code may be allowed notwithstanding the fact that
one or more of the rainwater harvesting systems described in this division (up
to the maximum size or capacity provided) are located on the affected property.
In addition, a rainwater harvesting system described in divisions (D)(1) and
(2) may be located in a side yard setback, provided that it is not located in a
utility or drainage easement; and rainwater harvesting systems described in
division (D)(1), (2), and (3) need not be architecturally compatible with the
primary structure nor screened from view.

§ 150.108 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND AND STRUCTURES.
   Any use of land or structures lawfully existing on the effective date of
this Code, or an amendment hereto, that is not permitted in the district in
which the use is located may be continued, subject to the following conditions:
   (A)   No nonconforming use of land shall be extended to occupy a greater
area of land than was occupied at the earlier of the effective date of either
adoption or amendment of this Code or predecessor ordinances incorporated in
this Code, which adoption or amendment caused the use of land to be out of
compliance with land use regulations.
   (B)   No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
earlier of the effective date of either adoption or amendment of this Code or
predecessor ordinances incorporated in this Code, which adoption or amendment
caused the use of land to be out of compliance with land use regulations.
   (C)   When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a period of more
than 90 consecutive days, it shall be deemed to be abandoned and subsequent use
of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Code for the
district in which the land is located.
   (D)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Code in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed (except to repair damage up to an extent of 50% of the
replacement cost of the structure, or as ordered by the Building Official as
set forth in §
150.109), moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (E)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the non conforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
   (F)   When a nonconforming use of land, a structure, or structure and
premises in combination, is discontinued for three consecutive months, except
for repairs covered by an approved building permit, not exceeding six months,
it shall be deemed to be abandoned and the land, structure, or structure and
premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (G)   Where nonconforming status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non
conforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this division is
defined as damage to an extent of more than 50% of the replacement cost at time
of destruction.
   (H)   The City Council, after notice and hearing, may require that a
nonconforming use be screened from view of the street or surrounding property,
or may require the elimination of any nuisance factor caused by a nonconforming
use.
§ 150.109 NON-COMPLYING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Any structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this Code, or
any amendment hereto, that is designed for a use permitted in the district
where the structure is located but which does not comply with one or more of
the “dimensional regulations” of this Code, such as limitations on area, lot
coverage, height and location on lot, shall be designated a non-complying
structure. This section is intended to provide rights on the conditions
provided herein only with regard to such dimensional regulations.
   (B)   No such non-complying structure may be enlarged or altered except as
allowed in the following divisions (C) and (D).
   (C)   Single family residential property.
      (1)   If a structure on property zoned and used as single family
residential property is partly complying and partly non-complying, the
complying portion of the structure may be repaired, rebuilt, remodeled or
altered in compliance with applicable regulations in any way as long as that
portion of the structure continues to meet all applicable dimensional
regulations in place at that time.
      (2)   The non-complying portion of a structure on single family
residential property that is partly non-complying, or a structure on single
family residential property that is entirely non-complying, may only be
repaired, rebuilt, remodeled or altered so long as (i) the repairs, rebuilding,
remodeling or alteration is done in the original footprint of the structure and
(ii) the repairs, rebuilding, remodeling or alteration meet all applicable
regulations except dimensional regulations and location of the structure on the
site.
   (D)   Structures on property zoned and used for any purposes other than
single family residential.
      (1)   Status of structures. If any portion of a structure on property
zoned and used for any purpose other than single family residential is non-
complying, the entire building is deemed to be a non-complying structure. If
the non-complying portion of the structure is permanently removed and the land
is restored to an undeveloped state, the remaining structure will be deemed a
complying structure.
      (2)   Damaged structures. This division applies to non-complying
structures that are (i) located on property zoned and used for any purpose
other than single family residential; and (ii) damaged by any means other than
a purposeful destruction or demolition by the owner. Should more than 50% of
the structure be destroyed, no reconstruction may occur except in full
compliance with all then current applicable law. Should less than 50% of the
structure be destroyed, reconstruction on the original footprint may be
permitted, provided the owner complies with all applicable dimensional
regulations in place at the time the structure is repaired or reconstructed. In
the event of a repair or reconstruction pursuant to this division, the
structure repaired or reconstructed in compliance with this section shall be
deemed a non-complying structure.
      (3)   All other structures. Undamaged non-complying structures located on
property zoned and used for any purpose other than single family residential
must be maintained in good condition but may not be altered or enlarged.
   (E)   The Building Official may order an unsafe non-complying structure to
be restored to a safe condition in compliance with all applicable regulations
of this Code. Any such order is subject to the provisions of this section
regulating the repair or reconstruction of partially or wholly damaged or
destroyed noncomplying structures. A building inspector that requires or
attempts to require any modifications not required by applicable Codes and
regulations shall forfeit the right to do business in Sunset Valley for 12
months.

CO, CONDITIONAL OVERLAY COMBINING DISTRICT
§ 150.205 CO, CONDITIONAL OVERLAY COMBINING DISTRICT INTENT.
   To provide flexible and adaptable use or site development regulations by
requiring standards tailored to individual properties in addition to and more
stringent than the base district to which it is attached, to insure
compatibility among competing or potentially incompatible uses, to ease the
transition from one base district to another, to address land uses or sites
with special requirements, and to guide development in unusual situations or
unique circumstances.
§ 150.206 CONDITIONAL OVERLAY COMBINING DISTRICT.
   (A)   Application. Property may be zoned as a CO Combining District in
accordance with the provisions of this Code. When an applicant applies for
zoning or rezoning using the CO Combining District, any notice required by this
Code shall include a description of the restrictions proposed by the applicant
and a statement that additional conditions may be imposed by the City Council
and that additional notice shall be provided if the City Council proposes to
require fewer conditions than proposed by the applicant or to zone or rezone
the property into the requested base district without the requested CO
Combining District.
   (B)   Use and site development regulations in the Conditional Overlay
Combining District. The CO Combining District modifies and restricts the use
and site development regulations otherwise authorized in the base district. All
requirements of a CO Combining District are in addition to and supplement all
other applicable requirements of this Code. Restrictions which may be imposed
by the CO Combining District shall be limited to the following:
      (1)   Prohibiting permitted and special uses and accessory uses otherwise
authorized in the base district, or making a permitted use a special use;
      (2)   Decreasing the number or average density of dwelling units which
may be constructed on the property;
      (3)   Increasing minimum lot size or minimum lot width requirements;
      (4)   Decreasing the maximum floor to area ratio permitted;
      (5)   Decreasing the maximum height permitted;
      (6)   Increasing the minimum yard and setback requirements;
      (7)   Decreasing the maximum building or impervious coverage permitted;
      (8)   Restricting access to abutting and nearby roadways, including
specific design features intended to ameliorate potentially adverse traffic
impacts;
      (9)   Providing for architectural and design features to enhance
compatibility with the residential character of the city; or
      (10)   Any other specific site development regulations required or
authorized by city ordinance or Code provision.
   (C)   Method of adoption. Conditions imposed by the CO Combining District
shall be included in the ordinance zoning or rezoning the property as a CO
Combining District. All property included in a CO Combining District shall be
identified on the Official Zoning Map by adding the letters "CO" to the base
district symbol. The ordinance zoning or rezoning property as a CO Combining
District shall specifically state the modifications imposed pursuant to this
Code. The restrictions shall be considered a part of the zoning provisions of
this Land Development Code. A violation of the restrictions shall be a
violation of the zoning provisions of this Code. The restrictions shall
continue in full force and effect until modified by City Council by amendment
to the ordinance zoning or rezoning the property as a CO Combining District.
   (D)   CO zoning of property subject to public restrictive covenants. For
purposes of this section, a "public restrictive covenant" is a covenant which
(i) names the city as its beneficiary, (ii) restricts use or development of the
property, and (iii) was recorded as a condition of approval of zoning or
rezoning by the City Council. The owner of any property subject to a public
restrictive covenant may request CO Combining District zoning of the property,
provided it pays an application fee for zoning. The City Council may initiate
CO Combining District zoning for any property subject to a public restrictive
covenant notwithstanding a request from the owner of the property. Restrictions
imposed under an ordinance granting a CO Combining District shall be identical
to restrictions in the public restrictive covenants. An ordinance zoning
property as a CO Combining District that includes all restrictions imposed by
public restrictive covenant(s) constitutes the consent of the City Council to
terminate the public restrictive covenant(s) on the property.
   (E)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses are determined by the base district
except as limited or further restricted by the CO conditional overlay.
   (F)   Special uses. Special uses are determined by the base district except
as limited or further restricted by the CO conditional overlay.
   (G)   Site requirements. Site requirements are determined by the base
district except as limited or further restricted by the CO conditional overlay.
   (H)   Supplementary requirements. Supplementary requirements are determined
by the base district except as limited or further restricted by the CO
conditional overlay.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 150.235 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OF SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONED LAND.
   (A)   Purpose. Planned Unit Development (PUD) is intended to encourage
innovative subdivision or site plan design and promote superior development. It
is suitable for the comprehensive development of large tracts of vacant or
substantially vacant land. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is
intended for tracts for which a standard zoning classification may be
inappropriate. Special circumstances that may warrant a PUD zoning
classification include the following:
      (1)   Areas with environmental constraints which may require special
design considerations for the preservation of environmental features not
adequately protected under current ordinances; and
      (2)   Areas of special concern to existing or proposed residential
neighborhoods where standard zoning may not adequately address concerns of land
use intensity, buffering and screening, open spaces, tree preservation, cluster
development, infill areas, undesirable activities or design features, access
and transportation impacts, landscaping, lighting, signage, noise, air quality,
protection of water resources, type of construction, type of building
materials, allowable uses, design concept, architectural diversity,
maintenance, height of improvements, building mass, square footage of
residential units, setbacks, recreational amenities, covered parking, view
preservation, historical preservation, public safety and welfare, or any other
features for which special site conditions or other considerations may warrant
innovative or custom design.
   (B)   Permitted uses. PUD may be utilized for any type of land use permitted
in single family residential zoning districts within the city, provided all
uses are compatible with adjacent uses and the Comprehensive Plan.
   (C)   Standards and criteria. When considering a PUD, the unique nature of
each proposal for a PUD may require, under proper circumstance, the departure
from certain codes and ordinances. The adoption of an ordinance establishing a
PUD District shall constitute authority for such flexible planning to the
extent that the PUD, as approved, departs from City Codes and ordinances.
However, each PUD must comply with the following criteria.
      (1)   Goals and objectives. Before approving a PUD, the City Council
shall determine that it meets all of the following goals and objectives:
         (a)   The development in the proposed PUD is equal to or superior to
development that would occur under the standard ordinance requirements;
         (b)   The proposed PUD shall be in harmony with the general purposes,
goals, objectives, and standards of the Comprehensive Plan;
         (c)   The proposed PUD shall not have an adverse effect upon adjacent
property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking,
utilities or any other matters affecting the public health, safety and general
welfare;
         (d)   The proposed PUD shall be adequately served by essential public
facilities and services including streets, parking, drainage, water, wastewater
facilities and other necessary utilities; and
         (e)   The proposed PUD shall be constructed, arranged and maintained
so as not to dominate, by scale and massing of structures, the immediate
neighboring properties or interfere with their development or use in accordance
with any existing zoning district.
      (2)   Size. Creation of a PUD is only justified for development of tracts
30 acres or greater in size. There is no maximum size for a PUD. However, a PUD
must consist of a parcel or group of parcels that form a single contiguous land
unit. For this purpose, an ownership separated solely by the width of a public
or utility right-of-way will be considered contiguous.
      (3)   Height and street requirements.
         (a)   Height. The height limitation for structures within the PUD
shall be approved as part of the development plan to assure compatibility with
adjacent developments and other portions of the PUD. Height may not exceed the
maximum height allowance for similar proposed uses in Single Family Residential
Zoning Districts within the city.
         (b)   Street. All pavement widths and curve radii, for public streets,
shall be designed to assure adequate access by fire and emergency vehicles.
      (4)   General provisions.
         (a)   Developments within a PUD must comply with all other applicable
ordinances not specifically waived by this section.
         (b)   The proposed PUD shall not waive any basic health or safety
standards.
      (5)   Density.
         (a)   Maximum density. The maximum density shall be as specified in
the PUD land development ordinance approved by the City Council, but shall be
no greater than one and one-half times the density allowed without PUD zoning
based on gross site acreage.
         (b)   Minimum lot sizes. Minimum lot sizes as required by the
subdivision and zoning ordinances may be waived, provided that:
            1.   The overall density of the PUD shall not exceed one and one-
half times the density permitted without a PUD designation;
            2.   The PUD provides for adequate buffers to assure compatibility
with adjacent developments inside and outside of the PUD; and
            3.   The PUD preserves natural features on the site to the extent
reasonably feasible.
         (c)   Density transfers and bonuses. Density transfers and bonuses may
be granted within a PUD, which would result in a variety of densities for
specific parcels within the PUD while maintaining the overall permitted density
of the entire PUD.
      (6)   Impervious cover standards. The maximum impervious cover for the
entire property within the PUD must conform to the impervious cover limitations
for each of the water quality zones for that property. PUDs are not required to
conform to any per lot requirements regarding impervious cover.
      (7)   Setback requirements. The proposed PUD may deviate from setback
requirements in the zoning ordinance.
      (8)   Street and alley sizes. The proposed PUD may contain streets and
alleys that deviate from the minimum street and alley size required by the
Sunset Valley Code or ordinances.
      (9)   Location. Creation of a PUD is only justified for large tracts of
land with street frontage along Ernest Robles Way or Highway 290.
   (D)   Designation of a PUD District.
      (1)   The designation of a PUD District shall be achieved though
amendment to the zoning ordinance.
      (2)   The applicant for PUD approval shall submit a development plan and
supporting documents shall form part of the ordinances and be attached as
exhibits thereto.
      (3)   Prior to formal consideration of a plan for a PUD, the Planning and
Zoning Commission and the City Council shall hold public hearings at which
interested parties or citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard in the
same manner as required for a rezoning application.
      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may take action to:
         (a)   Recommend approval of the development plan as submitted;
         (b)   Recommend approval of the plan contingent on changes suggested
by the Commission; or
         (c)   Recommend disapproval of the plan.
      (5)   The City Council may take action to:
         (a)   Approve the development plan as submitted;
         (b)   Amend and approve the plan as amended; or
         (c)   Disapprove the plan.
   (E)   Development plan.
      (1)   The development plan shall include both plans and written documents
for the entire PUD area and shall specifically include the following as a
minimum:
         (a)   The location and gross acreage of each density area including
the dwelling intensity of any residential areas or the lot sizes and locations
of any other uses within the PUD;
         (b)   A plan and written documentation of the locations and types of
open spaces in the PUD, including their intended uses, finished landscaping,
public access, and restrictions on development and access. This information
shall include details concerning access to and through open spaces,
restrictions or conditions on any development within each type of open space,
and responsibilities for maintenance of landscape and access and improvements
within open spaces;
         (c)   The location of the 25-year and 100-year floodplains and all
public streets;
         (d)   The conceptual location and acreage of streets and common open
space;
         (e)   The location, development, landscaping and maintenance criteria
of all buffer areas, which shall include at a minimum the area within 100 feet
inside the perimeter of the parcel, except for tracts fronting on Ernest Robles
Way shall include a buffer area with an overall average in width of at least
125 feet, provided the width of the buffer shall never be less than 100 feet
from Ernest Robles Way. Landscaped buffer areas may include naturally vegetated
or undisturbed areas;
         (f)   The development controls, such as deed restrictions and federal
wildlife restrictions, which will be applied to assure compatibility of the
proposed development with adjacent existing development and zoning districts;
         (g)   The assurance of maintenance and continued protection of the
PUD, including any of the common open space. This includes, but it is not
necessarily limited to, restrictive covenants, home owners’ association
agreements, maintenance agreements, deeds and agreements establishing easements
and rights-of-way;
         (h)   The public dedications and physical improvements which will be
undertaken to assure compatibility with adjacent land uses and the assurance
that the development will not require any excessive expenditures by the city
for road or utility improvements;
         (i)   A plan for the location of all public utilities;
         (j)   Drainage, water quality protection and flood control plans; and
         (k)   A plan showing the land uses, names of property owners, and
density of adjacent to development within 200 feet of the boundary of the PUD.
         (l)   A plan and elevation drawings showing building facades and
exterior details, fences, and landscaping and buffering, as will be seen from
the vantage points of public street rights-of-way abutting the PUD. Included
with such plans and elevations there shall be written documents that will
assure adherence to and compliance with such plans and elevation details. The
purpose of this provision is to provide assurance that the PUD will complement
and enhance, not degrade, the visual quality of the land and buildings in the
surrounding area.
      (2)   All plans shall be submitted as multiple copies, for review by each
Planning and Zoning Commission member, each City Council member, and
appropriate city staff. Plans shall adequately illustrate all of the required
information at a scale no finer that one inch equals 100 feet and a sheet size
no larger than 30 inches by 40 inches.
      (3)   Plans shall be submitted for review by the city staff at least 45
calendar days in advance of the first public hearing of the Planning and Zoning
Commission for this amendment.
      (4)   Detailed site plans, showing details in excess of those required on
the PUD Development Plan, may be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission
or the City Council as part of a PUD approval.
   (F)   Changes to a development plan.
      (1)   Minor changes. Minor alterations to the development plan required
by engineering or other circumstances that do not substantially change the
concept of the PUD may be approved administratively by the Deputy City
Administrator. Changes that reduce the intensity of the land use are minor
changes.
      (2)   Major changes. Major changes such as increased density shall be
submitted following the same procedure required in the original PUD
application.
   (G)   Platting. Platting will be determined by the proposed development
plan. The development plan must be approved prior to or simultaneously with the
approval of any plat.
   (H)   Procedures.
      (1)   Pre-application conference. Prior to filing an application for PUD
approval, the prospective applicant may request a pre-application conference
with the Deputy City Administrator and other city officials as deemed to be
appropriate. At the conference, the applicant shall present the general outline
of the PUD proposal, evidenced schematically by sketch plans. If the applicant
so requests, city staff shall, within ten working days, furnish the applicant
with written comments regarding the conference, including any appropriate
recommendations, to inform and assist the applicant in preparation of the
development plan.
      (2)   Zoning requirements. All zoning procedures, including fee payment,
shall be in accordance with this subchapter.
      (3)   Additional fees.
         (a)   Additional fees incurred by the city for review of the
development plan by city staff and consultants shall be reimbursed to the city
by the applicant in accordance with the city’s fee ordinance.
         (b)   Recording a PUD. The PUD ordinance approving the PUD shall be
recorded in the official deed records of Travis County. The recording costs
shall be paid by the applicant.

§ 150.268 FISCAL SECURITY REQUESTED.
   (A)   All plans and actual construction of required improvements shall be
inspected by a registered professional engineer retained by the city. No plans
or completed construction shall be considered for approval or acceptance by the
City Council without certification from said engineer that such plans and
calculations and such construction is complete and that they are in accordance
with specifications and standards contained or referenced herein, and/or with
plans previously approved for the subject subdivision. The engineer shall make
frequent field inspections during the construction period and arrange for
testing in accordance with accepted civil engineering practice. The engineer
shall submit periodic progress reports to the City Council during the
construction period. The final responsibility for the adequacy and
acceptability of all construction shall rest with the subdivider.
   (B)   Maintenance of improvements. The subdivider shall maintain such
improvements in good condition and in a manner acceptable to the City's
Engineer and without cost to the city for a period of two years after
acceptance of completed construction. Upon completion of construction and final
acceptance, the subdivider shall either deposit money in escrow or file with
the City Council a letter of credit or other such guarantee acceptable to the
City Council, executed by a bank or a surety company holding a license to do
business in the State of Texas, and acceptable to the City Council, in an
amount equal to 10% of the construction costs of the improvements required, and
approved by the city. Such money or surety shall be irrevocable for two years
from the date of acceptance of completed construction. Such surety shall
guarantee that, in the event of failure of the subdivider to maintain such
improvement as provided above, the subdivider's credit shall be encumbered so
as to cause the improvements to be repaired or restored without cost to the
city. Such money in escrow or bond shall be approved as to form and legality by
the City Attorney.
   (C)   Construction guarantee. The subdivider shall file the security and the
maintenance guarantee if all construction is not completed prior to requesting
final plat approval. The security shall be either money in escrow or a letter
of credit, irrevocable for a period of two years from the date of approval of
the final plat, in escrow or in a form approved by the City Attorney, in the
amount equal to the total estimated cost of constructing and installing all the
improvements required by this subchapter. Such letter of credit shall guarantee
that, in the event of failure of the subdivider to make such improvements,
within two years from the date of approval of the final plat, the subdivider's
credit shall be encumbered so as to cause the improvements to be constructed
and installed without cost to the city.
   (D)   Construction inspection. The City's Engineer shall inspect such
improvements while in progress and upon completion of construction shall notify
the subdivider, the City Council, and the attorney for the city in writing as
to his acceptance or rejection of the construction. He shall reject such
construction if it fails to comply with the standards and specifications
contained or referred to herein. If he rejects such construction, the attorney
for the city shall, on direction of the City Council, proceed to enforce the
guarantees provided in this chapter.
   (E)   Extensions. Where good cause exists, the City Council may extend the
period of time for completion under division (C) of this section for an
additional period of time not to exceed six months if the subdivider has not
completed the required site improvements or completed such improvements in
compliance with this subchapter. No such extension shall be granted unless
security and maintenance guarantees as required herein have been provided by
the subdivider covering the extended period of time.
   (F)   Release of escrow. Security and/or maintenance guarantees shall not be
released by the city until all the requirements for approval and acceptance of
improvements have been met. Money in escrow may be drawn from time to time in
relation to the percent of construction completed. Completion of construction
phases shall be approved by the City's Engineer and submitted to the City
Council for approval and release of funds. If it becomes apparent that the
subdivider is not going to complete the construction of any or all of the
required improvements in accordance with the previously approved plans and Code
requirements, or provide the necessary maintenance within the stipulated two-
year period or any extension thereof granted under division (E) of this
section, the city's engineer shall so inform the City Council in writing and
the City Council shall take necessary action against the guarantees and
security posted by the subdivider to complete such construction or maintenance
at no cost to the city. The City Council may also file appropriate proceedings
in District Court against the subdivider and his/her security as set forth
above.
§ 150.269 VARIANCES.
   (A)   All requests for variances must be submitted in writing to the City
Council. The City Council may authorize a variance from these regulations when,
in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In
making the findings herein required, the City Council shall take into account
the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of land in
the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed
subdivision, and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic conditions
and upon the public health, safety, convenience, and the welfare in the
vicinity. No variance shall be recommended unless the City Council finds:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this
chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land;
      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the applicant;
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area;
      (4)   That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of
preventing the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accordance with
the provision of this Code; and
      (5)   That the variance request is of such a minor nature that the spirit
and intent of this Code is not to be violated.
   (B)   Such findings of the City Council together with the specific facts
upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official
minutes of the City Council meeting at which such variance is recommended.
Variances may be recommended only when in harmony with the general purposes and
intent of this chapter so that the public health, safety, and welfare may be
secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardships to the subdivider,
standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship.
   (C)   No variance of the lot dimensional requirements shall be granted by
the City Council except after a public hearing wherein notice is given to
owners of real property within 500 feet of the boundaries of the subject
property.
   (D)   Where such conditions are found, the variance permitted shall be the
minimum departure from the terms of this subchapter necessary to avoid such
deprivation of privileges enjoyed by such other property to facilitate a
reasonable use, and which will not create significant probabilities of harmful
environmental consequences. The City Council may not grant a variance if it
would provide the applicant with any special privileges not enjoyed by other
similarly situated property with the similarly timed development, or if based
on a special or unique condition which was created as a result of the method by
which a person voluntarily subdivides land after the effective date of this
subchapter.
   (E)   Any application for a variance shall be accompanied by the fees set by
the City Council by ordinance or resolution.
§ 150.270 AUTHORITY OF THE CITY COUNCIL.
   The City Council is hereby authorized and directed to promulgate rules,
regulations, fees, standards and specifications for the construction,

to accept any offered dedications. Approval of the plat shall not be deemed
acceptance of such dedications until such time as the city has appropriated
same by entry, use, or maintenance.
         (h)   The certification statement to be signed by the Mayor upon
approval of the City Council that the final plat conforms to all requirements
of the subdivision regulations and other relevant regulations of the City of
Sunset Valley, Texas.
         (i)   A certification by the surveyor responsible for surveying the
subdivision area, attesting to its accuracy;
         (j)   The certification of the engineer responsible for the
preparation of the final plat and supporting data, attesting to its

   (B)   Processing of final plat.
      (1)   General. A final plat shall not be filed for recording with the
County Clerk until the City Council has approved the final plat and the
accompanying construction plans and cost estimates. Processing for final plat
approval shall parallel that described in §
150.281(F) for processing preliminary plats. Within 30 days after the complete
application for final plat approval is formally filed, the city shall approve
or disapprove such plat. If the City Council disapproves a proposed final plat,
it shall reference, in writing, any and all deficiencies of the proposed final
plat which were cause for disapproval. The subdivider shall be allowed to
submit a revised final plat which resolves the deficiencies on or before 180
days after the disapproval of the proposed final plat. The City Council shall
approve or disapprove the revised final plat within 30 days after the complete
revised final plat is formally filed. If the subdivider fails to file a revised
final plat on or before 180 days after the disapproval of the proposed final
plat, the application for review shall be conclusively presumed to have been
withdrawn by the applicant.
      (2)   If desired by the subdivider and approved by the Council, the final
plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he
proposes to record and develop. However, such portion shall conform to all the
requirements of this Code.
      (3)   As soon as practical after the subdivider is notified of the
approval of the preliminary plat, his engineer shall submit to the City Council
at an official meeting the final plat of the subdivision or portion thereof.
      (4)   (a)   1.   Once formal application for final plat approval has been
made, any substantial changes to the form or content of any final plat
submissions shall be deemed to constitute a new submission, superceding and
replacing any prior filing of a final plat or application for final plat
approval governing the same tract.
            2   Substantial changes to a final plat that have been requested in
writing by the city, a checking entity or the City Council do not create a new
submission within the meaning of the foregoing division.
         (b)   Hearing dates, deadlines or filing fees applicable to earlier
final plat applications or submissions do not apply to any new submission or
application made pursuant to §
150.282(B)(4)(a). A new filing fee is required for each new submission. New
deadlines and hearing schedules shall be established for each new submission or
application.
      (5)   No final plat will be considered unless a preliminary plat has been
submitted and approved. However, if an approved plat has been duly recorded and
the subdivider wishes to increase the size of the lots by combining two or more
lots or by combining one lot with a portion of the adjacent lot in such manner
that no portion of a lot remains smaller than the original lots, no preliminary
plat will be necessary. Major changes from the development proposed on the
preliminary plat may necessitate filing and approval of an amended preliminary
plat.
      (6)   A final plat of an approved preliminary plat or a portion thereof
shall be submitted to the City Council within six months of the date of
approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise, the approval of the City Council
shall become null and void, unless an extension of time is applied for and
granted by the City Council.
      (7)   If no development has occurred which would affect the proposed
plat, after six months of effective acceptance, the City Council may, upon the
application of the subdivider, extend the acceptance for one additional six-
month period. After review by the City Council, further modification may be
required by the City Council at that time of review. No additional filing fee
shall be required if modifications are requested by the City Council.
      (8)   City Council approval or disapproval of final plat. The City
Council shall disapprove the proposed final plat unless;
         (a)   The plat complies with the provisions of this chapter; and
         (b)   The uses proposed for the property being subdivided are
consistent with its zoning.
      (9)   Disapproval of the final plat shall indicate refusal to accept any
offered dedications. If the final plat is disapproved, the City Council shall
inform the subdivider in writing of the reasons for disapproval.
      (10)   Approval of the plat shall not be deemed acceptance of such
dedications until such time as the city has appropriated same by entry, use, or
maintenance and by the approval of the constructed improvements therein.
Approval of the final plat, plans, and specifications required herein shall not
prevent the City Council or the entity responsible for checking such documents
from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans and
specifications and in the construction of the associated improvements.
      (11)   When the final plat is filed with the City Council for approval,
it shall be accompanied by all relevant fees as set forth in the fee schedules
adopted by ordinance or resolution. Filing fees are non-refundable.
      (12)   Recording of plat.
         (a)   A final plat shall not be filed for recording with the County
Clerk until the City Council has approved the final plat and the accompanying
construction plans, cost estimates and security and maintenance guarantees as
hereinafter required, and certificates have been received stating that all
taxes on the land being subdivided have been paid to the current year.
         (b)   After the final plat has been finally approved and the
subdivider has constructed all the required improvements and such improvements
have been approved and accepted by the city and a maintenance guarantee filed
as hereinafter provided; or after the final plat has been finally approved and
the subdivider has filed the security and maintenance guarantees as hereinafter
provided, the secretary for the city shall cause the final plat to be recorded
with the County Clerk within two weeks after consent for filing has been
received from the subdivider. The City Council shall also cause the check or
checks from the recordation fee or fees deposited at the time the final plat
was filed for approval to be delivered with the final plat to the County Clerk.
         (c)   No plat shall be filed for record without the written consent of
the subdivider. If the subdivider fails to give such written consent within 30
days of the date of the final approval of the plat, the City Council may at any
time thereafter cancel such approval.
§ 150.283 STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   No preliminary or final plat shall be approved by the City Council, and no
completed improvements shall be accepted by the City Council unless they
conform to the following standards and specifications.
   (A)   Conformity with a comprehensive plan. The subdivision shall conform to
any comprehensive plans, codes and ordinances of the city.
   (B)   Provision for future subdivisions. If a tract is subdivided into
parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to
allow the opening of future streets.
   (C)   Reserve strips prohibited. There shall be no reserve strips
controlling access to land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to public use.
§ 150.284 VACATION OF PLAT OR SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   General. Any plat or replat may be vacated or resubdivided or
corrected by the owner of the land, provided that the Council approves the
action and the owner complies with applicable state law. No plat shall be
allowed to be resubdivided until the original plat has been vacated.
   (B)   Plat vacation. If no lots in the subdivision have been sold or
conveyed by any other means to another owner, the owner of the subdivision
shall be allowed to vacate said plat by submitting a written instrument to and
approved by the City Attorney and the County Clerk, and recording the same with
the County Clerk. In cases where lots in the subdivision have been sold or
otherwise conveyed to the owner, the plat shall only be allowed to be vacated
upon the application of all the owners of lots in said subdivision and with the
approval, as provided above, of the City Attorney and County Clerk.
   (C)   Plat correction. Plat corrections may be allowed by the City Attorney
without complying with the procedure for vacation and resubdivisions as
provided above. However, the correcting documents must be approved by the City
Council and City Attorney and recorded by the County Clerk.
   (D)   Fees. Any application for plat vacation or resubdivision or correction
shall be accompanied by fees set by the City Council in the fee schedules
adopted by ordinance or resolution set forth in this Code.
§ 150.285 BURDEN OF PROOF.
   Any subdivider applying for a subdivision plat approval under this chapter
must establish that the plat complies with the requirements of this chapter.
PLATTING REQUIREMENTS

no credit for any land used for roadway or utility easements.
   (B)   In lieu of land within the property to be subdivided, the city shall
have the option to arrange for the acquisition and dedication of other land of
similar value if mutually agreeable to the subdivider and the city, or to
accept a deposit of money in a trust account in the amount equal to the market
value, as reflected on an appraisal prepared within 12 months of making
application to subdivide the property, of 3% of the total property to be
subdivided. These funds are to be used by the city for acquisition of park
land, recreational facilities or conservation in another area. No area or
facility shall be dedicated for such public purposes unless approved and
accepted by the Council.
§ 150.305 WASTEWATER SYSTEM INSTALLATION.
   (A)   All subdivisions shall be provided with city approved sewage treatment
and disposal systems. Pursuant to the Wholesale Water Service Agreement
executed on or about October 2, 1987 and amended on February 27, 2003 between
the City of Sunset Valley and the City of Austin and pursuant to the Wholesale
Wastewater Service Agreement executed on or about December 27, 1985 and amended
on February 27, 2003 between the City of Sunset Valley and the City of Austin,
all public wastewater facilities must be constructed according to City of
Austin water and wastewater utility standards and specifications in effect on
the effective date of this chapter. The City of Austin's water and wastewater
utility standards and specifications shall include those regulations contained
in following chapters of the City of Austin Code of Ordinances: Chapter 15-
2 Drainage Facility; Chapter 15-3 Fire Hydrant Regulation; Chapter 15-7 Use of
City-Owned Infrastructure; Chapter 15-9 Utility Service Regulations; Chapter

§ 150.307 DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The interpretation of the requirements set forth in this section shall
be made by the City's Engineer or designate, unless specified otherwise by the
City Council. The subdivider shall be responsible for the conveyance of all
storm drainage flowing through or abutting the subject property, including
drainage directed to the property by prior development as well as that
naturally flowing by reason of topography.
   (B)   Where new drainage improvements are required along the boundary of a
subdivision, the owner proposing development shall be responsible for designing
and constructing all the required improvements at or before the time of
development, including the dedication of all necessary rights-of-way or
easements necessary to accommodate the improvements. Where the subdivider
proposes to subdivide only a portion of the property, only the drainage
improvements for the portion being subdivided shall be required to be
installed, except as drainage improvements outside the portion being subdivided
are deemed necessary by the city for proper drainage of the portion being
subdivided.
   (C)   The responsibility of the subdivider shall extend to the provision of
adequate off-site drainage facilities and improvements to accommodate the full
effects of the development of said property.
   (D)   When the subdivider certifies by affidavit that a bona fide attempt to
acquire property rights to meet off-site drainage requirements was not
successful, the city may assist at its discretion in the acquisition of
necessary property rights to provide for the construction of off-site drainage
improvements. In such cases, the subdivider shall make adequate guarantees that
he will stand the full cost of acquiring said property rights and constructing
the off-site improvements and facilities.
   (E)   Unless otherwise specified herein, the design of all storm drainage
facilities shall at least meet the requirements of the City of Austin Drainage
Criteria Manual.
   (F)   Computation of runoff shall be based on a fully developed drainage
area, or watershed, in accordance with City of Austin drainage criteria. The
drainage system shall be designed to convey the theoretical 25-year storm as
predicted in the Drainage Criteria Manual. The design shall further provide for
system overflows from larger storms up to the intensity of the 100-year storm
without increasing the risk of flood damages to development.
      (1)   Natural drainage channels shall be preserved whenever possible.
Open surface drainage through grass-lined swales shall be preferred over the
use of enclosed sewers, streets and street right-of-way as the central drainage
network. The provisions of §
150.063 shall apply in regard to street drainage. Drainage into or across
sinkholes, faults and other areas of rapid groundwater recharge shall be
avoided whenever practicable.
      (2)   The rate of runoff after construction shall not exceed the site's
runoff rate prior to construction. Rate of runoff shall be computed on a 25-
year storm peak flow using the City of Austin Drainage Criteria Manual as of
the effective date of this Code.
      (3)   In the event that stormwater drainage systems and/or culverts are
necessary, such systems shall be designed to mitigate their impact on water
quality through the use of approved control strategies to control sediment and
dissipate energy and through the use of multiple smaller outlets whenever
practical and by locating discharges to maximize overland flow.
      (4)   Surface drainage channels shall be designed to reduce velocity,
minimize potential erosion and to maximize the bottom width to flow depth
ratio, in accordance with the following criteria:
         (a)   Channel cross-sections shall be trapezoidal in configuration.
         (b)   Side slopes of channels shall be no steeper than four horizontal
to one vertical.
         (c)   For a six-month design storm assuming wet antecedent conditions,
channel bottom flow depth shall not exceed four inches and design flow velocity
shall be two and one-half feet per second.
         (d)   All constructed and altered drainage channels shall be
stabilized and vegetated immediately after final grading.
         (e)   The City Council may allow exceptions to the design flow
velocities or depths in the following situations in conformance with the
purpose of §
150.307(F)(3) hereof.
            1.   On lands with greater than 15% slope, or less than 2% slope;
provided that the design flow velocity shall never be greater than three feet
per second or design depth greater than six inches.
            2.   In limited transitional channel sections (such as culverts,
culvert entries and exits, drop sections, sharp bends, and water quality basin
entries).
   (G)   Public easements or rights-of-way shall include all drainage at least
to the limits of the 25-year flood as indicated on the floodplain maps or as
determined on the basis of the Drainage Criteria Manual. The minimum drainage
easement or right-of-way width shall be 25 feet. All drainage easements across
private property shall contain the necessary language to permit the required
unobstructed water flow, require maintenance of vegetation by the property
owner(s), and permit the necessary access by city officials for inspection and
repairs. All easements, 25 and 100-year floodplain boundaries and water quality
zones shall be clearly shown on drainage plans and the final plat.
   (H)   As a general rule, drainage carried in roadside channels shall be
minimized and off-roadway locations shall be used as the primary drainage
network whenever practicable.
   (I)   When roadside channels are required, they shall be contained within a
dedicated right-of-way or right-of-way easement. Channel side slopes shall be
no steeper than four to one, except for curves and transitions where slope
stabilization acceptable to the City's Engineer may be allowed. Roadways shall
be designed for fordable driveway approaches whenever practical. All driveways
shall be designed such that drainage flow from a 100-year storm shall not
exceed a depth of 12 inches on any portion of the driveway. Should driveway
culverts be required, the culvert design, capacity, and general location shall
be shown on the construction plans. Minimum driveway culvert diameter shall be
12 inches. In no case shall driveway approaches constitute a blockage of
roadway drainage.
   (J)   All drainage facilities located in the street rights-of-way shall be
maintained by the appropriate jurisdiction. All drainage facilities located on
private property shall be maintained by the property owner.
   (K)   Duly authorized inspectors of the city shall have the right of entry
on the land or premises where property owners are required to maintain drainage
facilities or detention facilities, at reasonable times, for the purpose of
inspection of writing that the property owner comply. This notice shall
describe the measures required to be taken. If, within three months of the
notice the maintenance required is not accomplished, the city shall either:
      (1)   Cause the necessary restoration to be accomplished and assess the
property owner for the city's actual cost; or
      (2)   Bring an action for mandatory injunction to require the property
owner to accomplish the necessary maintenance.
   (L)   The required maintenance by private landowners and the power of the
city shall be noted on the plat.
§ 150.308 WATER SYSTEM INSTALLATION.
   (A)   All subdivisions shall be provided with water supply and water
distribution systems approved by the City Council. Pursuant to the Wholesale
Water Service Agreement executed on or about October 2, 1987 and amended on
February 27, 2003 between the City of Sunset Valley and the City of Austin, all
public water facilities must be constructed according to City of Austin Water
and Wastewater Utility standards and specifications in effect on the effective
date of this chapter. The City of Austin's Water and wastewater utility

15-10 Wastewater Regulations; and Chapter 15-9, Article 1 Utility Service. All
public wastewater facilities must also be constructed according to the City of
Sunset Valley Master Water Line Plan in effect on the effective date of this
chapter. Connection with the Municipal Water Supply System shall be required.
Isolated lots may be served by a private well if permitted by the City Council.
In no event shall a water well be dug without a permit from the city.
   (B)   If the subdivision is not to be served immediately by the existing
system, the subdivider shall be required to make necessary improvements to the
system.
   (C)   Before the City Council may approve a final plat for a subdivision
located outside of or beyond the existing water supply system, the subdivider
shall furnish the City Council and the City's Engineer with statements from the
state Health Department that water satisfactory for human consumption may be
obtained from sources on the land.
   (D)   All subdivisions shall provide for, as a minimum, 130 gallons per
capita of additional ground storage or 55 gallons per capita of additional
elevated storage. The calculated storage volume for a residential subdivision
shall be based on three persons per single family living unit. In addition, as
a minimum, a firm pumping capacity of 500 gallons per minute, with 20 pounds
per square inch of residual pressure, shall be provided.
§ 150.309 REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL FACILITIES FOR SINGLE FAMILY
RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   For property to be subdivided into single family residential lots,
where at least one of such lots is less than five acres, the subdivision shall
be provided with adequate water quality control facilities that comply with the
requirements of the Watershed Development chapter of this Code. Those

subdivision regulations of this Code.
   (B)   The subdivider shall designate a reasonable number of water quality
control facilities, each of which of sufficient design to serve as much of the
area of the subdivision as is practical for each individual facility; the total
number of facilities shall, however, be sufficient to serve the entire
subdivision.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, such water quality
control facilities may be designed, at the subdivider's option, to cross lot
lines, provided that the facilities lie entirely within the subdivision; and
provided that the subdivider complies with all other applicable regulations and
standards in this Code regarding water quality control facilities; and provided
further that the facilities comply with any other applicable minimum setbacks
for structures, including but not limited to setbacks from streets, water
quality zones, adjacent property that is not part of the subdivision, and
critical environmental features.

such person arising from this chapter shall also inure to such person's
successors in interest, assigns, agents, employees, representatives, or any
person acting pursuant to the direction of any the foregoing, or under color of
the same.
   (D)   The city shall neither seel nor supply any water or sewage service nor
authorize natural gas or electricity service for use on: (i) improved property
either developed or improved without an approved watershed development permit
at a time when such permit was required by applicable law; or (ii) improved
property which is not in compliance with any standard or regulation applicable
to the property pursuant to approval of a watershed development permit for the
property.
   (E)   In behalf of the city, the City Attorney, shall when directed by the
City Council, institute appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction
to enforce the provisions of this chapter or the standards referred to herein
with respect to any violation thereof which occurs within the city, within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, or within any area subject to all or
a part of the provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not be
construed to prohibit the issuance of a permit for any parcel of land that
meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The parcel had a residential building and the building was in
existence and in use as a residence prior to the passage of Ordinance 920519 of
the City of Sunset Valley; and
      (2)   The last conveyance of the parcel prior to the passage of Ordinance
920519 was either by metes and bounds or by lot and block if within a
subdivision and said conveyance was filed of record with the property records
of Travis County, Texas prior to the passage of Ordinance 920519.
   (G)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to prohibit the
issuance of permits for repair or maintenance.
   (H)   Section
150.322 is subject to and limited by §
150.011.
§ 150.323 VARIANCES AND ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVALS.
   (A)   Except as provided in the provisions of this section authorizing
variances or administrative approvals in connection with single family
developments, the City Council may authorize a variance from these regulations
when, in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict
compliance. In making the findings herein required, Council shall take into
account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of
land in the vicinity, and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic
conditions and upon the public health, safety, convenience, and the welfare in
the vicinity. No variance shall be approved unless the City Council finds:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this
chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable and economic use of his
land;
      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the applicant;
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area;
      (4)   That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of
preventing the orderly development of other land in the area in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter; and
      (5)   That the proposal demonstrates water quality will be equal to or
better than would have resulted had development proceeded without the variance.
   (B)   Such findings described in division (A) together with the specific
facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the
official minutes of the City Council meeting at which such variance is
recommended. Variances may be recommended only when in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of this chapter so that the public health, safety, and
welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardships to a
person or developer standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue
hardship.
   (C)   The City Council may grant a variance, pursuant to division (A), from
the terms referring to the Development Free Zone within a proposed plan when
the strict compliance will result in an unreasonable and unwarranted taking or
an undue hardship. Where such conditions are found, the variance permitted
shall be the minimum departure from the terms of this chapter necessary to
avoid such deprivation of privileges enjoyed by such other property to
facilitate a reasonable use, and which will not create significant
probabilities of harmful environmental consequences. The City Council may not
grant a variance if it would provide the applicant with any special privileges
not enjoyed by other similarly situated property with the similarly timed
development.
   (D)   Any application for a variance shall be accompanied by the fees set by
the Council in the fee schedules adopted by ordinance or resolution.
   (E)   Section
150.323 is subject to and limited by §
150.011.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (G) of this section in connection
with administrative approval of certain incidental improvements, for a single
legal lot or two adjacent existing legal lots that are zoned and used or
proposed to be used for single family residential purposes, a variance,
administrative approval, or modified administrative approval is required, as
applicable, as provided in this division (F), to develop any portion of the lot
that lies within the Water Quality Transition Zone ("WQTZ") or Critical Water
Quality Zone ("CWQZ").
      (2)   In connection with any such variance, administrative approval, or
modified administrative approval, all development shall, to the greatest extent
practicable, be located first in the Uplands Zone, then in the WQTZ, and
lastly, in the CWQZ located on such legal lot (such zones being listed in order
from least protected to most protected). For purposes of this division (F), the
development in a less protected zone shall be deemed not to be practicable: (I)
where a restrictive covenant recorded before April 1, 2009 that is enforceable
by one or more third parties other than the city prohibits development in a
manner that precludes the location of a proposed additional development in the
less protected zone; (II) for a residential home constructed before April 1,
2009, the requirement of developing first in the least protected zone would
necessitate a new front entrance, or reconstruction of the front of such
residence; and (III) for a residential home constructed before April 1, 2009,
the requirement of developing first in the least protected zone would result in
the location in the front or side yard of a swimming pool, accessory structure
or other improvement typically located in the backyard of a residence.
         (a)   If so much of the legal lot lies within the WQTZ that applicable
regulations restricting development in the WQTZ would restrict the developer to
less impervious cover than otherwise would be permitted if the legal lot lay
wholly in the Uplands Zone, the developer may be granted administrative
approval, to be issued by the City Administrator or his/her designee, to
include impervious cover of up to 14% of the area in the WQTZ on the terms and
conditions provided in this division (F)(1):
            1.   The allowable improvement (not including the mitigation
measure required by division (F)(1)(e)) does not require the addition of any
fill;
            2.   The improvement is in compliance with all applicable
provisions of this Code, including but not limited to §§
150.030 through
150.252 and §§
150.360 through
150.384, and complies with other City Codes, rules and regulations;
            3.   The improvement does not impede surface water runoff or
drainage patterns and does not increase flooding on upstream or downstream
properties; and
            4.   The improvement is not used for the storage or processing of
hazardous materials or substances other than those normally associated with
household or residential use and only in small quantities (e.g., small
quantities of gasoline and oil used for the operation of landscape equipment).
            5.   One of the three mitigation measures described in §
150.323(J) as a rain garden, natural vegetative filter strip, or engineered
vegetative filter strip will be provided and maintained at all times to the
standard described or referred in §
150.323(J) to minimize degradation of water quality, and the owner of the legal
lot agrees, as a condition of administrative approval, to impose the
requirement on the owner of such legal lot to provide and maintain such
measures on the legal lot as a restrictive covenant, to run with the land, in
favor of the city, in a form approved by the City Attorney, and to be recorded
in the Official Records of Travis County, Texas;
            6.   The percentage of impervious cover on the legal lot as a whole
does not exceed 18%;
            7.   In the event that a transfer of development rights from the
affected legal lot has occurred, the amount of impervious cover so transferred
shall be deemed to be located on the affected legal lot in determining the
amount of impervious cover available, if any, with an administrative approval
pursuant to this division.
            8.   For the purpose of calculating whether the total maximum
impervious cover of 18% is reached, items identified as excluded in §
150.332(E) shall be treated as impervious cover includable in the resulting
total amount of impervious cover.
            9.   A minimum setback of at least 75 feet shall be maintained
between the critical water quality zone and developed, impervious, or pollutant
source areas, or areas of disturbed vegetation or soil in the water quality
transition zone. Within the aquifer recharge zone, a 100-foot minimum setback
shall also be preserved between developed, impervious, or pollutant source
areas, or areas with disturbed vegetation or soil in the water quality
transition zone and any identified recharge features.
         (b)   Subject to any rights pursuant to an administrative approval for
development in the WQTZ, if so much of the legal lot lies within either the
WQTZ or the Critical Water Quality Zone ("CWQZ") that the developer cannot
reasonably develop the lot without encroaching into the WQTZ or the CWQZ, or if
disallowing development in either the WQTZ or CWQZ located on the legal lot
would restrict the developer to less impervious cover than otherwise would be
permitted if the legal lot lay wholly in the Uplands Zone, and an
administrative approval for development in the WQTZ pursuant to this division
(F) is insufficient to allow a total of 18% impervious cover on the legal lot,
a variance may be approved for development of up to 18% impervious cover in
either the WQTZ or CWQZ on the terms and conditions provided in divisions (A)
through (D).
         (c)   For lots developed as part of a subdivision of land of ten or
more lots that are restricted, as a result of an allocation of development
rights among such lots, to less than 18% impervious cover, the provisions of
this division (F) shall apply to an administrative approval or modified
administrative approval regarding impervious cover on such lot, except that the
following shall apply: (i) the requirements of divisions (F)(1)(g) shall not
apply; (ii) the requirement of division (F)(1)(e) shall apply regardless
whether the lot is located wholly or partially in the Uplands Zone or where on
the lot the development is proposed; and (iii) the restriction to no more than
14% impervious cover in the WQTZ on the lot will apply, but an administrative
approval or modified administrative approval may be granted for up to a total
of 18% impervious cover to the extent that any impervious cover that exceeds
14% is located in the Uplands Zone on the lot.
         (d)   In the event that a restrictive covenant affecting a legal lot
provides for a limitation on impervious cover less than that allowed pursuant
to this division (F) that is enforceable by the city, the Mayor shall, at the
request of the affected legal lot owner, execute an instrument amending such
restriction in a manner that limits the amount of impervious cover on the
affected lot to the amount allowed pursuant to an administrative approval,
modified administrative approval, or variance granted pursuant to this division
(F). For convenience, any restrictive covenant required by the terms of this
division (F) in connection with an administrative approval or variance may be
combined in one instrument with an amendment of any then existing restrictions
regarding impervious cover. In the event that the term of any restrictive
covenant, whether or not enforceable by the city, that is applicable to a legal
lot provides for a limitation on impervious cover less than allowed pursuant to
this division (F) but provides for modification or termination in the event
that the city's regulations are altered to allow for increased impervious cover
on affected property, this division (F)(4) shall be effective to automatically
terminate or modify such restrictive covenant to the extent of development
permitted by this division (F) and as provided by the terms of such restrictive
covenant. In particular, this division (F)(4) shall apply as an action taken by
Council to allow the amount of impervious cover on any lot to exceed the amount
shown for such lot on Exhibit "A" as stated in Section 3.12 of the Declaration
of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Sunset Valley Meadows Subdivision
recorded in Document No. 1999032885 of the Official Public Records of Travis
County, Texas, provided that the total amount of impervious cover on any such
lot does not exceed 18%.
         (e)   A modified administrative approval may be given for development
to which division (F)(1) applies on the following basis: An applicant may
submit a request for such development with a proposal to provide another means
of mitigation not listed in §
150.323(J). Such application will be subject to City Council approval, which
approval may be given if: (i) the City Council determines that the alternative
means of mitigation provides water quality protection equal to or better than
the means listed in §
150.323(J); (ii) such alternative means does not, as determined by the City
Council, require excessive maintenance and/or is not more likely to be subject
to equipment malfunction or deterioration; (iii) such alternative means is not
unsightly and does not create excessive noise or other conditions that are
incompatible with surrounding residential uses, as determined by the City
Council; (iv) all conditions and obligations set forth in §
150.323(F)(1)(a) through §
150.323(H) are met; and (v) applicant agrees to comply with any other condition
imposed by the City Council in connection with such an approval.
   (G)   (1)   Water quality transition zone small structures. Subject to
divisions (G)(1)(a) through (G)(1)(d), below, the City Administrator or his/her
designee shall grant administrative approval of an application to construct,
operate, and maintain in the WQTZ on a legal lot zoned and used for single-
family residential purposes improvements described in §
150.332(E), provided the applicant demonstrates that the following conditions
are met:
         (b)   The improvement is in compliance with all applicable provisions
of this Code, including but not limited to §§
150.030 through
150.252 and §§
150.360 through
150.384, and complies with other city Codes, rules and regulations;
         (c)   The improvement does not impede surface water runoff or drainage
patterns and does not increase flooding on upstream or downstream properties;
and
         (d)   The improvement is not used for the storage or processing of
hazardous materials or substances other than those normally associated with
household or residential use and only in small quantities (e.g., small
quantities of gasoline and oil used for the operation of landscape equipment).
      (2)   In addition to the requirements of division (G)(1), an applicant
seeking to construct any structures or buildings described in §
150.332(F) other than those described in §
150.332(F) (1)[sidewalks],(2)[uncovered decks],(4)[swimming pools, hot tubs,
wading ponds, fountains, birdbaths, fish ponds] must, as a condition of the
approval, implement and maintain on the property on which the proposed
improvement will be located at least two of the Pollution Reduction Practices
described in division (I) of this §
150.323, which are more fully described in the CSV Pollution Reduction Manual.
The obligation to implement and maintain Pollution Reduction Practices shall be
specified in a duly recorded restrictive covenant affecting the property which
shall be enforceable by the city. Such obligation to implement and maintain
shall remain effective so long as such improvements remain on the property.
      (3)   An applicant may receive credit for any existing pollution
reduction practice maintained on the property for which an administrative
approval is requested unless: (i) the applicant has previously received credit
for the pollution reduction practice pursuant to this division or other
approval by the City Council; and (ii) the improvement, the structure or
building for which the previous approval was granted still exists on the
property.
      (4)   If the applicant objects to a determination on his or her request
for administrative approval under this division, he or she may appeal the
determination to the City Council by submitting a written notice of appeal
setting forth the bases on which the applicant believes the determination was
incorrect. Such written appeal must be addressed to the City Administrator and
submitted on or before 20 days after the date of the determination from which
an appeal is sought. The City Council may affirm, modify, or reverse the
determination based on the criteria set forth in this section.
      (5)   An applicant seeking an administrative approval for the
improvements described or referred in this division (G) is not required to
satisfy any other variance provisions of §
150.323.
   (H)   Pollution reduction measures. The residential pollution reduction
practices are described in detail in the CSV Pollution Reduction Manual as
amended and approved by the City Council, which Manual shall be applicable to
any pollution reduction practice required by this §
150.323. The following is a list of such pollution reduction practices:

§ 150.324 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   General. Except as expressly authorized in this section, no
development, as that term is defined in this Code, can occur or be undertaken
within the City of Sunset Valley or its extraterritorial jurisdiction unless a
watershed development permit has been issued in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Residential construction. For the construction of a single family
development that proposes residential lots of no less than five acres per lot
and is appropriately restricted to that residential density, a watershed
development permit is required, however, no water quality controls are
required, provided the owner and/or developer of the property complies with the
impervious cover requirements set forth in this chapter and with the building
and site development requirements imposed by this or other applicable
provisions of this Code and city ordinances.
   (C)   Capital improvement projects. For the construction of capital
improvement projects for roadways, a watershed development permit is required,
however, the impervious cover calculations addressed in this chapter do not
apply.
   (D)   Minor fill activities.
      (1)   No watershed development permit shall be required for minor fill
activities involving the deposit of no more than ten cubic yards of fill on
property within the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction, provided that no
part of such fill shall be or is to be deposited on land located within the
critical water quality zone, the water quality transition zone or a drainage
easement. If any part of such fill is to be deposited on any land so located, a
watershed development permit must be applied for and issued and the
requirements of this chapter must be complied with in full.
      (2)   If the city has reason to believe that more than ten cubic yards of
fill is being deposited within the critical water quality zone, water quality
transition zone or a drainage easement, without a permit therefore, the city
shall issue a stop work order to both the property owner and the person
depositing the fill. No additional fill shall be deposited or further work done
in connection with the project until either a development fill permit is
obtained pursuant to division (D)(3) of this section, or a watershed
development permit is obtained in accordance with and as required by the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Any developer, property owner or other person wishing to deposit
more than ten but fewer than 50 cubic yards of fill on a lot or legal lot that
is one acre or less within the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction shall
first secure a development minor fill permit. The application for the
development minor fill permit shall be on such form as may be provided by the
city, and shall be reviewed by the City Administrator or his/her designee, who
shall determine whether the proposed project qualifies as a minor fill
activity. Such determination shall be based upon the information contained in
the application and such other information as the city may reasonably require.
Due consideration shall be given to such factors as the use and proposed
location of the fill, the nature, number, location and frequency of prior
deposits of fill on the property, the location and topography of property on
which the fill is proposed to be deposited, and the impact of the deposit on
the environment and the public health, safety and welfare. If the proposed
project is found to qualify as a minor fill activity, a development minor fill
permit shall be issued, subject to such conditions as the city may reasonably
impose. No permit fees and no city inspections shall be required in connection
with the issuance of the permit.
      (4)   For lot or legal lot larger than one acre, a developer, property
owner or other person wishing to deposit more than ten but fewer than 50 cubic
yards of fill per acre included in such lot or legal lot within the city or its
extraterritorial jurisdiction shall first secure a development minor fill
permit. The application for the development minor fill permit shall be on such
form as may be provided by the city, and shall be reviewed by the City
Administrator or his/her designee, who shall determine whether the proposed
project qualifies as a minor fill activity. Such determination shall be based
upon the information contained in the application and such other information as
the city may reasonably require. Due consideration shall be given to such
factors as the use and proposed location of the fill, the nature, number,
location and frequency of prior deposits of fill on the property, the location
and topography of property on which the fill is proposed to be deposited, and
the impact of the deposit on the environment and the public health, safety and
welfare. If the proposed project is found to qualify as a minor fill activity,
a development minor fill permit shall be issued, subject to such conditions as
the city may reasonably impose. No permit fees and no city inspections shall be
required in connection with the issuance of the permit.
      (5)   If the City Administrator determines, in accordance with the
guidelines set forth in divisions (D)(3) or (4) of this section, that the
proposed project does not qualify as a minor fill activity, the permit
applicant shall be notified of such determination in writing, and advised that
he or she may not engage in or proceed with the proposed fill activity without
first complying with all provisions of this chapter relevant to the securing of
watershed development permits and the requirements for the issuance of said
permits.
      (6)   The applicant may appeal the determination of the City
Administrator that the proposed project does not qualify as a minor fill
activity by filing written notice of appeal with the City Secretary within ten
business days of receipt of the notice referred to in division (D)(5) of this
section. The City Council shall consider the appeal as soon as practicable, and
shall either affirm, modify or overrule the determination. The decision of the
City Council shall be based on the maximum volume of fill allowed pursuant to
this section, and the factors to be considered pursuant to divisions (D)(3) or
(4), as applicable.
      (7)   With respect to any minor fill proposed to be deposited pursuant to
this section, the applicant shall submit to the city the identity of the source
of any fill material to be deposited and the certification of the owner of such
fill that same does not contain any hazardous or toxic substances or materials.
   (E)   Signage. Signs or three-dimensional lettering, logos, designs or
symbols that contribute less than eight square feet of impervious cover and
that do not collect or divert significant amounts of rainfall or runoff or
contribute in any significant way to water pollution or degradation are wholly
exempt from the operation of this chapter.
   (F)   Mailboxes. Structures devoted entirely for use as mailboxes are wholly
exempt from the operation of this chapter provided the structure does not
significantly affect drainage or contribute in any significant way to water
pollution or degradation.
   (G)   Fences. Fences are wholly exempt from the operation of this chapter
provided the fence does not significantly affect drainage or contribute in any
significant way to water pollution or degradation.
   (H)   Pre-existing structures.
      (1)   Gardening and landscaping of lots containing pre-existing
structures are wholly exempt from the operation of this chapter so long as such
activities do not have significant impacts on drainage and do not contribute in
any significant way to water pollution or degradation.
      (2)   Remodeling, alteration, or repair of existing structures is not
subject to the operation of this chapter so long as such remodeling, alteration
or repair does not increase impervious cover and so long as such activities do
not have significant impacts on drainage and do not contribute in any
significant way to water pollution or degradation.
      (3)   Demolition activities are not subject to the operation of this
chapter so long as such demolition does not involve sinkholes or other critical
environmental features, have significant impacts on drainage and does not
contribute in any significant way to water pollution or degradation.
      (4)   The extension of water or wastewater lines to single family homes
is not subject to this chapter so long as such extensions do not extend through
creeks, sinkholes or other critical environmental features or do not contribute
in any significant way to water pollution or degradation.
   (I)   Sprinkler system. No watershed permit is required for the installation
or repair of residential irrigation or sprinkler systems so long as such
installation or repair does not have significant impacts on drainage and does
not contribute in any significant way to water pollution or degradation.
§ 150.325 SITE PLAN SUBMITTALS.
   (A)   General. Prior to issuance of a watershed development permit, the

deposited.
   (C)   Cash deposit. A cash deposit shall be tendered to the city prior to
the issuance of a permit for any fill activity subject to the provisions of
this section. The amount of the cash deposit shall be based upon the City
Engineer's estimate of the following:
      (1)   The cost of hiring a gatekeeper to monitor compliance with the
terms of the permit relevant to the source and quantity of the fill;
      (2)   The cost of removing the fill if same is not deposited in
accordance with the terms of the permit;
      (3)   The cost of grading and/or revegetating the fill site if same is
not done in accordance with the terms of the permit; and
      (4)   Reasonable administrative costs incurred by the city in connection
with the foregoing.
   (D)   Permit terms. Upon the applicant's tender of the cash deposit, and
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the City Council may issue the
watershed development permit. The permit shall specify the duties of the
gatekeeper, the location at which the fill shall be deposited, the quantity of
the fill that shall be deposited, the source of the fill to be deposited, how
the fill site is to be graded, how the fill site is to be revegetated, and the
dates by which such grading and revegetation must be completed. Unless
authorized by the City Council, all grading shall be completed within 30 days
of the deposit of the authorized fill, and revegetation of the fill site within
30 days thereafter.
   (E)   Inspections and notice to correct. The city shall have the right to
enter upon the property and inspect the fill site. If the city determines that
the terms of the permit are being or have been violated, the city shall issue a
written stop work order, and/or a written notice to correct the violation(s).
The notice to correct shall be served upon the owner and the contractor and
shall identify the violations and specify the corrective action to be taken and
the time within which same must be completed. The notice shall also advise that
if the corrective action is not completed as directed, the city will draw upon
the cash deposit and perform or cause to be performed the required corrective
action.
   (F)   Appeals. The owner and/or contractor may appeal the city's
determination that the terms of the permit have been violated by filing a
written notice of appeal with the City Secretary within ten business days of
receipt of the notice to correct. The City Council shall consider said appeal
as soon as practicable. If the City Council determines that any condition of
the permit has been violated, it may proceed to draw upon the cash deposit and
perform or cause to be performed the required corrective action.
   (G)   Draw on deposit. If no appeal is taken in accordance with and as
authorized by division (F), and the required corrective action is not completed
as and within the time directed, the city may draw upon the cash deposit and
perform or cause to be performed the required corrective action.
   (H)   Refund of deposit balance. Upon final inspection and the city's
determination that the terms of the permit have been satisfied, the city shall
refund the balance of the cash deposit that remains after deductions therefrom
have been made to pay the expenses of the gatekeeper, the costs incurred by the
city in connection with its performance of any required corrective action and
the city's reasonable administrative costs incurred in connection with the
foregoing.

         (c)   Impervious cover, water quality controls, and drainage shall be
designed to allow maximum infiltration of clean rainfall runoff. The applicant
shall provide an increased average annual infiltration equal to 125% of the
infiltration volume lost due to development within the transition zone. The
increase must be shown compared to the average annual infiltration volume
without the proposed water quality transition zone encroachment. Increased
infiltration can be achieved using retention/re-irrigation of stormwater
runoff, infiltration basins, disconnected impervious cover, and/or engineered
vegetative buffers. Infiltration estimates must be based either on soil data
for the site published by the Soil Conservation Service (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, 1974), or on field measurements of the infiltrative capacity of
the surface soil, using such devices as a ring infiltrometer. Subsurface
infiltration testing methods for septic systems are not acceptable.
         (d)   Water quality controls shall be designed to be at least 25% more
efficient at reducing the average annual pollutant load for total suspended
solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorous and total organic carbon or chemical
oxygen demand than water quality controls required for development in the
Upland Zone.
         (e)   Where development encroaches into the water quality transition
zone, associated turf and landscaped areas requiring fertilizer, pesticides,
herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides for maintenance shall be prohibited.
Disturbances of the natural vegetation and tree cover shall be prohibited
except within the building footprint and the surrounding construction
disturbance area. The surrounding construction disturbance area within the
water quality transition zone shall be limited to a maximum radius of 20 feet
from the building footprint, unless the developer can demonstrate that a
greater, specified radius is necessary and would not produce greater adverse
effects than a 20-foot radius.
         (f)   A variance under this division may be granted only if the
property to be developed in the water quality transition zone has not already
been used for transferring development intensity credits.
      (4)   The conditions of a variance permitted under this division shall be
imposed on the property as a restrictive covenant running with the land, in a
form approved by the City Attorney, and recorded in the real property records
of the Travis County, Texas once a final site plan is approved by the City
Council.

are met, a Certificate of Occupancy will be released by the accountable
official.
   (C)   Final acceptance of facilities by the city, or approval of
Certificates of Occupancy shall not be issued until a water quality control
inspection of the facility and certificate of compliance is completed by the
city.
§ 150.335 EROSION SEDIMENTATION CONTROL AND CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCING; DUST
CONTROL.
   (A)   Erosion and sedimentation controls in accordance with the
specifications established in the Environmental Criteria Manual, as amended,
are required for all construction and development, including without limitation
commercial, multi-family, single-family, and two-family construction, the
construction of all roads, utilities, parks, golf courses, water quality
controls, detention basins, and all other activities utilizing clearing,
trenching, grading or similar construction techniques.
   (B)   Projects shall not be considered complete until restoration has been
made, the approved permanent vegetation established and installation certified
for acceptance by the city after receipt of the engineer's concurrence letter.
   (C)   Significant changes to approved erosion control and construction
sequencing plans may be made in the field after two days written notice to the
permit holder if the city inspector deems the control or sequencing
inappropriate or inadequate, and has confirmed those findings with the city.
Minor changes which result in an upgrading of erosion controls or simply
reflect the progression of construction on a site may be accomplished in the
field without such written approval.
   (D)   Development shall require a temporary erosion and sedimentation
control plan and water quality plan certified by a registered professional
engineer and approved by the City Engineer which will control off-site
sedimentation during the construction of the project by temporary structural
controls, site management practices, or other approved methods until permanent
revegetation is certified complete. The temporary erosion control plan must be
phased to be effective at all stages of construction and must be adjusted,
maintained, and repaired as necessary. The water quality plan shall be approved
in conjunction with the site plan approval. In addition, a dust control plan
approved by the City Engineer shall be included with the other plans required
herein.
      (1)   At the time the developer submits a final site plan, the developer
also shall submit the erosion and sedimentation control, water quality, and
dust control plans.
         (a)   The plan must specify site layout, grading, and drainage
patterns, locations of all land disturbance, silt fences, spoils disposal
areas, delineation of limits of construction, construction staging areas,
construction entrances, temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation
controls, and temporary and permanent water quality controls.
         (b)   The plan must contain a discussion of project phasing and
measures for assuring that proper erosion protection is in place.
         (c)   The plan must contain measures to limit airborne particulates
and dust when dry and/or windy conditions create potential air quality
degradation.
      (2)   Prior to clearing activities at the site, all permanent water
capture-type controls must be excavated and drainage appurtenances constructed
such that these facilities will serve as temporary construction-phase
sedimentation traps prior to final finishing and revegetation of the structure.
      (3)   Silt control measures must be placed in the unfinished water
quality structure to assure that sediment does not flow unfiltered from the
unfinished facility.
      (4)   The contractor's representative responsible for compliance with
construction-phase sediment and erosion control rules must perform the
following activities:
         (a)   Attend the pre-construction meeting at the site to present
proposed temporary erosion control measures to the City Engineer and/or the
city's representative.
         (b)   Prior to any site clearing, conduct an inspection of all
temporary erosion control measures with the City Engineer and/or the city's
representative.
         (c)   During or immediately after al significant rainfall events,
visit the site to evaluate the performance of temporary erosion control
measures.
         (d)   Following each significant rainfall event, schedule a meeting
with the City Engineer or the City's Engineering representative to discuss the
performance, ongoing adequacy and required upgrades of the site's temporary
erosion control measures.
         (e)   During dry or windy conditions creating potential dust migration
off-site, must implement the dust suppression measures described in the
erosion/sedimentation plan.
      (5)   All drainage from potentially disturbed areas must drain through a
properly installed silt fence prior to exiting the site. Silt fences must be
constructed in strict compliance with design specification detailed in the City
of Austin's Environmental Criteria Manual. Silt fence construction must use
proper excavation and anchoring depth and minimal disturbance and complete
compaction of disturbed areas adjacent to the silt fence, as described in the
City of Austin Environmental Criteria Manual. Silt Fences must be properly
secured to steel posts and woven wire supports such that there are no openings
at the junctions of silt fence material. The contractor shall only use new or
completely intact silt fence material. No worn, torn, or punctured silt fence
material is permitted. When accumulated silt behind a silt fence exceeds six
inches in depth, it must be removed and properly disposed of. After completion
of the project and certification of complete stabilization of site vegetation,
the silt fence may be removed; however, the disturbed ground must be thoroughly
compacted such that there is no loose soil along the former path of the silt
fence.
   (E)   The following general standards shall apply to all development:
      (1)   Clearing of existing vegetation is prohibited unless the city
determines the clearing is pursuant to and in accordance with a released site
plan or a released subdivision construction plan;
      (2)   Limited clearing of existing vegetation or other specified
development activities necessary for surveying or geological testing is
authorized before release of a site plan or subdivision construction plans to
the minimum extent necessary to survey or conduct geological tests. Areas
cleared for surveying or testing purposes shall not exceed a width of 15 feet.
No tree with a diameter greater than four inches shall be removed in connection
with surveying or testing.
      (3)   Clearing of existing vegetation on land used for an agricultural
use is prohibited if an application for approvals required to develop that land
for other than an agricultural use is pending or such an approval has been
granted, including without limitation an application for approval of a
preliminary subdivision plan, a final subdivision plat, a site plan, or zoning
as a district where the agricultural use is not permitted. The city may waive
this prohibition if the applicant can show that the clearing has a bona fide
agricultural purpose and is unrelated to the proposed development or sale of
the land for nonagricultural uses.
      (4)   The location for clearing for temporary storage of spoils or
construction equipment shall be shown on the released site plan. Any such
location shall be in accordance with the City of Austin Environmental Criteria
Manual, as amended. Topsoil shall be protected against erosion during and after
the site grading operations. Where practical, the existing vegetation shall be
left in place.
      (5)   The length of time between rough-cutting and final surfacing of a
street shall not exceed 12 months. If an applicant does not meet this deadline,
the city shall provide written notice to the applicant and to the record owner
of the subject property that the city may complete the street or revegetate the
disturbed area at the applicant's expense unless the work is completed no later
than 60 days after the date of notice.
      (6)   Roadway clearing width shall not exceed the width of the dedicated
right-of-way.
      (7)   Vegetation within the critical water quality zone and the water
quality transition zone may not be disturbed except for purposes consistent
with development activity permitted by §§
150.328 and
150.329.
      (8)   All constructed and altered drainage channels shall be stabilized
and vegetated immediately after final grading.
      (9)   The city shall submit a copy of the erosion and sedimentation
control measures to the Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer Conservation District
for review and comment.

the time of sale of the property on which such water quality control is
located, a new permit must be obtained, and in connection therewith, the city
shall perform an inspection for compliance with applicable design and
performance standards. It shall be the responsibility of both the selling and
purchasing owner to obtain such renewal permit and to accommodate such
inspection by the city.
   (E)   Fiscal security.
      (1)   Except with regard to water quality controls permitted pursuant to
§
150.323(F) and §
150.323(G), fiscal security shall be required for development in the city and
the ETJ to ensure that the water quality controls required are functioning
properly. Fiscal security shall be based on an estimate prepared by the
developers engineer and reviewed and approved by the city. The estimate shall
include, but is not limited to, the cost to construct the temporary and
permanent water quality control facilities for the particular site development.
      (2)   The fiscal security shall be returned to the applicant no earlier
than one year after completion of the development, and only upon the receipt of
a certified engineering concurrence letter verifying that the controls are
constructed in conformance with the approved design as verified after
inspection by the city.
      (3)   In the event the annual inspection required under this chapter
reveals that the water quality controls are not being properly maintained or
repaired, fiscal security shall be required in connection with the issuance of
the next annual inspection and renewal permit. The amount of the fiscal
security shall be 10% of the amount which had been required for the initial
construction of the water quality control facilities. This fiscal security
shall be retained by the city for a minimum of two years to a maximum of five
years; however, the city retains the right to extend or reimpose the
requirement for fiscal security at any time inspections reveal that the water
quality controls are not being maintained or repaired.
§ 150.337 ADDITIONAL POLLUTION REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   All development shall include the following additional pollution reduction
techniques:
   (A)   No untreated run-off arising from development shall be allowed to flow
over critical environmental features that are recharge features.
   (B)   No untreated run-off arising from development, shall be allowed in
defined channels containing recharge features provided that for single family
residential lots adjacent to transition zones, untreated run-off may be
discharged through the transition zone provided that the transition zone meets
the criteria in the City of Austin Environmental Criteria Manual, as amended,
for vegetative filter strips.
   (C)   Developments must provide detention for the two-year storm, unless it
is determined by the city that the development is a participant in a regional
stormwater detention facility, or centralized detention facility, or control of
the two-year storm will result in identifiable adverse flooding as determined
by a Registered Professional Engineer and confirmed by the City Engineer.
   (D)   Commercial development shall also include two of the following four
pollution reduction measures:
      (1)   Xeriscape with a fertilizer reduction element and an integrated

aquifers and other ground water and surface water supplies. Plugging, filling,
or sealing any significant recharge feature, as that term is defined in this
Code, is prohibited.
   (B)   There shall be minimal adverse impact upon critical areas, such as
streams, slopes greater than 15%, highly erodible soils and mature stands of
native vegetation.
   (C)   No proposed structure shall impair creek flow or cause lateral back up
of water.
   (D)   Pesticide and fertilizer management plan.
      (1)   A pesticide and fertilizer management plan shall be submitted
providing information regarding proper use, storage, and disposal of pesticides
and fertilizers. The plan shall indicate likely pesticides and fertilizers to
be used. The plan shall include two lists of pesticides and fertilizers: (1)
those which, due to their chemical characteristics, potentially contribute
significantly to water quality degradation; and (2) those which, due to the
chemical characteristics, potentially would result in minimal water quality
degradation.
      (2)   Landscaped areas should use limited amounts of fertilizer. Nitrogen
within the fertilizer should be slow-release formulations: composted organic
mulches, urea formaldehyde (UF), methylene urea, isobutylidene diuriea (IBDU),
and sulfur coated urea (Pitt, 1994). The mass of nitrogen applied to each area
per year should not exceed the estimated nitrogen utilization rate of the
vegetation. The following table provides a guide of typical nitrogen
utilization rates for the Texas Hill Country:

cover as necessary to prevent erosion. Juniper trees must be trimmed and native
grasses established beneath. Supplemental vegetation should be selected to be
drought resistant, sturdy under short periods of inundation and shall require
minimum fertilization for vigorous growth.
   (G)   Fertilizer application to the vegetative filter at a rate greater than
75 pounds/acre per year must be preceded by an assessment of the nitrogen
requirements of the vegetation and the measurement of nitrogen concentration in
the soil.
   (H)   The maximum slope of the vegetative filter must be 5% or less.
Alternatively, a demonstration, sealed by a registered professional engineer,
may be presented to show that flow velocities through the filter during the 10-
year design storm will not be erosive.
   (I)   Flow velocities through the vegetative filter shall not exceed one
foot/second for the one-year design storm.
   (J)   The average annual hydraulic load to the vegetative filter shall not
exceed 20 inches per year.
   (K)   Vegetative filters shall not be used for construction-phase erosion
and sedimentation controls.
   (L)   Vegetative filter strips for commercial or multifamily development
will be operated and maintained either by the City of Sunset Valley or by the
owner. If maintained by the owner, an annual operating permit to ensure the
continued effectiveness of the flow spreader and that there is no erosion or
gullying, and the presence of adequate vegetation to prevent erosion shall be
required.
   (M)   Vegetative filter strips for residential development will be
maintained by the City of Sunset Valley.
   (N)   The vegetative filter strips shall be inspected visually by the owner
at least once each year and following every rainfall event of eight inches or
more within 24 hours. Inspection will include, at a minimum:
      (1)   Examination of vegetation for indications of distress.
      (2)   Examination of the soil and topography for indications of erosion
or flow channeling.
      (3)   Examination of the entire length of all diversion berms and level
spreaders.
   (O)   Any changes in vegetation which reduce the effectiveness of the
vegetative buffers strip will be repaired. If repeated channeling and erosion
of the vegetative filter occur, it may be necessary to supplement or replace
the filter with structural controls.
§ 150.341 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a water quality control
facility subject to the requirements of this subchapter without first obtaining
an annual operating permit.
   (B)   Any person to whom a water quality control facility operating permit
has been granted commits a violation of this subchapter if such person fails to
observe and perform any term or condition stated in the permit, approved
maintenance plan, or in any other document submitted in order to secure the
permit.
   (C)   The owner of any land or water quality control facility where anything
in violation of this subchapter is constructed or operated, and any architect,
builder, contractor, agent, laboratory, independent inspector, or any other
person employed in connection therewith commits a violation of this Division if
he or she knowingly aids, assists, or contributes to the Commission of such
violation.
§ 150.342 ADOPTING DRAINAGE CRITERIA MANUAL.
   (A)   The Drainage Criteria Manual, First Edition, January, 1977, and
amendments thereto, as published by the City of Austin, Engineering Department
is hereby designated and adopted as the drainage criteria and policy of and for
the City of Sunset Valley and within all areas subject to the City of Sunset
Valley's Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction.
   (B)   The following listed portions of the Drainage Criteria Manual are
deleted and shall not become a part of the drainage criteria and policy of the
City of Sunset Valley: Paragraph IX, p. 3 is deleted, and the Appendix shall be
and hereby is deleted.
   (C)   Whenever the standards and specifications of this chapter conflict
with another provision of the Land Development Code or city ordinance, the most
stringent or restrictive provision shall govern.
§ 150.343 DRAINAGE; GENERAL.
   (A)   The interpretation of the requirements set forth in this chapter shall
be made by the City's Engineer or designate, unless specified otherwise by the
Council. The developer shall be responsible for the conveyance of all storm
drainage flowing through or abutting the subject property, including drainage
directed to the property by prior development as well as that naturally flowing
by reason of topography.
   (B)   Where new drainage improvements are required along the boundary of a
site, the owner proposing development shall be responsible for designing and
constructing all the required improvements at or before the time of
development, including the dedication of all necessary rights-of-way or
easements necessary to accommodate the improvements. Where the developer
proposes to develop only a portion of the property, only the drainage
improvements for the portion being developed shall be required to be installed,
except as drainage improvements outside the portion being developed are deemed
necessary by the city for proper drainage of the portion being developed.
§ 150.344 OVERLAND FLOW.
   (A)   Drainage patterns should be designed to prevent erosion, maintain
infiltration and recharge of local seeps and springs, and attenuate the harm of
contaminants collected and transported by stormwater. Overland sheet flow and
natural drainage features and patterns shall be maintained to the greatest
extent reasonably possible and the dispersion of run-off back to sheet flow
shall be the primary objective of drainage design where possible, depending on
volumes and velocities of run-off for the development, as opposed to
concentrating flows in storm sewers and drainage ditches.
   (B)   Construction of enclosed storm sewers and impervious channel linings
are permitted only when the city on the basis of competent engineering
evidence, concludes that such storm sewers or impervious linings are protective
of water quality.
   (C)   If storm sewers are deemed necessary as specified above, the applicant
shall design the drainage system to mitigate its harmful impact on water
quality by using structural devices or other methods to prevent erosion and
dissipate discharges from outlets wherever practicable, and by loading
discharges to maximize overland flow through buffer zones or grass line swales.
§ 150.345 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   The responsibility of the developer shall extend to the provision of
adequate off-site drainage facilities and improvements to accommodate the full
effects of the development of said property.
   (B)   When the developer certifies by affidavit that a bona fide attempt to
acquire property rights to meet off-site drainage requirements was not
successful, the city may assist at its discretion in the acquisition of
necessary property rights to provide for the construction of off-site drainage
improvements. In such cases, the developer shall make adequate guarantees that
he will stand the full cost of acquiring said property rights and constructing
the off-site improvements and facilities.
§ 150.346 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Unless otherwise specified herein, the design of all storm drainage
facilities shall at least meet the requirements of the City of Austin Drainage
Criteria Manual.
   (B)   Computation of runoff shall be based on a fully developed drainage
area, or watershed, in accordance with the minimum provisions of the City of
Austin drainage criteria. The drainage system shall be designed to convey the
theoretical two, ten and 25-year storm as predicted in the Drainage Criteria
Manual, as amended. The design shall further provide for system overflows from
larger storms up to the intensity of the 100-year storm without increasing the
risk of flood damages to development.
      (1)   Critical environmental features shall have a standard setback of
150 feet around said feature. An administrative variance may be granted by the
City Engineer for a 50 feet setback on the downstream side only of said
feature.
      (2)   The rate of runoff after construction shall not exceed the site's
runoff rate prior to construction. Rate of runoff shall be computed on a two,
ten and 25-year storm peak flow using the City of Austin Drainage Criteria
Manual, as amended.
      (3)   Surface drainage channels shall be designed to reduce velocity,
minimize potential erosion and to maximize the bottom width to flow depth
ratio, in accordance with the following criteria:
         (a)   Channel cross-sections shall be trapezoidal in configuration.
         (b)   Side slopes of channels shall be no steeper than four horizontal
to one vertical.
         (c)   For a six-month design storm assuming wet antecedent conditions,
channel bottom flow depth shall not exceed four inches and design flow velocity
shall be two and one-half feet per second.
         (d)   All constructed and altered drainage channels shall be
stabilized and vegetated immediately after final grading.
         (e)   The City Council may allow exceptions to the design flow
velocities or depths in the following situations:
            1.   On lands with greater than 15% slope, or less than 2% slope;
provided that the design flow velocity shall never be greater than three feet
per second or design depth greater than six inches.
            2.   In limited transitional channel sections (such as culverts,
culvert entries and exits, drop sections, sharp bends, and water quality
control entries).
§ 150.347 EASEMENTS.
   Public drainage easements shall include all drainage at least to the limits
of the 25-year flood as indicated on the floodplain maps or as determined on
the basis of the Drainage Criteria Manual, as amended. All drainage easements
across private property shall contain the necessary language to permit the
required unobstructed water flow, require maintenance of vegetation by the
property owner(s), and permit the necessary access by city officials for
inspection and repairs. The minimum drainage easement width shall be 25 feet.
All easements, 25 and 100-year floodplain boundaries and water quality zones
shall be clearly shown on drainage plans and the site plan.
§ 150.348 ROADWAY DRAINAGE.
   (A)   As a general rule, drainage carried in roadside channels shall be
minimized and off-roadway locations shall be used as the primary drainage
network whenever practicable.
   (B)   When roadside channels are required, they shall be contained within a
dedicated right-of-way or right-of-way easement. Channel sides lopes shall be
no steeper than four to one, except for curves and transitions where slope
stabilization acceptable to the City's Engineer may be allowed. Roadways shall
be designed for fordable driveway approaches whenever practical. All driveways
shall be designed such that drainage flow from a 100-year storm shall not
exceed a depth of 12 inches on any portion of the driveway. Should driveway
culverts be required, the culvert design, capacity, and general location shall
be shown on the construction plans. Minimum driveway culvert diameter shall be
12 inches. In no case shall driveway approaches constitute a blockage of
roadway drainage.
§ 150.349 MAINTENANCE AND COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   All drainage facilities located in the street rights-of-way shall be
maintained by the appropriate jurisdiction. All drainage facilities located on
private property shall be maintained by the property owner.
   (B)   Duly authorized inspectors of the city shall have the right of entry
on the land or premises where property owners are required to maintain drainage
facilities or detention facilities, at reasonable times, for the purpose of
inspection of the maintenance required. Where noncompliance is found, the city
shall request in writing that the property owner comply. This notice shall
describe the measures required to be taken. If, within three months of the
notice the maintenance required is not accomplished, the city shall either:
      (1)   Cause the necessary restoration to be accomplished and assess the
property owner for the city's actual cost; or
      (2)   Bring an action for mandatory injunction to require the property
owner to accomplish the necessary maintenance.
   (C)   The required maintenance by private landowners and the power of the
city shall be noted on the plat.
FLOOD LOSS CONTROL
§ 150.360 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Tex. Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
These regulations are adopted pursuant thereto.
§ 150.361 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Sunset Valley are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
§ 150.362 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
§ 150.363 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
§ 150.364 LANDS TO WHICH THIS SUBCHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City of Sunset Valley.
§ 150.365 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report, entitled "Flood
Insurance Study for Travis County and Incorporated areas, Volumes 1 thru 6,"
dated September 26, 2008 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood
Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto, and those
areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency through the National Flood Insurance Program as shown in the Flood
Insurance Rate Map 48453C0210E, panel 210 and 255 of 410 dated, September 26,
2008 and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of this Code and are subject to the floodplain management regulations
of the City of Sunset Valley as set forth herein.
§ 150.366 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the
provisions of this chapter. This system will consist of a city-wide application
review procedure and the issuance of permits only for those developments
located within the identified flood hazard areas. Developments located outside
of identified flood hazard areas will be issued a development permit exemption
certificate stating that the proposed development is not located within an
identified flood hazard area and that the construction standards required in
this chapter are not applicable to the proposed development.
§ 150.367 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land located in the incorporated areas of the city shall
hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
§ 150.368 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
§ 150.369 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of
the city; and (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
§ 150.370 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
§ 150.371 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT APPLICATION FORM, DEVELOPMENT PERMIT FORM AND
DEVELOPMENT PERMIT EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE.
   The development permit application form, development permit form and
development permit exemption certificate form which shall be used to implement
this chapter are available at the city's municipal office. The City of Sunset
Valley may promulgate any additional forms as may be necessary for the
implementation of this chapter.
§ 150.372 ESTABLISHMENT OF FEES.
   The Sunset Valley City Council shall establish fees commensurate with the
service rendered by the city.
§ 150.373 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Mayor, City Administrator or his/her designee is hereby appointed the
Floodplain Administrator (Administrator) to administer and implement the
provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National

relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   (H)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with §
150.375, the Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
   (I)   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Administrator
must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A and AE on the
city's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
§ 150.375 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   A completed development permit application form must be submitted to
the City Administrator prior to the start of construction of development within
the corporate limits of the City of Sunset Valley, Texas.
   (B)   The Administrator will review all applications to determine whether
such construction or other development is proposed within the identified flood
hazard areas of the City of Sunset Valley. If a proposed development is not
within the identified flood hazard area, then the Administrator will issue a
development permit exemption certificate to the applicant.
   (C)   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
Administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited
to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and
elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures,
and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;

conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
      (7)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
      (8)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (9)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (10)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area.
§ 150.376 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Appeal Board which consists of the Sunset Valley City Council
shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements
of this chapter.
   (B)   The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal such decision to the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   The Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an
appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre of less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in this chapter have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter.
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon, (i) showing a good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws, Code provisions, or ordinances.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (J)   Variances may be issued by the City of Sunset Valley for new
construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary
for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria
outlined in §
150.375(D)(l) through (D)(10) are met; and (ii) the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
§ 150.377 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   (A)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   (B)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
§ 150.378 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has
been provided as set forth in (i) §
150.365, (ii) §
150.374(H), or (iii) §
150.379(C), the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the Administrator that the standard of this division is satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this division. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosure. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exist of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on
the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and (ii) be fully licensed and
ready for highway use; and (iii) meet the permit requirements of §
150.375(A), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured
homes" in this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
§ 150.379 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with findings, purposes
and methods of reducing flood losses upon which these regulations are based.
   (B)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions shall meet
development permit requirements of §
150.366; §
150.375; and §§
150.377 through
150.384.
   (C)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development which are greater than 50 lots or five acres,
whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to §
150.365 or §
150.374(H).
   (D)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (E)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage.
§ 150.380 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
150.365 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the city's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the city's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or,
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Administrator that the standards of this section are
satisfied.
   (D)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
§ 150.381 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
150.365 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
150.377 through
150.384.
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit
encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes
all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.
§ 150.382 NUISANCE.
   Any construction, modification, improvement, land cut or fill violation of
this chapter is hereby declared a public nuisance and the continuation of such
activity may be enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 150.383 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this subchapter is held to be
invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said
holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this
chapter.
§ 150.384 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.

adjacent bays. Sidewalks shall be installed between parking bays.
      (2)   All parking lots for ten or more cars shall have sidewalks or
planter strips to lead pedestrians from their cars to shopping or business
areas. Sidewalks or planter strips shall be placed in front of all parking
spaces.
      (3)   If sidewalks are provided, they shall be a minimum of five and one-
half feet wide or meet minimum ADA requirements, whichever are more
restrictive, and allow for auto overhang of 15 inches on each side. Parking bay
sidewalks shall contain attractive bench or seating/resting areas (minimum of
one bench or seating/resting area per 50 parking spaces). Bench or seating/
resting areas shall contain shade trees or other vegetation meeting the city's
landscape code. Bench/seating areas shall contain litter receptacles and shall
be continuously maintained by the owner.
      (4)   In lieu of parking lot sidewalks, planter strips shall be provided
as informal pedestrian walkways and to shade and screen cars. Planter strips
shall be a minimum of five and one-half feet wide, shall be planted with trees
meeting the landscape provisions of this Code, and shall contain bench or
seating/resting areas (minimum of one bench or seating/resting area per 50
parking spaces).
      (5)   Parking lot sidewalks and planter strips shall be designed to
integrate with lighting requirements to provide for pedestrian safety and
visual appearance.
   (F)   Paving and drainage. The following basic standards shall be observed:
      (1)   In all districts, parking and loading facilities shall be surfaced

any residential use. See Table B in §
150.105.
   (I)   Fencing and screening. A parking facility in any nonresidential
district which adjoins or abuts property in a residential district shall have a
wall or fence or vegetation screen not less than four feet in height located
for the length of the common boundary.
   (J)   Noise. Areas used for primary circulation, for frequent idling of
vehicle engines, or for loading activities shall be designed and located to
minimize impacts on adjoining properties, including provisions for screening or
sound baffling. See Table C following in §
150.105.
   (K)   Maintenance. All parking and loading facilities shall be maintained to
assure desirability and usefulness of the facility. Such facilities shall be
maintained free of refuse, debris, or other accumulated matter and shall at all
times be available for the off-street parking or loading use for which they are
required or intended.
   (L)   Adjustments. For a use or a site subject to site plan review or a
special use permit, the minimum requirements of this section may be adjusted in
their application, provided such change is determined by the Council to provide
improved design, usability, attractiveness, and protection to adjoining uses,
in a manner equal to or greater than the specific requirements of this section.
   (M)   Striping. Crosswalk lines shall be painted on the surface of the
parking lot from handicapped parking areas to the building. Crosswalk lines
shall be solid white lines, marking both edges of the crosswalk. They shall be
not less than six inches in width and should be spaced less than six feet, but
more than four feet apart. For added visibility, the area of the crosswalk may
be marked with white diagonal lines at a forty-five degree angle or with white
longitudinal lines at a ninety degree angle to the line of the crosswalk. These
lines should be approximately 12 inches to 24 inches wide and spaced 12 inches
to 24 inches apart. Warning signs should be installed to notify drivers that
the crosswalk areas may be used by persons with disabilities.
FIRE LANES
§ 150.605 PURPOSE.
   The requirement that fire lanes be established in certain parking areas and
the enforcement of restrictions on parking in such fire lanes established in
this chapter are designed to ensure adequate access to commercial, office,
multi-family, and other high density use facilities by fire-fighting and other
emergency vehicles.
§ 150.606 BASIC REGULATIONS.
   (A)   A fire lane shall be provided in any off-street parking facility
constructed or reconstructed subsequent to the effective date of this chapter,
when such parking facility is required by the zoning provisions of this Code to
include five or more parking spaces.
   (B)   Whenever a person or entity applies for a building or construction
permit for construction that will necessitate the provision of a fire lane
according to the terms of this chapter, such person or entity shall include in
all plans and specifications submitted to the City Council the location and
dimensions of all proposed fire lanes required by this chapter.
   (C)   City Council approval of any proposed fire lane required by this
chapter shall be based on the adequacy of access to structures on the subject
property provided by the proposed fire lane. A fire lane may be provided in an
off-loading roadway on the subject property in lieu of providing a fire lane in
a parking facility, if the City Council, in its discretion, determines that the
off-loading roadway provides adequate access by emergency vehicles to
structures on the subject property.
   (D)   All required fire lanes shall be delineated by a red stripe on the
pavement marking the outside boundary from the curb of the fire lane. In
addition, signs shall be conspicuously placed along the curb nearest the fire
lane indicating the existence of the fire lane, and indicating that parking
therein is prohibited.
§ 150.607 VARIANCES.
   All requests for a variance from the requirements of this chapter must be
submitted in writing to the City Council. The City Council may authorize a
variance from the requirements imposed by this chapter when, in its opinion,
undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance or when alternative
compliance will satisfy the purpose of this chapter.
BLASTING PERMITS
§ 150.620 GENERAL.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to use explosives within the city limits
for the purpose of preparing building sites, loosening rock, demolition of any
building or structure and for other purposes without first obtaining a permit
therefor from the Council or Council designate.
§ 150.621 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   To obtain a blasting permit, the applicant shall first file an application
therefor in writing. Each such application shall include the following:
   (A)   Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which
application is made. The application shall designate the maximum capacity of
the explosives to be used and number of charges to be set off at one time, the
proposed date and time(s) of use, the location(s) where such explosives are to
be used and stored, and a safety plan to protect property and lives.
   (B)   Name of the licensed blaster who will engage in the use of explosives.
   (C)   Applicant's signature, or authorized agent, who may be required to
submit evidence to indicate such authority.
   (D)   Other such reasonable information as may be required by the Council or
Council designate.
§ 150.622 APPROVAL BY CITY.
   It is hereby determined that unsafe blasting is dangerous to life, health or
property and that the public health, safety, and welfare requires regulation.
Blasting permits can only be approved by the City Council of Sunset Valley.
§ 150.623 DENIAL OF PERMIT WHICH ENDANGERS LIFE, HEALTH OR PROPERTY.
   (A)   When in the opinion of the Council or Council designate there exists
the potential for danger to life, health, real property, personal property,
water wells, roadways and/or utility lines or structures in the immediate area
exposed to the blasting for which a permit has been requested or issued, said
permit may be denied or revoked. Should Council or Council designate determine,
however, that a reduced scope or blasting plan could be accommodated without
the apparent potential for danger to life, health or property as described
above, then Council or Council designate may request that said permit
application be amended.
   (B)   In no case shall a permit be granted or issued for any blasting
activities to be located within the critical water quality zone (CWQZ) of any
streams in the city as defined in the provisions of the Code regulating the
city's watershed.
   (C)   If said permit application is amended in accordance with the request
and comments of the Council, then the amended permit may be approved and issued
by Council.
§ 150.624 COMMENTS FROM ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS AND UTILITIES.
   The Council or Council designate may request written comments on each permit
application from the various affected utilities, adjacent property owners, or
franchise holders. When in the opinion of the Council or Council designate,
such utility or adjacent property owner or franchise holder has a valid
objection to the issuance of a permit, no permit shall be approved until such
objection has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Council.
§ 150.625 NO SMOKING IN VICINITY OF BLASTING.
   No person shall smoke or carry matches, lighters or other such combustible
materials while handling explosives or while in the vicinity thereof. "No
Smoking" signs shall be posted in areas where explosives are being handled. The
signs shall be visible for at least 50 feet.
§ 150.626 BLASTING MAT.
   When blasting is done in a congested area or in close proximity to a
building, structure, highway, vehicle, conveyance or any other installation
that may be damaged by material being thrown into the air, the blast shall be
covered with an adequate blasting mat or shield. Proof that any such building
structure, highway, vehicle, conveyance or other installation was damaged to
any degree by material which was so thrown into the air shall raise a
rebuttable presumption that said blast was not covered with an adequate
blasting mat or shield. For purposes of this section, an otherwise adequate
blasting mat used improperly shall not be considered to be an adequate blasting
mat or shield.

or accident, shall be treated immediately with commercial pruning paint to seal
the surface from contamination. The Urban Forester may conduct unannounced
inspections to ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
§ 150.660 DISINFECTION OF EQUIPMENT.
   Equipment used for pruning or cutting of oak species (Quercus spp.) in
public projects will be disinfected after each tree is completely cut and
before proceeding to the next tree. A solution of nine parts water to one part
bleach is recommended for disinfection of all pruning and cutting equipment,
however spray disinfectants or a solution of four parts water to one part
isopropyl alcohol are also suitable. Tool surfaces that contact any part of the
tree should be thoroughly coated with the disinfecting solution. On chain saws
the drive sprocket and interior surfaces should also be disinfected. This
disinfection procedure is highly recommended for private projects.

   (E)   Landscaping credits. The following may receive credits toward
landscaping and buffering requirements:
      (1)   Existing preserved tree credit. An existing surveyed or planted
tree which is at least four inches shall be considered as two trees for
purposes of satisfying requirements of this division. Up to one third of the
required trees may be Juniperus virginiana or Juniperus ashei, the native
eastern and western cedars, respectively; and/or Prosopsis glandulosus, the
native mesquite. Trees that are excluded from protection per §§
150.770 through
150.788 cannot be considered for credit.
      (2)   Drip line credit. The impervious cover within the area encompassed
by the drip line of any existing tree in a required landscaped area may not
exceed 50% of such area. Each square foot of permeable surface below the drip
line of the existing preserved tree shall count as 125% square feet of
landscape credit. Trees for which extra credit is being applied shall be
inspected prior to, during and at time of final inspection for healthiness and
probability of survival. Credit shall be subject to the following limitations:
         (a)   Overlapping drip line cannot be counted twice.
         (b)   No credit will be given where damaging grade changes within the
drip line of a tree has occurred.
         (c)   No storage of materials or vehicular traffic is to be permitted
in this area in order to prevent compaction of soil.
         (d)   The total credit for the tree drip line cannot exceed the total
footage within the drip line. The total credit must be equal or less than 100%
of the area within the drip line
      (3)   Pedestrian amenities. For each square foot of publicly accessible
special pedestrian facilities and features such as plazas, covered walkways,
fountains, lakes and decorative water ponds, seating areas and outdoor
recreation facilities; such areas will reduce the amount of required landscaped
area of the site by an equivalent square footage up to only 10% of the required
landscaped street yard.
      (4)   Berm credit. Landscape areas incorporating berms a minimum of three
feet in height will be given 5% additional credit toward reducing square
footage requirements for landscaped areas. Berms must have no greater than
three to one slope.
      (5)   Proposed trees credits. Newly planted trees of at least four
caliper inches and at least twelve 12 feet tall shall be considered as one and
one-half trees for purposes of satisfying the requirements of this chapter. All
newly planted trees shall be planted in a permeable area whose minimum
dimension is no less than 15 feet wide measured from the back of the curb
   (F)   In no case shall the actual landscaped area of a lot be less than 80%
of the required minimum area of the street yard.
§ 150.675 TURF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   General. Traditional grass areas are not required in Sunset Valley.
The city invites innovative and environmentally appropriate alternatives to
turf grass monocultures. Such areas may be established in native diverse
species which have low water requirements. A major portion of water demand used
for landscape purposes is required for the irrigation of turf areas. Portions
of landscaped areas that have been customarily designed as lawns should be
designed instead as:
      (1)   Natural plant communities;
      (2)   Redeveloped native areas including native grasses;
      (3)   Traditional mixes of trees, shrubs and groundcovers. Properly
managed non-grass landscape developments of site specific plantings will
typically be able to survive on a reduced water requirement and survive drought
conditions better than turf areas.
   (B)   Maximum allowable turf areas. No more than 25% of the required
landscape area shall be planted in turf grass. Grasses must be drought-tolerant
species and when possible allowed to seed to encourage to natural reseeding.
Right-of-way adjacent to development will not be included in this calculation.
   (C)   Turf selection. Turf selection shall be made from those grasses found
on the Sunset Valley Recommended Plant List.
§ 150.676 VEGETATIVE BUFFER REQUIREMENT.
   Vegetative buffer requirement. There shall be a vegetative buffer zone of 25
feet next to the right-of-way lines of all streets and roadways.
   (A)   No improvements, including parking areas, water quality ponds, and
fences, shall be allowed in the vegetative buffer zone. Driveways will only be
allowed within the vegetative buffer when perpendicular (center line of
driveway) to the right-of-way thus allowing access from a public street to a
parking facility.
   (B)   Except for clearing necessary to provide utilities access and site
line visibility to the site, no clearing of vegetation shall be permitted
within the vegetative buffer zone. Indiscriminate clearing regulations are
found within §
150.785.
   (C)   In cases where the buffer area has previously been substantially
disturbed, it shall be restored to provide a varied landscape buffer utilizing
trees, shrubs, and grasses in accordance with the other provisions of this
chapter.
§ 150.677 LANDSCAPING IN PARKING AREAS.
   (A)   Vehicular use areas, parking areas, service areas, parking lots and
their parked vehicles shall be required one point of landscape buffering (refer
to §
150.683) for each linear foot of required landscaping along the property line.
If non-residential vehicular use areas, parking area, service area, or parking
lot are adjacent to residential property, compatibility and buffering standards
shall apply. These standards are separate and apart from the landscaping
regulations and found in §
150.105.
   (B)   A minimum total area of 120 square feet of landscaped islands,
peninsulas and medians is required for each 12 parking spaces anywhere on the
site, including the street yard. Concrete curbs shall not be counted in the
required landscape areas.
   (C)   The number, size, and shape of islands, peninsulas, and medians in
both street yards and non-street yards shall be at the discretion of the owner;
however, no parking space shall be located further than 50 feet from a
permeable landscaped island, peninsula, or median. This distance should be
measured from the back of curb of the landscaped island, median or peninsula
and should encompass the entire parking space. All islands, peninsulas and
medians required in the areas stated above shall be more or less evenly
distributed throughout such parking areas, respectively; however, the
distribution and location of landscaped islands, peninsulas, and medians may be
adjusted to accommodate existing trees or other natural features so long as the
total area requirement for landscaped islands, peninsulas, and medians for the
respective parking areas above is satisfied.
   (D)   Only landscaped islands, peninsulas, and medians in the street yard
shall count toward fulfilling the requirements of §
150.674(A) above, as applicable.
   (E)   Each parking aisle shall be terminated with an end island whose
minimum dimension is 15 feet wide from the inside of the curb.
   (F)   Each parking island is required to have at least one tree.
   (G)   Special provisions for large parking lots.
      (1)   The above division (C) does not apply if this division (G) is
required. For parking lots with more than three parking modules, a 15 foot
minimum width median (measured from back of curb) will be required for every
third parking module. Trees within the median must be located so that one tree
shall be located within 25 feet of each parking space adjacent to the median.
This distance should be measured as the distance from the center of the tree to
the edge of each parking space. No additional islands shall be required to
satisfy §
150.674 except for end islands for each parking module.
      (2)   A pedestrian walkway shall be provided within the boundaries of
each fifteen foot wide (minimum) median. The walkway shall provide pedestrian
access connecting the parking lot and the commercial establishment's entry
(ies). The walkway shall meet all accessibility requirements.
§ 150.678 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL CHARACTER.
   (A)   Preservation of natural character. The natural landscape character
(especially native trees, grasses and geology) shall be preserved or restored
to the extent reasonable and feasible. In determining whether there is
compliance with this division the City Council designate shall consider
topographical constraints on design, drainage, access and egress, utilities,
and other factors reasonably related to the health, safety and welfare of the
public which necessitated disturbance of the existing natural landscape
character; economic usefulness of the property without disturbance of its
natural character; the nature and quality of the landscaping installed to
replace it; and such other factors as may be relevant and proper.
Indiscriminate clearing or stripping of the natural vegetation on a lot is
prohibited as per §§
150.770 through
150.788.
   (B)   When existing natural plant communities occur on a parcel of land to
be developed, at least 20% of the required landscape area shall be in the form
of preserved native plant communities.
§ 150.679 WATER-EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE DESIGN.
   (A)   Xeriscape principles. It is the intent of this chapter to assist the
city in achieving water conservation through proper plant selection,
installation and maintenance practices. The following Xeriscape principles
serve as the primary means of achieving water conservation:
      (1)   Appropriate planning and design;
      (2)   Limiting turf areas to locations where it provides functional
benefits;
      (3)   Efficient, low water use irrigation systems;
      (4)   The use of soil amendments to improve water holding capacity of the
soil;
      (5)   The use of mulches to maintain soil moisture and reduce
evaporation;
      (6)   Zoning of plant materials according to their microclimate needs and
water requirements;
      (7)   The use of drought-tolerant plants from the Sunset Valley
Recommended Plant List; and,
      (8)   Appropriate and timely maintenance.
   (B)   Site development standards. Creative site development concepts shall
be used in order to promote resource conservation. These standards include:
      (1)   The preservation of existing native plant communities.
      (2)   The re-establishment of native plant communities.
      (3)   Limiting the amount of turf areas.
      (4)   Landscaped areas shall be configured to maximize the
interconnectivity within the site to natural areas and landscaped areas
adjacent to development. Small isolated islands of landscaping should be
avoided except as required for screening along roadways and within parking
lots.
      (5)   Landscape design shall enhance natural features, drainage ways and
environmental resources.
      (6)   All landscape improvements shall be designed for mature landscapes
and shall provide appropriate visibility for cars and pedestrians. Landscape
design shall consider the view of store fronts and signage for vehicular
access.
      (7)   The use of shade trees to reduce transpiration rates of lower story
plant materials.
      (8)   Incorporate elements of gateway, path and destination into the
design of landscapes. Gateways are entries that provide transitions from one
space to another. Pathways are routes that lead to a destination. Destinations
are focal points. The use of pervious paving materials is encouraged.
      (9)   Plants having similar water use shall be grouped in distinct hydro
zones, shown on the landscaping plan.
      (10)   High hydro zones shall be separated from low and very low hydro
zones by moderate hydro zones whenever possible.
      (11)   Planting strips less than ten feet wide shall be planted with low
or very low water use plants.
      (12)   Decorative water features must use recirculated water and are
subject to drought restrictions.
      (13)   Plants shall be selected to blend with native vegetation for
projects that interface between urban areas and natural open spaces. Plants
with low fuel volume and/or low flammability shall be emphasized.
§ 150.680 WATER-EFFICIENT IRRIGATION DESIGN.
   (A)   Irrigation. All required landscaping shall be irrigated by one of the
following methods:
      (1)   An underground sprinkling automatic irrigation system - either
conventional spray, bubblers, drip emitters, drip tubing, porous pipe or other
similar system.

landscaped areas and plant materials where there is no road or parking pavement
between the hose attachment and landscaped areas and the site plan area is no
larger than one acre.
      (3)   Landscape areas planted with native grasses and wildflowers may use
a temporary and above ground irrigation system in accordance with the design
criteria outlined herein and shall be required to provide irrigation only for
the first two growing seasons. The irrigation schedule is to be determined at
time of planting and approved by the city or its designated agents.
      (4)   Hand watering may be considered for low and very low hydro zones.
      (5)   Use of non-treated water for irrigation is encouraged if a
permanent suitable supply is available §
150.688 details credits and approved methods for innovative water management.
      (6)   Irrigation shall not be required for natural areas or existing
trees which are not disturbed or affected by the proposed development.
   (B)   The irrigation methods used shall:
      (1)   Provide a moisture level in an amount and frequency adequate to
sustain growth of the plant materials on a permanent basis;
      (2)   Be in place and operational at the time of the final landscape
inspection.
      (3)   Be maintained and kept operational at all times to provide for
efficient water distribution;
      (4)   Be described in the landscape plans by a detail and drawing,
indicating the nature and location of the irrigation methods which will be
used. The description should be specific enough to show that adequate
irrigation will be provided to all required landscape areas and plant materials
and that there is no disturbance to the critical root zones of existing trees.
      (5)   Turf zones and non-turf areas shall be on separate valves.
      (6)   Drip emitters and sprinklers shall be placed on separate valves.
      (7)   Bubblers for trees shall be placed on a separate valve. Bubblers
shall not exceed one and one-half gallons per minute (gpm) for each device.
      (8)   Each valve shall irrigate a landscape with similar site, slope, and
soil conditions and plant material with similar watering needs.
      (9)   Special attention shall be given to avoid runoff from slopes and to
avoid overspray.
   (C)   Irrigation system requirements. Automatic irrigation systems shall
comply with the following guidelines. These guidelines (division (C)(1) through
(C)(8)) shall be noted on the site plan and shall be implemented as part of the
landscape inspection.
      (1)   Adjustable flow controls shall be required on circuit remote
control valves. Pressure regulation component(s) shall be required where static
pressure exceeds manufacturer's recommended operating range.
      (2)   Valves and circuits shall be separated based on water use, so that
turf areas can be watered separately from shrub and groundcover areas.
      (3)   Sprinkler heads shall have matched precipitation rates within each
control valve circuit.
      (4)   Serviceable check valves shall be required where elevation
differential may cause low head drainage adjacent to paving areas.
      (5)   Sprinkler head spacing shall be designed for head-to-head coverage
or heads shall be spaced as per manufacturer's recommendations and adjusted for
prevailing winds. The system shall be designed for minimum run-off and minimum
overspray onto non-irrigated areas (i.e. paving and structures).
      (6)   All automatic irrigation systems shall be equipped with a
controller capable of dual or multiple programming. Controllers shall have
multiple cycle start capacity and a flexible calendar program, including the

shall be equipped with a rain and freeze sensor shut-off device.
      (7)   System must be designed to be able to water all zones within a
maximum 15-hour period per week.
      (8)   Irrigation construction plans shall include a water budget that
conforms with allowable landscaping water budget in §
150.681(A). A laminated copy of the water budget shall be permanently installed
inside the irrigation controller door. Water budgets shall include:
         (a)   Estimated monthly water use (in gallons per application) and the
area (in square feet) irrigated.
         (b)   Precipitation rates for each valve circuit.
         (c)   Monthly irrigation schedule for the plant establishment period
(first three months) and recommended yearly watering schedule, including
seasonal adjustments.
         (d)   Location of emergency irrigation system shut-off valve.
§ 150.681 LANDSCAPE WATER CONSERVATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Dedicated landscape water meter and backflow device.
      (1)   Separate water meters shall be required for all new landscaping or
renovated landscaped areas that have a construction area of new landscaping
larger than 5,000 square feet.
      (2)   All irrigation systems must have a backflow device as required by
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
   (B)   Landscape water budget. The landscape water budget for new landscape
shall be no more than 70% of reference evapotranspiration per square foot of
landscaped area, including turf grass. The landscape water budget shall be
calculated using the equation below:
      (1)   Landscape water budget = (0.7)(ETo)(0.00083)(LA);
         (a)   Water budget =annual upper limit of irrigation water allowed.
(CCF/year);
         (b)   0.7=ET adjustment factor;
         (c)   ETo=Reference evapotranspiration;
         (d)   Conversion factor to CCF;
         (e)   LA=Landscape area (square feet).
      (2)   New landscapes that are irrigated with non-potable water are
allowed a total of 100% of evapotranspiration rate per square foot. Acceptable
alternatives for non-potable water can be found in §
150.688.
      (3)   The annual water use shall not exceed the annual water budget.
§ 150.682 BUFFERING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Required buffers. Buffering is a site specific requirements that shall
be evaluated based on viewer distance and angle of view from the areas or
features that require buffering. Buffer design should also consider the amount
of view obstruction required and the type and mixture of design elements.
Compatibility and buffering are required wherever a property other than
residential abuts adjacent residential property. The buffer shall comply with
the requirements outlined in the §
150.105.
   (B)   Non-residential property adjacent to residential property. Wherever a
vehicular use area, parking area, service area, utility appurtenances or
parking lot serving a non-residential property abuts adjacent residential
property, the requirement outlined in §
150.105 shall apply.
      (1)   Effective buffering of residential districts from all other
districts, except, park, greenspace/preservation, and conservation areas shall
include a minimum 100 feet landscape setback.
      (2)   The landscaping requirements of this chapter cannot be met within
the landscape setback required pursuant to §
150.105.
   (C)   Buffering of water quality and utility improvements. Landscape
buffering requirements outlined under the requirements of §
150.682 shall also apply to detention ponds, sedimentation ponds and filtration
and utility appurtenances.
   (D)   Non-residential property adjacent to non-residential property.
Landscape buffering of non-residential property adjacent to non-residential
property is a site specific requirement that shall be evaluated by the city or
its designated agent based on viewer distance and angle of view from the areas
or site features requiring buffering. Such areas or site features requiring
landscape buffering include, but are not limited to, vehicular use areas,
parking lots and their parked cars, and , service areas,. Buffer design shall
also consider the amount of view obstruction required and the type and mixture
of design elements used in the buffer.
§ 150.683 BUFFERING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Buffering standards. To be considered effective, a combination of
buffering elements shall be used to provide a partial view obstruction of those
items to be buffered (pavement, parked cars, etc.).
      (1)   Landscape buffers shall contain at least two of the following
elements:
         (a)   Trees;
         (b)   Shrubs; or
         (c)   Berms.
      (2)   Plants and trees used as buffering elements shall be planted in a
permeable landscape area at least 15 feet wide, measured from back of curb,
pavement, or face of building to the property line. All plantings shall conform
to the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   To determine the quantity of elements to be included in a buffer,
the following point system should be used. This system assigns a point value to
each landscape element listed above. The values for these elements are found in
Table 13.2.
      (4)   For each linear foot of buffer area required, one point of
buffering element as listed above should be provided within the buffer area.
The buffer area does not have to be planted at the same density throughout.
However, the elements should be combined so that no more than one-quarter of
the buffer area is absent of elements and no less than two elements are used
for more than 50% of the buffer length.
      (5)   All required landscaping must be accomplished within the boundaries
of the site being developed. Landscaping accomplished in any dedicated right-
of-way shall not be included in meeting the landscaping or buffering
requirements imposed by this chapter. Landscaping areas preserved or planted
for the purpose of preserving or creating drainage ways, detention ponds, or
sedimentation ponds shall not be included in satisfying the landscaping
requirements provided by this chapter, except that the top one-third of the
depth of such landscaped drainage way, detention pond, or sedimentation pond
may be included in satisfying landscaping requirements.
      (6)   Fifty percent of proposed landscaped plantings must be conspicuous,
e.g., blooming material.

§ 150.684 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   Minimum requirements. Each newly built residential home where only one
primary residence is constructed shall meet these minimum standards:
   (A)   All disturbed areas and bare ground must be revegetated with approved
grass and/or wildflower seed. Sod shall be used in areas with greater than 5%
slope. Mulch and erosion control blanket may be used for temporary
stabilization of the area.
   (B)   Grass and seed selection must be from the Sunset Valley Recommended
Plant List.
   (C)   If a lot has fewer than five existing, mature trees, two minimum one
and one-half caliper trees chosen from the large tree replacement list found in
§
150.783 must be planted.
   (D)   All planting and seeding must occur before issuance of a certificate
of occupancy.
   (E)   Revegetated areas must be established before environmental controls
can be removed.
   (F)   A dedicated irrigation meter and backflow device shall be required.
§ 150.685 LANDSCAPE MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Shrubs, vines and ground cover. Shrubs, vines and ground cover planted
pursuant to this chapter should be good, healthy nursery stock normally grown
for or found growing in the Travis County area. Plant materials which are
native or naturalized and have low water requirements are highly recommended.
Shrubs must be, at a minimum, a one gallon container size.
   (B)   Plant quality standards. Plants installed pursuant to this chapter
shall conform to or exceed the minimum standard as provided in the most current
edition of American Standards for Nursery Stock (ASNS) recommended for general
use and adoption by the American Association of Nurserymen. Another accepted
standard may be used if it equals or exceeds the quality of the ASNS.
   (C)   Plant ball sizes. Ball sizes on all transplanted plant materials shall
conform to or exceed the minimum standards as noted in the most current edition
of ASNS.
   (D)   Turf grass. Traditional grass areas are not required in Sunset Valley.
The city invites innovative and environmentally appropriate alternatives to
turf grass monocultures. Such areas may be established in native diverse
species which have low water requirements. Grass areas using grass not listed
on the Sunset Valley Recommended Plant List are not credited as landscaped
area. In shaded turf areas (areas that receive less than six hours of sunlight
per day), a shade-tolerant, low water use grass may be used. Areas may be
sodded, plugged, sprigged or seeded except that solid sod shall be used in
swales or other areas subject to erosion.
   (E)   Synthetic lawns or plants. Synthetic or artificial lawns or plants
shall not be used in lieu of plant requirements in this chapter. These products
do not provide ecological services and may increase the heat island effect.
   (F)   Architectural planters. The use of architectural planters shall not be
permitted in fulfillment of landscape requirements, but may be used in addition
to landscaping requirements.
   (G)   Drainage. Drainage ways shall be designed and maintained so as to
maximize the use of native vegetation on the bottoms and sides.
   (H)   Species. No more than 35% of the trees or shrubs shall be from the
same species within a specified genus. No more than 25% of planted trees,
shrubs and groundcover shall be from the same genus.
   (I)   Weed control fabric. All weed control fabric must be pervious and
allow water to flow freely into the ground.
§ 150.686 INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General minimum requirements. The following standards shall be
considered the minimum requirements for the installation of all landscaping
within Sunset Valley.
      (1)   Installation requirements. All landscape materials shall be
installed according to ASNS standards. This requirement will be monitored by
the city or its designated agent.
      (2)   Anti-transpirants - general. In order to reduce the transpiration
rate of plant material during the installation process, anti-transpirants may
be used. Anti-transpirants reduce the amount of water loss through the leaves
of plant material during installation, thereby reducing the amount of water
required for the survival of the plants. Anti-transpirants may be used on all
permitted landscape installation projects.
      (3)   It shall be the responsibility of each private property owner to
remove any dead, diseased or dangerous trees or shrubs, or parts thereof, which
overhang or interfere with traffic control devices, public sidewalks, rights-
of-way or property owned by the city. The city shall have the authority to
order the removal of any such trees or shrubs.
   (B)   Watering.
      (1)   All watering of planted areas shall be managed so as to:
         (a)   Maintain healthy flora.
         (b)   Make plant material more drought tolerant.
         (c)   Avoid excessive turf growth.
         (d)   Minimize fungus growth.
         (e)   Stimulate deep root growth.
         (f)   Minimize leaching of fertilizer.
         (g)   Minimize cold damage.
         (h)   Minimize runoff.
      (2)   Watering of turf areas. All watering of turf areas shall be
accomplished on an as needed basis. Buffalo grass may not require watering even
when wilting. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed so as to preclude the
withholding of water from turf beyond the stage of turf wilt.
      (3)   Promoting deep root growth of trees and shrubs. Watering of plants
and trees should always be in a sufficient amount to thoroughly soak the root
ball of the plant and the surrounding area, thereby promoting deep root growth
and tolerance.
      (4)   Operation of automatic irrigation systems. Whenever possible,
automatic irrigation systems should be operated between the hours of midnight
and 6:00 a.m. or as designated by the City of Sunset Valley. Irrigating during
these hours reduces fungus growth and loss of water due to evaporation.
      (5)   Maintenance of irrigation systems. Irrigation systems shall be
constantly maintained to eliminate waste of water due to loss of heads, broken
pipes or misadjusted nozzles and to adjust controller programs to reflect
weather changes.
      (6)   All watering schedules must comply with applicable Sunset Valley
water restrictions during droughts.
   (C)   Maintenance and replacement of dead material. The owner of the
building, or the manager or agent of the owner, shall be responsible for the
appearance of landscaping at all times and landscaping shall be kept free of
refuse and debris. Ongoing maintenance shall include the replacement of dead
plant material if that material was used to meet the requirements of this
chapter. Should a tree die or be removed from which credit has been obtained
pursuant to the terms of §
150.674, a smaller tree with a minimum caliper of two inches that will have a
mature crown similar to the tree removed must be substituted within six months
and the planting area or pervious cover provided for the larger tree retained.
   (D)   The required two to four-inch mulch layer shall be maintained on all
landscape projects.
§ 150.687 REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   Replacement requirements: Vegetation which is required to be planted or
preserved by this chapter shall be replaced with equivalent vegetation.
Preserved trees for which credit was awarded which subsequently die shall be
replaced by the requisite number of living trees according to the standards
established in §
150.674.
§ 150.688 CREDIT FOR INNOVATIVE WATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Water budget credit. Projects that use alternative non-potable water
sources or smart irrigation controllers will be able to use 100% of their water
budget.
   (B)   Rainwater harvesting. Rainwater from rooftops can be collected onsite
and used for irrigation. For this application the rainwater harvesting tank
will also be exempted from impervious cover calculations when used for
irrigation of landscaped areas.
      (1)   Tank must be sized to collect four inches of rainfall per square
foot of rooftop.
      (2)   Projects that include rainwater harvesting will also receive a
reduction of 5% of the required landscape area when used for irrigation of
landscaped areas.
      (3)   Rainwater harvesting tanks for this application shall not be used
to meet water quality treatment requirements of site per §§
150.320 through
150.349.
   (C)   Rain gardens.
      (1)   Rain gardens that are lined with impervious liner and complies with
rain garden design specifications in the pollution reduction manual will be
exempted from the water budget calculations.
      (2)   Rain garden must be equal in size to 10% of the total requirement
of the street yard landscape area.
   (D)   Disconnected downspouts from rooftops.
      (1)   These downspouts must be directed into landscaping beds.
      (2)   Disconnected downspouts used in conjunction with lined rain gardens
will receive an additional 5% reduction of the required landscape area.
   (E)   Evapotranspiration and smart irrigation controllers. The use of
evapotranspiration systems or smart irrigation controllers that regulate water
use may be considered for additional water budget credit.
§ 150.689 VARIANCES AND ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Except in regards to buffering standards found in §
150.105, the City Council may authorize a variance from these regulations when,
in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In
granting a variance, the Council shall prescribe only conditions that it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest. In making the findings herein
below required, the Council shall take into account the nature of the proposed
use of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of
persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable
effect of such variance upon traffic conditions and upon the public health,
safety, convenience and welfare in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted
unless the Council finds:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this
chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land;
      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area.
   (B)   Alternative compliance. Notwithstanding all of the foregoing
provisions of this chapter, a landscape site plan which is an alternative to
strict compliance with the various landscaping requirements of this chapter may
be approved by the City Council, if the Council finds that such plan is as good
or better than a plan in strict compliance with the various landscaping
requirements of this chapter in accomplishing the purposes of this chapter.
Consideration should be given to preservation of heritage and ancestral trees
which are not necessarily in required landscape areas. In no event, however,
will landscaping or buffering within a dedicated right-of-way constitute
alternative compliance with the requirements imposed by this chapter, nor shall
such landscaping or buffering be deemed to satisfy any requirement of this
chapter.
      (1)   Alternative proposals should be clearly identified on the landscape
plans and the site plan application should include a letter outlining the
alternative proposal. Review of the alternative proposal will be in conjunction
with the site plan review.
      (2)   To establish some guideline equivalents for the major landscape
requirements listed in §
150.674, a list of alternative equivalent ratings are found below. These
ratings assign relative values to the landscape elements of a design and should
be used when formulating alternative proposals. Each basic requirement which
cannot be achieved is assigned a negative point value and may be compensated
for with positive equivalents shown in the compensation list. An example using
this concept is provided below:
         (a)   These ratings are intended to provide guidance for proposing
alternatives to strict compliance for unusual site specific conditions.
However, other proposed equivalents may be accepted based on extremely unusual
conditions, if approved by the City Council.
         (b)   Deficiencies. The following information should be used to
formulate alternative proposals when a site design cannot conform to the basic
landscape requirements as described in §
150.674. Approved alternative compliance proposals must be from the Sunset
Valley Recommended Plant List.

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 150.700 PURPOSE AND GOALS.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide uniform sign standards that
perform the following:
      (1)   Promote a positive image of the city;
      (2)   Protect an important aspect of the economic base;
      (3)   Reduce the confusion and hazards that result from excessive and
prolific use of sign displays;
      (4)   Ensure that no hazard is created due to collapse, wind, fire,
collision, decay or abandonment; that no obstruction is created to fire
fighting and police surveillance; and no traffic hazard is created by confusing
or distracting motorists, or by impairing the driver's ability to see
pedestrians, obstacles, or other vehicles, or to read traffic signs;
      (5)   Promote efficient transfer of information in sign message by
providing that businesses and services may identify themselves; customers and
other persons may locate a business or service; and persons exposed to signs
are not overwhelmed by the number of messages presented, and are able to
exercise freedom of choice to observe or ignore said messages, according to the
observer's purpose; and
      (6)   Protect the public welfare and enhance the appearance an economic
value of the landscape by providing signs that do not interfere with scenic
views; do not create a nuisance to persons using the public right-of-ways; do
not constitute a nuisance to occupancy of adjacent and contiguous property by
their brightness, size, height, or movement; are not detrimental to land or
property value; and, contribute to the special character of particular areas or
districts within the city, helping the observer to understand the city and
orient oneself within it.
   (B)   By recognizing this purpose, this chapter shall serve to strengthen
the economic stability of business, cultural, and residential areas in the
city; recognizing that visual clutter leads to decline in the community's
appearance, in property values, and in the effectiveness of the signs.
   (C)   The goals of this chapter are to preserve the integrity of our
community, promote pride in our
neighborhoods, promote safe egress/ingress on public roadways, and encourage
the effectiveness of signs.
   (D)   In the event of conflicts, actual or perceived, in the terms or
requirements of this chapter, the most restrictive interpretation shall apply.
§ 150.701 FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
   This chapter shall not be construed, applied, interpreted, nor enforced in a
manner to violate the First Amendment rights of any person, and the Building
Official shall seek the advice and recommendation of the City Attorney prior to
taking any action to enforce any provision of this chapter with respect to any
non-commercial sign or speech by any person. No provision of this chapter shall
be construed in a manner as to violate of the Tex. Loc. Gov't Code § 216.903
(protecting certain political signs).
§ 150.702 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Authority. The Building Official and the City Administrator are hereby

this chapter, the Building Official or City Administrator may enter such
building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform

moved, structurally altered, structurally repaired, maintained, or used in
violation of this chapter shall be presumed responsible for the violation of
this chapter.
§ 150.704 SIGN MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND REMOVAL.

   The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as relieving or
limiting in any way the responsibility or liability of any person, firm or
corporation erecting or owning any sign from personal injury or property damage
resulting from the placing of the sign, or resulting from the negligence or
willful acts of such person, firm or corporation, its agents, employees or
workmen, in the design, construction, maintenance, repair or removal of any

§ 150.730 PURPOSE; LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   In order to lessen practical difficulties and prevent unnecessary

   (B)   With respect to signs or outdoor advertising, along Highway 290 or any
other portion of the Interstate Highway system or federal-aid Primary Highway
system within the city and/or its area of extraterritorial jurisdiction, which

Department of Highways and Public Transportation regulations, no variance shall
be granted from spacing, size and lighting requirements when such would result
in less stringent regulation than that provided for under those regulations.
   (C)   Except for the foregoing, a variance may be granted allowing minor
exceptions to the regulations contained in this chapter, in those instances in
which a substantial injustice would result unless the minor exceptions were

buildings, topography, vegetation, sign structures or other matters on adjacent
lots or within the adjacent right-of-way, which would substantially restrict
the effectiveness of the sign in question; provided, however, that such special
circumstances or conditions are unique to the particular business or enterprise
to which the applicant desires to draw attention, and do not apply generally to
all businesses or enterprises;
   (B)   That such special circumstances were not created by the applicant or
anyone in privy to the applicant;
   (C)   That the granting of the variance will be in general harmony with the
purposes of this chapter, and will not be materially detrimental to the persons
residing or working in the vicinity, to adjacent property, to the neighborhood,
or to the public welfare in general;
   (D)   The variance applied for does not depart from the provisions of this
chapter any more than is required to identify the applicant's business or use;

proposed variance.
§ 150.736 VARIANCE APPROVAL TIME LIMITATION.

site to post a cash deposit of at least $100, or a bond to cover the demolition
or removal of the structure, if the moved structure fails to comply with the
standards of this chapter.
   (D)   Each section of the building must be moved by a bonded mover.
   (E)   The final permit issued to the mover shall describe the terms and
conditions of the move fully. One copy of the permit shall be posted on the
building before the same is moved, and retained thereon until the conditions
have been fully met.
   (F)   Move permits shall be issued with a maximum renovation and completion
time of 120 days. The Building Standards Commission may grant an extension of
time.
   (G)   Any move permit which has not been activated within 30 days after
issuance shall expire. In the event no work was ever commenced, the permit may
be renewed without additional charge.
§ 150.754 EXECUTION OF MOVE.
   (A)   No building, or portion thereof, shall be on any street within the
city, except between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:30 a.m.; except, that
certain buildings which are of a size and so loaded and routed as to be quickly
and safely moved without public inconvenience, may be moved over such streets
within the city by special permission of the Building Standards Commission at
other hours. The decision of any one of the departments (police or fire) or
public utilities affected, that moving should not be permitted at any time
other than between 12:00 midnight and 6:30 a.m. shall be final. In the event
that the move cannot be made at its originally scheduled time, the permittee
shall request and obtain written permission for time change before proceeding
with the move.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to permit any building, or portion
thereof, to be on any public street or alley at any time other than the time
stated on the moving permit for such building, or portion thereof.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any permittee to transfer, any permit, or any
rights secured to him by any permit, issued under this section.
   (D)   If the Chief of Police shall find that the protection of public
safety, or property other than vehicles, trailers, dollies, or cargo of the
mover requires a police escort, and shall so advise the Building Official, such
fact shall be specified on the moving permit, and it shall be unlawful for such
building to be moved along or across any street or public place within the city
unless accompanied by a uniformed police escort as required by the Chief of
Police. It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse or fail to comply with
any lawful order or direction of any police officer escorting such move. After
the move has been completed, the escorting police officer shall file a written
report of such move with the Building Official.
§ 150.755 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES; VIOLATION; PENALTY.
   (A)   The building or structure to be moved, and the site of the restoration
work, must be kept in a clean and safe condition during repairs and remodeling.
   (B)   Each lot from which a structure or building is moved shall be left in
a clean, raked condition within 30 days after the removal of the structure or
building.
   (C)   Failure to comply with the requirements of this section constitutes a
violation of this chapter.
   (D)   Upon failure to comply with this requirement, the City of Sunset
Valley is then authorized to clean the lot by city contract, or by city forces.
Such expenses incurred by the City of Sunset Valley constitute a lien against
the real property on which the structure stood, and the lien runs with the
land.
§ 150.756 DAMAGE TO PROPERTY.
   If the moving of a building pursuant to this chapter has caused any damage
to public or private property, other than vehicles, trailers, dollies, or cargo
of the mover, the permittee shall forthwith place the same in as good repair as
it was before the permit was granted. Upon his failure to do so within ten days
after notification, the Building Official may cause the necessary repairs to be
made, and the mover shall be responsible for the payment of the costs. The
permittee shall not cut or trim those parts of trees or shrubs, on or over any
public way or place, without permission from the department of public works,
and shall not cut or trim those parts of trees or shrubs, on or over any
private property, without permission from the owner or person in control of
such property. Permits may be withheld from any mover who has willfully and
repeatedly violated the provisions of this Code.
§ 150.757 NEW BUILDINGS.
   Existing buildings which are moved or relocated into the city shall be
considered as new buildings, and shall comply with all the requirements of this
chapter.
TREE AND NATURAL AREA PROTECTION
§ 150.770 PURPOSE.
   Trees are hereby declared to be of great value in the maintenance of the
public health and welfare of the inhabitants of the city and in the
conservation of vital energy resources. Trees have a positive economic benefit
by enhancing property values and making the city an attractive place to live
and do business. These trees should be preserved to the maximum extent feasible
for the health, education and enjoyment of future generations. The purpose of
this subchapter is:
   (A)   To protect, maintain, and manage the city's existing forest resources
by providing regulations relating to the cutting, removal, or destruction of
protected, heritage and ancestral trees;
   (B)   To encourage protection and preservation of the natural environment
and aesthetics of the city;
   (C)   To provide for replacement of trees removed or destroyed;
   (D)   To provide incentives for creative site design which preserves trees
while allowing development; and
   (E)   To provide regulations for the enforcement and administration of tree
protection.
§ 150.771 SIZES AND TYPES OF PROTECTED, HERITAGE AND ANCESTRAL TREES.
   (A)   Protected tree.
      (1)   Protected trees are those with a diameter of ten inches or more,
measured four and one-half feet above natural grade for the majority of large
tree species. A tree with a diameter greater than five inches of the following

§ 150.772 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES.
   It is unlawful for any person to remove any protected, heritage or ancestral
tree without first securing a tree removal permit. It is unlawful for any
person to damage a protected, heritage or ancestral tree, such as damaging over
50% of the critical root zone, tree topping, over-pruning, or chemical
poisoning. It is unlawful for a person to continue work or removal of trees
when the City Arborist has issued a stop work order.
§ 150.773 TREE REMOVAL PERMITTING PROCESS.
   (A)   Protected, heritage or ancestral tree removal through the site plan
process. For commercial and residential site development tree removal requests,
tree surveys, tree protection plans and tree replacement plans shall be
submitted with the building permit application. A tree inventory or partial
tree survey in lieu of a tree survey may be accepted to document trees within
the limits of construction for small residential projects. Final approval of
the site plan shall constitute approval for tree removal.
   (B)   Tree removal permit (no site plan). An application for the removal of
a protected, heritage or ancestral tree must specify:
      (1)   The approximate location of the tree;
      (2)   The diameter of the trunk of the tree, as measured four and one-
half feet above natural grade level;
      (3)   The approximate crown size of the tree;
      (4)   The species and/or common name of the tree;
      (5)   The approximate size of the lot, tract, or parcel on which it is
located;
      (6)   A photograph of the tree;
      (7)   The reason for the proposed removal; and
      (8)   Such other information as may be reasonably required by the city.
§ 150.774 ACTION ON TREE REMOVAL PERMIT APPLICATION.
   Upon receipt of a tree removal permit application, the city shall inspect
the subject tree. The Director of Public Works and Environmental Services upon
recommendation by the City Arborist shall approve or deny the application in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The tree removal permit will be
processed within 15 working days of date of receipt. Approval from the City
Arborist to remove dead or hazardous trees may be given before the permit has
been completed.
§ 150.775 TREE REMOVAL OR RELOCATION.
   (A)   A protected tree may be removed or relocated without replacement once
a tree removal permit is granted if:
      (1)   The protected tree is damaged by natural causes or is diseased
beyond the point of recovery;
      (2)   The protected tree is removed as a safety measure because it is in
danger of falling;
      (3)   The protected tree is dead;
      (4)   Relocating a protected tree to a suitable location that is
beneficial to the long-term growth and survival of the tree on the same
property or off site. The applicant must comply with generally accepted
transplanting methods as described in the urban forest management plan and the
tree survives for a period of two years. During the two-year period, the
applicant is required to provide ongoing watering and monitoring to increase
chance of survival.
   (B)   A protected tree may be removed with replacement if:
      (1)   The protected tree is located as to prevent reasonable access to
the property; or
      (2)   The location of the protected tree precludes all reasonable and
lawful use of the property on which it is located.
   (C)   A heritage or ancestral tree may only be removed if:
      (1)   The tree is dead;
      (2)   The tree is an imminent hazard to life or property and the hazard
cannot be reasonably mitigated without removing the tree; or
      (3)   Is diseased and;
         (a)   Restoration to sound condition is not practicable; or
         (b)   The disease may be transmitted to other trees and endanger their
health.
   (D)   A variance request may be made to City Council to request removal of a
heritage or ancestral tree. The following criteria should be used to determine
variance approval:
      (1)   The applicant has applied for and been denied a variance,
exemption, modification or alternative from another City Code provision which
would eliminate the need to remove the heritage or ancestral tree; and
      (2)   Removal of the heritage or ancestral tree is not based on a
condition caused by the method chosen by the applicant to develop the property,
unless removal of the heritage or ancestral tree will result in a design that
will allow for the maximum provision of ecological service, historic and
cultural value of the trees on the property.
   (E)   Every approval for tree removal shall automatically expire one year
from its effective date
§ 150.776 CONFLICTS WITH OTHER CITY POLICIES AND REGULATIONS.
   In any case where engineering or design standards or city policies or rules
establish conditions that cannot be met in a specific situation without removal
of a protected, heritage or ancestral tree, the City Council shall determine
what specific adverse effect would result from waiver or modification of such
standard, policy, rule or application thereof, to the extent necessary to save
the tree. If the City Council determines that there is no serious and imminent
adverse effect, the standard, policy or rule may be modified or waived. In
circumstances involving regulations under the authority of the Board of
Adjustment, the Board of Adjustment will have determination and modification
authority. All determinations required to be made under this chapter shall be
made before the expiration of 30 working days from the date of the application
for approval for tree removal, except in cases requiring Board of Adjustment
review which will have 60 working days for approval of tree removal.
§ 150.777 CRITICAL ROOT ZONE.
   During construction, temporary tree protection devices shall be installed at
least to the limit of the critical root zone or dripline, whichever is greater,
for any protected, heritage or ancestral trees to be preserved when the
respective critical root zone is within the limits of construction.
§ 150.778 DISTURBANCE TO CRITICAL ROOT ZONE (CRZ).
   A minimum of 50% of the critical root zone must be preserved at natural
grade and with natural ground cover. No cut or fill, any deposit or stockpiling
of earthen materials in their natural state, greater than four inches will be
located closer to the tree trunk than one-half the CRZ radial distance. If more
than 50% of the tree's critical root zone is affected by construction the tree
may be preserved but replacement plantings must be met as part of the
mitigation requirements in accordance with §
150.782 and §
150.783.
§ 150.779 CROWN IMPACTS.
   A maximum amount of 25% of the viable portion of the tree's crown may be
removed. If more than 25% of the trees crown is removed for construction the
tree may be preserved but replacement plantings must be met as part of the
mitigation requirements in accordance with §
150.782 and §
150.783.
§ 150.780 HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES.
   Activities during construction that are hazardous to the health of any
protected, heritage or ancestral trees are prohibited, including but not
limited to the following:
   (A)   Physical damage. Any physical damage, including tree topping, trunk
damage, or over pruning.
   (B)   Equipment cleaning and liquid disposal. Cleaning equipment, depositing
or allowing harmful liquids to flow overland within the critical root zone.
This includes paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, tar or similar
materials.
   (C)   Grade changes. Grade changes within the limits of the critical root
zone unless adequate construction methods are approved by the City Arborist.
   (D)   Impervious paving. Paving with impervious materials within the limits
of the critical root zone and which may reasonably be expected to kill a tree.
   (E)   Material storage. Storing materials intended for use in construction
or allowing waste materials due to excavation for demolition to accumulate
within the limits of the critical root zone.
   (F)   Tree attachments. Attaching to a tree any signs, wires or other items,
other than those of a protective nature.
   (G)   Vehicular traffic. Vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic,
parking or storage within the limits of the critical root zone, other than on
pre-existing approved pavement. This restriction does not apply to single
incident access within the critical root zone for purposes of clearing
underbrush, vehicular access for emergency services, routine utility
maintenance, and emergency restoration of utility services or routine mowing
activities.
   (H)   Utility encroachment. Installation of utilities and appurtenances
within the critical root zone or crown except where approved by the City
Arborist.
   (I)   Excavation and trenching. Excavation and trenching within the limits
of the critical root zone except as approved by the City Arborist.
§ 150.781 TREE PROTECTION PLANS.
   Details and notes prohibiting hazardous activities as generally provided in
the Urban Forest Management Plan shall be included on all tree protection
plans.
§ 150.782 TREE REPLACEMENT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   When protected, heritage or ancestral trees are removed, tree
replacement is required as outlined in
Table 16.401 except in those provisions contained in §
150.775.
   (B)   Replacement trees will also be required to replace any trees that were
planted or identified to be preserved in a tree replacement plan, but died
within two years of the date the certificate of occupancy was issued.
   (C)   Each replacement tree shall be a minimum of two caliper inches unless
otherwise approved by the City Arborist.
   (D)   Available planting area. Replacement trees should be planted on the
site or easement from which existing trees are removed. If this is not
feasible, a person may initiate a proposal to plant trees off-site. This may be
acceptable if the planting site is in reasonable proximity to the project area
and approved by the City Arborist.
   (E)   Survival potential. Before agreeing to any replacement option, the
City Arborist will assess the probability that trees planted will survive. This
typically requires that some type of irrigation system be implemented for a
minimum of two years. Irrigation may not be required if it can be demonstrated
that, given the size and type of trees planted, the planting site and the time
of year the trees are planted, the mortality rate is likely to be low.
   (F)   Quantities of replacement trees.
      (1)   Replacement tree values will be expressed in terms of caliper
inches. The minimum size acceptable for replacement will be two caliper inches.
The replacement schedule is located in
Table 16.401.
      (2)   Any condition requiring the planting of a replacement tree(s) must
be met within 12 months after removal of the protected tree.
      (3)   Table 16.401; tree replacement schedule.

   (G)   Types of replacement trees.
      (1)   In order to enhance the general quality of the urban forest,
certain restrictions will be placed on the types of trees which will be allowed
to serve as replacements for trees removed. Unless site conditions prohibit it,
75% of the total caliper inches of replacement trees must be represented by
large canopy trees (
Table 16.402). The remaining 25% can be a mixture of small trees (
Table 16.402). All trees selected must be suitable to the planting site. A
minimum of five different species must be planted if more than 50 caliper
inches of trees are required. This is to prevent large monocultures of any
single tree species, which increase the chance of disease epidemics. The
planting of thin bark red oaks near oak wilt centers is discouraged.

   (A)   Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council that the design has
been accomplished to preserve the existing natural vegetation of the site.
   (B)   Preserve trees four to ten inches in diameter, to the extent that such
preservation is reasonable and feasible.
   (C)   Show the locations of existing trees above four inches in diameter on
the site plan.
   (D)   Preserve understory and herbaceous vegetation to the extent that such
preservation is reasonable and feasible.
§ 150.785 INDISCRIMINATE CLEARING.
   As understory and smaller plants provide shelter, food, and place to raise
young there shall be no indiscriminate clearing of natural vegetation.
   (A)   The indiscriminate clearing of natural vegetation is prohibited
without first securing approval of the city, except where the clearing is for
the removal of trees or vegetation damaged by natural forces, livestock, and
removal of small, non-protected Ashe Juniper (Juniperus asheii).
   (B)   Application for the indiscriminate clearing of natural vegetation
shall be made on a form provided by the city.
   (C)   Where practicable, an application for the indiscriminate clearing of
natural vegetation shall be combined with any other applications and/or site
plans required for specific development projects.
   (D)   Applications required under this chapter shall be approved or denied
in accordance with the provisions of §
150.784.
§ 150.786 EXCEPTIONS.

§ 150.788 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Stop work order. The City Arborist, Council or other duly authorized
city official may order all work, including site clearing or other site
preparation, stopped on any site where a violation of this chapter or of a
final site plan is found. Any person, including a workman on the site, who
fails to comply with a stop work order shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable as provided for in the penalty section hereof.
   (B)   Revocation of final site plan approval. If the City Council finds,
after notice and hearing, that a significant violation of an approved final
site plan has occurred, the Council may revoke its approval of such site plan.
It shall be unlawful for any person to do any work on the site covered by the
site plan unless and until a new application for site plan approval has been
filed and processed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the
Council grants approval to a new final site plan which corrects the violations
of the original site plan.
   (C)   Injunction and other remedies. Any tree removal or other work done
contrary to any of the provisions of this chapter or to any of the details
contained in any final site plan approved by the City Council or to any of the
conditions imposed in connection with the granting of any application required
by this chapter is hereby declared to be unlawful and shall constitute a
violation of this chapter. The Council may direct the City Attorney to initiate
injunction, mandamus, abatement or any other action available in law or equity
to prevent, enjoin, abate or correct unlawful tree removal or other work.
   (D)   Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision

APPENDIX C: HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RATINGS
   (A)   Determination of degree of health hazard. The health hazard rating of
a material shall be determined by evaluating the potential for harm and the
relative toxicity of the material or mixture of materials as a whole. Table A-
1 applies to human effects data. In the absence of human exposure data, Table
A-2 shall be used as a guideline. Where both acute and chronic exposure data
are available, the data for the worst effect shall be used to develop the
rating.
   Table A-1
   RELATIVE TOXICITY RATING FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
   (Human Exposure by Any Route)
            *   Includes substances which bear a significant relationship to
the development of cancer in man, but excluding the common varieties of skin
cancer.
            **   Allergens are rated according to their sensitizing potential
rather than the severity of an allergic reaction upon re-exposure to a
substance by a sensitized worker.
   Table A-2
   RELATIVE ACUTE TOXICITY CRITERIA
   (B)   Determination of degree of fire hazard.
      (1)   The fire hazard rating of a product shall be determined by
evaluating the potential for harm and the relative flammability of the material
or mixture of materials as a whole, using the criteria which follows:
      (2)   The fire hazard rating of a liquid shall be determined from the
criteria contained in Table A-3 and based on data using the final product
formulation. The test procedures as found in 29 CFR 1910.106 and 107 are
mandatory liquids.
      EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE:   Rating 4
         Materials which on account of their physical form or environmental
conditions can form explosive mixture with air which are readily dispersed in
air, such as dusts of combustible solids and mists or flammable or combustible
liquid droplets.
      HIGHLY FLAMMABLE:   Rating 3
         Liquids and solids that can be ignited under almost all ambient
temperature conditions. This rating shall include:
         Solid materials in the form of coarse dusts which may burn rapidly but
which generally do not form explosive atmospheres with air.
         Solid materials in a fibrous or shredded from which may burn rapidly
and create flash fire hazards, such as cotton, sisal and hemp.
         Materials which burn with extreme rapidity, usually by reason of self-
contained oxygen (e.g., dry nitrocellulose and many organic peroxides).
         Materials which ignite spontaneously when exposed to air or to other
substance.
      MODERATELY COMBUSTIBLE:   Rating 2
         Materials that must be moderately heated or exposed to relatively
highly ambient temperatures before ignition can occur. Materials with this
rating would not under normal conditions form hazardous atmospheres with air,
but under high ambient temperatures or and/or moderate heating may release
vapor in sufficient quantities to produce hazardous atmospheres with air. This
rating shall include solids and semisolids which readily give off flammable
vapors.
      SLIGHTLY COMBUSTIBLE:   Rating 1
         Materials that must be preheated before ignition can occur.
         Materials with this rating require considerable preheating, under all
ambient temperature conditions, before ignition and combustion can occur. This
rating shall include: Materials which will burn in air when exposed to a
temperature of 1,500°F (815°C) for a period of five minutes or less.
      NONCOMBUSTIBLE:   Rating 0
         This group should include any material which will not burn in air when
exposed to a temperature of 1,500°F (815°C) for a period of five minutes.
         The relative ratings are taken from NFPA 704M booklet, with changes in
flash point to reflect current IOTA regulations.
   TABLE A-3
   RELATIVE FLAMMABILITY CRITERIA
   (C)   Determination of degree of reactivity.
      (1)   The reactivity hazard rating of a material shall be determined by
evaluating the potential for harm and the relative reactivity of the material
or mixture of materials as a whole, using the criteria which follow.
      (2)   Materials in this category may be self-reactive by polymerization,
decomposition or condensation and/or reactive with other materials commonly
encountered in the work place. The reactivity in this category often involves
the rapid release of highly hazardous products. The assessment of relative
reactivity requires specific knowledge of what materials may be encountered in
the work place.
      EXTREMELY REACTIVE:   Rating 4
         Materials which in themselves are readily capable of detonation or of
explosive decomposition or explosive reaction at normal temperatures and
pressures. This rating would include materials which are sensitive to
mechanical or localized thermal shock at normal temperatures and pressures.
      HIGHLY REACTIVE:   Rating 3
         Materials which in themselves are capable of detonation or of
explosive decomposition or explosive reaction, but which require a strong
initiating source or which must be heated under confinement before initiation.
This rating should include materials which are sensitive to thermal or
mechanical shock at elevated temperatures and pressures or which react
explosively with water without requiring heat or confinement.
      MODERATELY REACTIVE:   Rating 2
         Materials which in themselves are normally unstable and readily
undergo rapid chemical change but do not detonate. This rating should include
materials which can undergo chemical change with rapid release of energy at
normal temperatures and pressure. It should also include those materials which
may react violently with water or which may form potentially explosive mixtures
with water.
      SLIGHTLY REACTIVE:   Rating 1
         Materials which in themselves are normally stable but which can become
unstable at elevated temperatures and pressures or which may react violently
with water with some release of energy but not violently.
      NONREACTIVE:   Rating 0
         Materials which in themselves are normally stable, even under fire
exposure conditions and which are not reactive with water.
