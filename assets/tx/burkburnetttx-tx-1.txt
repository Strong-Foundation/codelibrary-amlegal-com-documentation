following rules, unless such construction is plainly repugnant to the intent of
the legislative body or of the context of the same ordinance:
   (A) "AND" or "OR." Either conjunction shall include the other as if written
"and/or," if the sense requires it.
   (B) Acts by assistants. When a statute or ordinance requires an act to be
done which, by law, an agent or deputy as well may do as the principal, such
requisition shall be satisfied by the performance of such act by an authorized
agent or deputy.
   (C) Gender; singular and plural; tenses. Words denoting the masculine gender
shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter genders; words in the
singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the
singular; the use of a verb in the present tense shall include the future, if
applicable.
   (D) General term. A general term following specific enumeration of terms is
not to be limited to the class enumerated unless expressly so limited.
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this code as now or later amended or its application to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions that can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application.
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, such
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered unless the subject matter is
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.09 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of this municipality exercising the powers,
duties, or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any
transfer of functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.10 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to expressthe intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and such word
or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
such error.
§ 10.11 OFFICIAL TIME.
   The official time, as established by applicable state and federal law, shall
be the official time within this municipality for the transaction of all
municipal business.
§ 10.12 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A) In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time or
notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of such act or the giving of such notice.
   (B) The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall be
computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day be
Sunday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   This code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code.
§ 10.14 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature and all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not embraced in this code shall remain in full force and
effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.15 EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES.
   All ordinances passed by the legislative body requiring publication shall
take effect from and after the due publication thereof, unless otherwise
expressly provided. Ordinances not requiring publication shall take effect from
their passage, unless otherwise expressly provided.
§ 10.16 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF ORDINANCE.
   (A) Whenever any ordinance or part of an ordinance shall be repealed or
modified by a subsequent ordinance, the ordinance or part of an ordinance thus
repealed or modified shall continue in force until the due publication of the
ordinance repealing or modifying it when publication is required to give effect
thereto, unless otherwise expressly provided.
   (B) No suit, proceedings, right, fine, forfeiture, or penalty instituted,
created, given, secured, or accrued under any ordinance previous to its repeal
shall in anywise be affected, released, or discharged, but may be prosecuted,
enjoyed, and recovered as fully as if the ordinance had continued in force
unless it is otherwise expressly provided.
   (C) When any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause, or provision
shall be itself repealed, the repeal shall not be construed to revive the
former ordinance, clause, or provision, unless it is expressly provided.
§ 10.17 ORDINANCES WHICH AMEND OR SUPPLEMENT CODE.
   (A) If the legislative body shall desire to amend any existing chapter or
section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B) Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of such chapter or section. In addition to such
indication thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a
caption or title shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

§ 32.07 SERVICE RETIREMENT ANNUITY PROGRAM; OCCUPATIONAL DISABILITY PROGRAM.
   Pursuant to the provisions of Sections 64.202(f), 64.204, 64.405, 64.406,
and 64.410 of Subtitle G of Title 110B, V.T.C.S., as amended by the 70th
Legislature of the State of Texas, Regular Session, which Subtitle shall herein
be referred to as the "TMRS Act," the city adopts the following provisions
affecting participation of its employees in the Texas Municipal Retirement
System (which retirement system shall herein be referred to as the "System"):
   (A) Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to
retire and receive a service retirement annuity, if the member has at least 25
years of credited service in that system performed for one or more
municipalities that have participation dates after September 1, 1987, or have
adopted a like provision under Section 64.202(f) of the TMRS Act.
   (B) If a "vested member," as that term is defined in Section 64.204(b) of
the TMRS Act, shall die before becoming eligible for service retirement and
leaves surviving a lawful spouse whom the member has designated as beneficiary
entitled to payment of the member's accumulated contributions in event of the
member's death before retirement, the surviving spouse may by written notice
filed with the system elect to leave the accumulated deposits on deposit with
the system subject to the terms and conditions of said Section 64.2049(b). If
the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the
member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the
surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an
annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse
in such amount as would have been payable had the member lived and retired at
that date under a joint and survivor annuity (Option 1) payable during the
lifetime of the member and continuing thereafter during the lifetime of the
surviving spouse.
   (C) At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a
surviving spouse to whom division (B) applies may, upon written application
filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions
standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable
under this section. In the event such a surviving spouse shall die before
payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section,
the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be
paid to the estate of such spouse.
   (D) The rights, credits, and benefits hereinabove authorized shall be in
addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the
effective date of this section pursuant to the TMRS Act.
   (E) Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to
retire and receive a "standard occupational disability annuity" under Section
64.408 of the TMRS Act or an "optional occupational disability retirement
annuity" under Section 64.410 of the TMRS Act upon making application therefor
upon such form and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Board of Trustees
of the system, provided that the system's medical board has certified to said
Board of Trustees: (1) that the member is physically or mentally disabled for
further performance of the duties of the member's employment; (2) that the
disability is likely to be permanent; and (3) that the member should be
retired. Any annuity granted under this division (E) shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 64.409 of the TMRS Act.
   (F) The provisions relating to the occupational disability program as set
forth in division (E) above are in lieu of the disability program heretofore
provided for under Sections 64.301 to 64.308 of the TMRS Act.

credit for the period of such probationary service (not in excess of six
months), pursuant to the provisions of Section 63.303 of Subtitle G, Title

city business before the Commissioners.
   (A)   Preservation of Order. The Mayor shall preserve order and decorum,
prevent the impugning of member's motives and confine members to debate of the
questions under discussion.
   (B)   Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn may be made at any time upon
being recognized by the Mayor so long as no one has been previously recognized
and is speaking; such a motion requires a second and it requires a majority
vote to pass.
   (C)   Point of Order.
      (1)   A member of the Commissioners may raise a point of order at any
time whether or not another member of the City Commissioners is speaking. A
point of order is a statement to the Mayor that a particular motion before the
City Commissioners or other matter is out of order or to make an inquiry of the
Mayor as to parliamentary procedure or for information. As soon as a point of
order has been disposed of, the person interrupted may continue speaking.
      (2)   In the event that a member asserting a point of order is overruled
by the Mayor, he or she may appeal to the members of City Commissioners for a
final decision. The Mayor shall then briefly state the reasons for his decision
and the decision of the Mayor may be overruled by a majority vote of the
members of the City Commissioners.
   (D)   Suspension of the Rules. A member of the City Commissioners may move
to suspend the rules that interfere with a particular matter that is of
apparent importance to the Commissioners and should be considered by the
Commissioners immediately or out of order. In order for this to be
accomplished, it is necessary that a majority vote be obtained. However, a
motion to suspend the rules cannot interrupt an individual speaking.
   (E)   Motion to Withdraw a Motion. A person making the motion may move to
withdraw his or her motion, and it is withdrawn unless an objection is raised.
If a member of the City Commissioners objects to the withdrawal of the motion,
then the Mayor, upon motion from a member of the City Commissioners, may put
the matter to an immediate vote and if the majority of the members of the City
Commissioners vote to allow removal of the motion, it is withdrawn.
   (F)   Motion to Object to the Consideration of a Motion. A member of the
City Commissioners may object to the consideration of a motion, and such
objection may be made at any time, even when a member of the City Commissioners
is speaking. In order to stop the consideration of a motion, a majority vote of
the members of the City Commissioners present is required, which in no event
shall be less than four members of the City Commissioners.
   (G)   Tabling. In order to table a motion, a motion must be made and can
only be made at such time when another member of the City Commissioners is not
speaking; the matter must then be put to a vote by the Mayor and upon a vote of
a majority of the members of the City Commissioners, it may be tabled.
   (H)   Motion to Close Debate. A motion to close debate on a particular
matter before the Commissioners can only be made at such time as the person
making the motion is recognized by the Mayor and no one else is speaking. In
order to close debate, a majority is necessary.
   (I)   Motion to Postpone Consideration. A motion may be made to postpone
consideration of a pending motion. This must be made at a time when the Mayor
has recognized the mover and no one else is speaking. A vote of the majority of
the members of the City Commissioners will carry this motion.
   (J)   Amending a Motion. A motion may be amended by a member of the City
Commissioners stating that he wishes to amend. This motion is debatable and can
be passed by a majority vote of the members of the City Commissioners.
   (K)   Questions to Contain One Subject. All questions submitted for vote
shall contain only one subject. If two or more subjects are involved, any
member of the City Commissioners may require division.
   (L)   Order of Precedence of Motions. Robert's Rules of Order Revised shall
prevail as to the order of precedence of motions and types of motions.
   (M)   Right to Floor. Any member of the City Commissioners desiring to speak
shall be recognized by the Mayor and shall confine his remarks to the subject
under consideration. No member shall speak more than once to a question until
every member wishing to speak shall have spoken.
   (N)   Point of Order. The Mayor shall determine all points of order, subject
to the right of any member to appeal to the Commissioners or request a
parliamentary opinion of the City Attorney.
   (O)   Reconsideration by motion of an action of the commissioners can be
made no later than the next succeeding regular meeting. Such motion can only be
made by a member who voted with the majority. It can be seconded by any member.
No question shall be twice reconsidered, except by a majority vote of the
members of the City Commissioners, except that action relating to any contract
may be reconsidered at any time, before final execution thereof.
(Ord. 552, passed 6-16-97)
CODE OF CONDUCT
§ 36.85 CODE OF CONDUCT.
   The orderly conduct of the Commissioners in meetings and in public is
necessary for the good governance of the city and facilitates open dialogue
between Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners adopts the following as its
code of conduct:
   (A)   Arrive at meetings on time; silence all personal communication
devices, and do not allow them to distract from the work at hand.
   (B)   Listen and understand before drawing conclusions.
   (C)   Focus on city vision and goals.
   (D)   No personal attacks or inferences.
   (E)   Look for areas of agreement before differences.
   (F)   State your reservation, but support the Board of Commissioners'
decision once a decision is made.
   (G)   Agree to disagree; move on to the next issue.
   (H)   Come prepared to discuss issues.
   (I)   Ask questions of staff prior to the meeting so that Commissioners and
staff can be prepared.
   (J)   Understand that the City Manager is the primary link or the valid
chain of command authority that serves between the City Commissioners and the
professional staff. The City Commissioners' relationship with the staff shall
be through the City Manager. The City Commissioners shall refrain from giving
orders or direction to any subordinate of the City Manager, either publicly or
privately. The City Commissioners establish policy and laws for the city, and
the City Manager is the head of administration managing the established policy
and law.
   (K)   Praise in public; provide constructive feedback in private.
   (L)   Participate in discussions and focus on the issue; avoid side
conversations. Be mindful that sidebar conversations are disruptive.
   (M)   Show respect and courtesy and refrain from making disparaging comments
about fellow City Commissioners, the public, and city staff in the conduct of a
Board of Commissioners' meeting, outside of Commissioner meetings, in social
settings, and on social media.
   (N)   Communicate in an open, direct manner; keep others informed. Do not
present false claims or records.
   (O)   Discuss any problems you may have with another Commissioner directly
and not to other Commissioners, the community, or staff.
   (P)   Be a positive and ethical ambassador for the city. Refrain from any
activity or action that may hinder one's ability to be objective and impartial
on any matter coming before the Board of Commissioners.
   (Q)   Understand that the Mayor must first recognize you before speaking at
a Board of Commissioners' meeting.
   (R)   Allow others to finish their comments before speaking (subject to the
rules of parliamentary procedure and the Mayor's responsibility to preserve
order and decorum).
   (S)   Recognize that city policy decisions are ultimately the responsibility
of the Board of Commissioners collectively in public meetings. Work assignments
and policy direction should come from the elected body as a whole and not from
individual members. Do not dominate or misdirect the City Manager's time and
staff's time through allotment of insular, frivolous, or voluminous
assignments.
(Ord. 1010, passed 9-30-21)
§ 36.86 CENSORSHIP AND ENFORCEMENT.
   The following provisions may be used to enforce the code of conduct in §
36.85 and Commissioner adherence to other applicable city charter and ordinance
provisions pertaining to Commissioner conduct.

Commissioner, staff member, applicant, or other people in attendance:

a person who continues to violate these rules.

Commissioner may only be removed from a Board of Commissioners' meeting by an
affirmative vote of four members. Any person who refuses to vacate or further
disrupts the proceedings shall be removed by the Chief of Police or their
designated officer in attendance. No person may be removed from a meeting
merely due to their viewpoint or opinion.
   (B)   Extension of time. If a violation of these rules disrupts or
interferes with any commentary or presentation, the Mayor may, in their
discretion or upon motion of any Commissioner, seconded and approved by an
affirmative vote of four members, extend the speaker's time to compensate for
such disruption or interference.
   (C)   Temporary recess. If appropriate in providing for the good order and
decorum of the proceedings, the Mayor may, in their discretion or upon motion
of any Commissioner, seconded and approved by an affirmative vote of four
members, call a temporary recess of the proceedings.
   (D)   Notice. Criminal violation under state law. Any violation of these
rules that disrupts, obstructs, and/or interferes with a lawful public meeting
may subject the violator to prosecution under state law. See Tex. Penal Code §
42.05, as amended.
   (E)   Discipline of Commissioner. The Board of Commissioners may discipline
a Commissioner who violates this code of conduct, the charter, any other city
ordinance, city policy, or acts in a manner that causes embarrassment or
disgrace to the City of Burkburnett. No City Commissioner shall be disciplined
under this provision except in accordance with the procedures and authority set
forth herein.

another Commissioner for conduct in violation of these rules.
      (2)   Upon consideration of the item and motion of any Commissioner,
seconded and approved by an affirmative vote of four members, requesting an
item to consider discipline of a Commissioner for conduct in violation of these
rules, an item will be added to a subsequent Board of Commissioners meeting
agenda for discussion in closed executive session in accordance with §
36.34. The member subject to the agenda item shall be present at the executive
session to answer any questions asked by a Commissioner or make other
statements as he or she may desire to make in his or her defense. If the member
subject to the agenda item refuses to attend the executive session, the
remaining Commissioners may proceed in his or her absence.
      (3)   In open session, Board of Commissioners may, by motion of any
Commissioner, seconded and approved by an affirmative vote of four members,
discipline the offending Commissioner in any single or combination of options
as follows:
         (a)   No action. The Board of Commissioners decides to take no
disciplinary action.
         (b)   Denial of agenda items. The Board of Commissioners decides to

must be signed by the Mayor or the Mayor Pro Tem in the case of alleged
misconduct by the Mayor.

CHAPTER 51: NATURAL GAS
Section
   
51.01
   General service rate for sales of natural gas to  residential and commercial
consumers
§ 51.01 GENERAL SERVICE RATE FOR SALES OF NATURAL GAS TO RESIDENTIAL AND
COMMERCIAL CONSUMERS.
   (A) The maximum general service rate for sales of natural gas rendered to
residential and commercial consumers within the city limits, by the Lone Star
Gas Company, a division of Enserch Corporation, a Texas Corporation, its
successors and assigns, is hereby fixed and determined as set forth in division
(H)(1) of this section.
   (B) The residential and commercial rates set forth above shall be adjusted
upward or downward from a base of $4.0200 per Mcf by a gas cost adjustment
factor expressed as an amount per 1000 cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas for
changes in the intracompany city gate rate charge as authorized by the State
Railroad Commission or other regulatory body having jurisdiction for gas
delivered to the city distribution system, according to division (H)(2) of this
section.
   (C)   The residential and commercial rates set forth above shall be adjusted
upward or downward for changes in taxes and other governmental impositions,
rental fees or charges according to division (G)(4) of this section.
   (D) The company shall also receive weather normalization adjustments
according to division (H)(3) of this section.
   (E) In addition to the aforesaid rates, the company shall have the right to
collect such reasonable charges as are necessary to conduct its business and to
carry out its reasonable rules and regulations in effect. The charges set forth
in divisions (H)(5) and (6) of this section are approved. Services for which no
charge is set out may be performed and charged for by the company at a level
established by the normal forces of competition.
   (F) In addition to the aforesaid rates, the Company is authorized to recover
the current and any unrecovered prior rate case expense through a surcharge
designed for a six-month nominal recovery period. The surcharge per Mcf will be
calculated by dividing the rate case expense to be recovered by one-half of the
adjusted annual sales volume to residential and commercial customers. The
Company will provide monthly status reports to the city to account for the
collection of rate case expense.
   (G) The rates set forth in this section may be changed and amended by either
the city or the company in the manner provided by law. Service hereunder is
subject to the orders of regulatory bodies having jurisdiction, and to the
company's rules and regulations currently on file in the company's office.
   (H) Lone Star Gas Company tariffs and schedules.
      (1) Item A. Rates.
         (a)   Subject to applicable adjustments, the following rates are the
maximum applicable to residential and commercial consumers per meter per month
or for any part of a month for which gas service is available at the same
location.
            1. Residential:
             Customer charge      $7.0000
             All consumption @    4.9700 per Mcf
   If the service period is less than 28 days in a month the customer charge is
$.2857 times the number of days service. If the consumption contains a portion
of an Mcf, a pro rata portion of the per Mcf charge will be made.
            2. Commercial:
             Customer charge      $12.0000
             First 20 Mcf @       5.2700 per Mcf
             Next 30 Mcf @       4.9700 per Mcf
             Over 50 Mcf @       4.8200
   If the service period is less than 28 days in a month the customer charge is
$.5000 times the number of days service. If the consumption contains a portion
of an Mcf, a pro rata portion of the per Mcf charge will be made.
         (b)   Bills are due and payable when rendered and must be paid within
ten days from the monthly billing date.
         (c)   Residential off-peak sales discount: An off-peak sale discount
of $.25 per Mcf will apply to residential customer's volume purchased in excess
of 8 Mcf for each billing months May through October.
      (2) Item B. Gas cost adjustment.
         (a) Each monthly bill at the above rates shall be adjusted for gas
cost as follows:
            1. The city gate rate increase or decrease applicable to current
billing month residential and commercial sales shall be estimated to the
nearest $0.0001 per Mcf based upon:
               a. The city gate rate estimated to be applicable to volumes
purchased during the current calendar month, expressed to the nearest $0.0001
per Mcf (shown below as "Re") less
               b.    The base city gate rate of $4.0200 per Mcf, multiplied by
               c. A volume factor of 1.0204 determined in establishing the
above rates for the distribution system as the ratio of adjusted purchased
volumes divided by adjusted sales volumes.
            2. Correction of the estimated adjustment determined by division
(H)(2)(a)1. of this section shall be included as part of the adjustment. The
correcting factor (shown below as division (H)(2)(a)1.b. of this section) shall
be expressed to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf based upon:
               a. The corrected adjustment amount based upon the actual city
gate rate, less
               b. The estimated adjustment amount billed under division (H)(2)
(a)1. of this section, divided by
               c. Distribution system residential and commercial sales Mcf
recorded on the company's books during the prior year for the month that the
correction is included as part of the adjustment.
            3. The adjustment determined by division (H)(2)(a)1. and 2. of this
section shall be multiplied by a tax factor of 1.05232 to include street and
alley rental and state occupation tax due to the change in the company revenues
under this gas cost adjustment provision.
         (b) In summary, the gas cost adjustment (GCA) shall be determined to
the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf by division (H)(2)(a)1. through 3. of this section
as follows:
         GCA = [division (H)(2)(a)1. + division (H)(2)(a)2.] × division (H)(2)
(a)3. of this section.
         GCA = [(1.0204) (Re - $4.0200) + C] × 1.05232
      (3)   Item C.
         (a)   Weather normalization adjustment. Effective with bills rendered
during the October 1995 through May 1996 billing months, and annually
thereafter for the October through May billing months, the above residential
and commercial consumption rates for gas service, as adjusted, shall be subject
to a weather normalization adjustment each billing cycle to reflect the impact
of variations in the actual heating degree days during the period included in
the billing cycle from the normal level of heating degree days during the
period included in the billing cycle. The weather normalization adjustment will
be implemented on a per Mcf basis and will be applicable to the heating load of
each customer during the period included in the billing cycle. It will be
determined separately for residential and commercial customers based on heating
degree data recorded by the Wichita Falls weather station. The adjustment to be
made for each billing cycle will be calculated according to the following
formula:
 
WNA NDD - ADD × M × AHL
    ADD
 
      Where:   WNA =   Weather normalization adjustment
            NDD =   Normal heating degree days during the period covered by the
billing cycle
            ADD =      Actual heating degree days during the period covered by
the billing cycle
            M =      Weighted average margin per Mcf included in the commodity
portion of the rates effective during the October through May billing months
            AHL =   Actual heating load per customer
         (b)   The heating load to which the weather normalization adjustment
is to be applied for residential customers is determined by subtracting the
residential class base load from the total volume being billed to the customer.
The heating load to which the weather normalization adjustment is to be applied
for commercial customers is determined by subtracting the base load for the
customer from the total volume being billed to the customer. The base load of a
customer is the average level of nonheating consumption.
         (c)   The weather normalization adjustment is subject to a 50%
limitation factor based on temperatures being 50% warmer or colder than normal.
The weather normalization adjustment will be calculated to the nearest $.0001
per Mcf.
      (4) Item D. Tax adjustment. The tax adjustment shall be an amount
equivalent to the proportionate part of any new tax, or any tax increase or
decrease, or any increase or decrease of any other governmental imposition,
rental, fee or charge (except state, county, city and special district ad
valorem taxes and taxes on net income) levied, assessed, or imposed subsequent
to July 1, 1993, upon or allocable to the company's distribution operations, by
any new or amended law, ordinance, or contract.
      (5) Item E. Schedule of service charges.
         (a) Inauguration of service. In addition to the charges and rates set
out above, the company shall charge and collect the sum of:
   Schedule                        Charge
   8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday         $27.50
   5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. Monday through Friday         41.25
   Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays            41.25
For each reconnection of gas service, where service has been discontinued at
the same premises for any reason, and for each new inauguration of service when
the billable party has changed, with the following exceptions:
            1. For a builder who uses gas temporarily during construction or
for display purposes;
            2. For the first occupant of the premises;
            3. Whenever gas service has been temporarily interrupted because of
system outage, service work or appliance installation done by the company; or
            4.    For any reason deemed necessary for company operations.
         (b) Returned check charges. A returned check handling charge of $13.75
is made for each check returned to the company for reasons of nonsufficient
funds, account closed, payment withheld, invalid signature, or improper
preparation.
         (c) Collection charge. A charge of $7 shall be made for each instance
when it is necessary for a company employee to go to a customer's residence or
place of business in order to collect amounts owed the company for gas service
previously rendered. This charge shall not apply if service is terminated at
the time of the collection action. This charge shall apply to only one trip on
the same amount owed.
      (5) Item E. Main line extension rate. The charge for extending mains
beyond the free limit established by franchise, or any free limit established
by franchise, for bona fide residential customer shall be the lesser of: the
system-wide average cost of construction, including all overheads, for the
prior fiscal year; or the adjusted actual cost as determined by applying the
latest Handy-Whitman Index to the 1975 actual base cost of $2.94. A bona fide
residential customer uses gas for heating and water heating, or the equivalent
load thereof, at a minimum. Residential customers other than bona fide
residential customers shall pay actual cost for main line extensions beyond the
free limit. The company shall file the calculation of such charge with the city
as soon as sufficient data is available each fiscal year. Extension to
commercial and industrial customers shall be based on actual cost per foot.

and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and time, and
if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. The Control Authority may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
         (c)   Notification shall not relieve the discharger of any expense,
loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the POTW, fish fills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the discharger of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
      (3)   Liability due to accidental discharges of "slugloads". Any
discharger who discharges "slugloads" or prohibited materials shall be liable,
pursuant to §

shall be located on the discharger's premises; except, in the case where such
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the discharger, the
Control Authority may approve the placement of monitoring facilities in the
public street or sidewalk area. All monitoring equipment and facilities shall
be maintained in safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
discharger.
   (B)   Failure to provide proper monitoring facilities shall be grounds for
denial of a permit application.
(Ord. 338A, passed 5-5-92) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.41 INSPECTIONS AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The Control Authority may inspect the facilities of any discharger to
determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The discharger
shall allow the Control Authority or its representatives to enter upon the
premises of the discharger at all reasonable times, for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, or examination of records. Any employee, agent, or other
representative of the Control Authority who enters private property shall
observe the establishment's rules and regulations concerning safety, internal
security, and fire protection, and if the property has management in residence,
shall notify management or the person then in charge of his presence and shall
exhibit proper credentials. The Control Authority shall have the right to set
up on the discharger's property such devices as are reasonably necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, metering and/or measuring
operations.
   (B)   Any discharges of wastewater or other waste into the POTW shall be
subject to inspection and/or sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by
the Control Authority. Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be
representative of the character and concentration of the wastewater or waste
under operating conditions. The Control Authority shall provide the Discharger
with a split set of all discharge samples taken. The laboratory methods used in
the examination of said waste shall be Standard Methods and/or those set forth
in 40 CFR, Part 136. Regular inspections and/or sampling shall be conducted at
such times and on such schedules as may be established by the Control
Authority. Should a discharger desire that a scheduled inspection and/or
sampling be conducted at some time other than that scheduled by the Control
Authority, such inspection and/or sampling may be conducted by the Control
Authority at the expense of the discharger.
   (C)   Unscheduled inspections may be conducted whenever deemed by the
Control Authority to be reasonably necessary to ensure that the terms of this
chapter are complied with.
   (D)   The failure or refusal of a discharger to allow the access required by
this section shall be grounds for the disconnection of water and/or sewer
service to the discharger's facility, pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter applicable to enforcement and/or termination of service.
(Ord. 338A, passed 5-5-92) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.42 DETERMINATION OF FLOW.
   (A)   The water consumption during the previous month, as determined from
the meter records of the city water department, shall be the basis for
computing the sewage flow from any discharger, unless actual sewage flow is
measured by a recording meter of a type approved by the Control Authority. The
discharger shall install and maintain such recording meter in proper condition
to accurately measure such flow. Upon failure to do so, the water consumption
shall be the basis for computing the sewage flow.
   (B)   When water is contained in a product or is evaporated or is discharged
as unpolluted wastewater in an uncontaminated condition to surface drainage (in
compliance with this chapter and all state and federal law), an application may
be made for a reduction in the computed volume of waste discharged to the POTW,
provided supporting data satisfactory to the Control Authority is furnished.
Such data shall include a flow diagram and other indication of the destination
of water supply and/or wastewater, supported by data from meters installed on
such process piping at the expense of the discharger.
   (C)   Any discharger who procures any part or all of his water supply from a
source or sources other than the city, any of which is discharged into the
POTW, shall install and maintain at his expense an effluent meter and/or other
flow measuring device of a type approved by the Control Authority for the
purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer
flow. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly.

52.99
§ 52.43 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SIGNIFICANT DISCHARGERS/PERMITTEES.
   (A)   Baseline report. Within 90 days following the effective date for any
applicable categorical pretreatment standard or prior to commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new significant industrial
discharger, any significant industrial discharger subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard shall submit to the Control Authority a report,
indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons. The report from existing significant industrial dischargers shall
state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards and
pretreatment requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, what
additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into
compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards and
pretreatment requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the discharger, and certified by a qualified professional.
   (B)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance by a significant industrial discharger with an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard, or 90 days following commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new significant industrial
discharger, any significant industrial discharger subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard shall submit to the Control Authority a report indicating
the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances
contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons.
The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards and

subject to a categorical pretreatment standard or requested by the control
authority shall submit to the control authority, during the months of June and
December of each year, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
prohibited and regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the
pretreatment standards or requirements. In addition, this report shall include
a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which,
during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow specified in the
discharger's permit. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual
measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations
justify, the Control Authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques. The Control Authority, taking into
consideration such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the submission or said
reports on months other than those specified above.
   (D)   Reports of significant industrial dischargers shall contain all
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow rate, the
nature and concentration of the constituents, or the production and mass of the
constituents, where required by the Control Authority. The frequency of
monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard or in this chapter or more frequently as
specified by the Control Authority. Sampling shall be done in accordance with
Standard Methods and 40 CFR, Part 136.

provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be
subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2, as follows:
      (1)   A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering
part of all of the information, in a manner described below, and that
information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the
procedure set forth below.
      (2)   If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all
information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the
discharger.
   (B)   Method and time of asserting business confidentiality claim. A
discharger which is submitting information to the Control Authority may assert
a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on (or
attaching to) the information, at the time it is submitted to the Control
Authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend, or other suitable form of
notice employing language such as "trade secret," "proprietary," or "company
confidential." Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise nonconfidential
documents should be clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted
separately to facilitate identification and handling by the Control Authority.
If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or
until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state.

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 52.60 RATES AND CHARGES.
   Users of the City Sewer System shall be subject to the following rates
effective October 1, 2024:
   (A)   Residential User Charges.
      (1)   Residential user charges shall be calculated from the following
formula:
      Monthly user charge = Base rate + $2.53 (Average water consumption)
      Where:   Monthly user charge = the amount in dollars charged for basic
residential sewer services.
            Base rate = $14.94
            Average monthly water consumption = the average monthly water
consumption during the months of December, January and February measured in
1,000 gallon units.
      (2)   Whenever an average monthly water consumption has not yet been
established, a minimum charge of $29.47 per month shall be used.
   (B)   Commercial User Charges.
      (1)   "COMMERCIAL USER" is hereby defined for the purposes of this
section as anyone who uses water for purposes other than domestic use.
      (2)   Commercial user charges shall be calculated from the following
formula:
      Monthly user charge = Base rate + $2.88 (Monthly water consumption)
      Where:   Monthly user charge = the amount in dollars charged for basic
commercial sewer services.            Base rate: $14.94
            Monthly water consumption = the monthly water consumption measured
in 1,000 gallon units.
      (3)   Commercial user charges shall be calculated from the following: Any
commercial user who uses water as an ingredient in the manufacturing process of
a product shall not be required to pay a sewer charge based on the water so
incorporated into the product. Any such industrial user shall be required to
show proof, of the amount of water used as an ingredient in the manufacturing
process. The city reserves the right to conduct such tests as it may deem
necessary to determine the amount of wastewater placed into the sanitary sewer
by such user.
   (C)   The industrial wastewater surcharge is a reimbursement for costs
incurred by the city's wastewater treatment plant and sewer collection system
from the treatment of pollutants in excess of normal domestic sewage discharged
by industrial uses. Assessment of surcharges does not alleviate the industrial
user of the responsibility to comply with pretreatment requirements. Consistent
non-compliance by an industrial user will result in enforcement actions as
defined by this section.
      (1)   Surcharges for excess Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total
Suspended Solids (TSS) BOD and TSS surcharges shall be calculated as follows:
Formulas:   Surcharge for TSS = S x (S1 - Sd) x 8.34 x F
      Surcharges for BOD = B x (B1 - Bd) x 8.34 x F
S   = unit cost of treating ($/lb)
S1    = TSS concentration in sample (mg/L)
B    = unit cost of treating BOD ($/lb)
B1    = BOD concentration sample (mg/L)
Bd    = BOD plant design criteria for normal domestic sewage
     = 200 mg/L (Base value from which the surcharge is calculated)
Sd    = TSS plant design criteria for normal domestic sewage
      = 200 mg/L (Base value from which the surcharge is calculated)
F    = Discharged flow measured in millions of gallons per day (MGD) or
millions of gallons (MG)
8.34 = equivalent mass of one gallon of water measured in pounds (8.34 lbs/gal)
      (2)   Current Unit Cost of Treatment for TSS is $.10 per pound; and $.08
per pounds. These values are based on an annual flow of 478.15 million gallons,
1.533 million pounds BOD, 620 thousand pounds TSS, at an annual O&M cost of
$365,885.00.
      (3)   Annual Adjustment of Unit Costs. The unit costs of treating TSS(S)
and BOD(B) shall be adjusted annually to reflect increases or decreases in
wastewater treatment costs based on the previous year's experience as presented
in the annual Auditor's Report. In the event that major changes in the
industrial base have taken place prior to the annual review, the city may
adjust the Unit Cost Rates based on current operational data and expenditures.
         (a)   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall determine the Unit Cost of
treatment of BOD and TSS based on the following criteria:
Total volume of treated wastewater for fiscal year
Total mass of BOD treated for fiscal year
Total mass of TSS treated for fiscal year
Total operation and maintenance expenditures for fiscal year based on auditor's
report
         (b)   The following assumptions shall be used to determine the
percentage of operation and maintenance costs associated with treatment of
FLOW, BOD and TSS:
FLOW: 50% of O&M expenditures
BOD: 33% of O&M expenditures
TSS: 17% of O&M expenditures
         (c)   The following formulas shall be applied in determining the unit
cost of treatment:
B - 33% C
BT
S - 17% C
ST
Where:
B   = Unit cost of treatment for BOD measured in dollars per pound ($/lb)
C   = Total O&M of BOD expenditures for fiscal year from auditor's report
BT   = Total mass of BOD during fiscal year measured in pounds (lbs)
S   = Unit cost of treatment for TSS measured in dollars per pound ($/lb)
ST = Total mass of TSS treated during fiscal year measured in pounds (lbs)
         (d)   The calculated Unit Cost Rate shall be rounded to the nearest
whole cent. (Example: $0.0785 shall be rounded to $0.08)
         (e)   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall submit the unit cost rate
adjustments to the city and unit cost rates shall become effective 30 days
following approval by the city.
      (4)   Surcharges may be assessed on a daily basis providing the
industrial user's wastewater discharge is measured by a totalizing flow meter.
BOD and TSS surcharges may be assessed using the arithmetic monthly average of
the daily concentrations for each pollutant respectively and the total flow
discharged for the month.
   (D)   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall prepare surcharge assessments for
all industrial users on a monthly basis and shall submit the assessment to the
City Water Billing Department. The discharger shall pay monthly in accordance
with practices existing for payment of sewer charges.
   (E)   The city reserves the right to assess surcharges for excess costs of
treatment for other pollutants not specified in this section.

   If a discharger's payment of its monthly bills for water and sewer services,
including any industrial waste charges, is more than 60 days overdue, the
Control Authority may disconnect all connections to the water and sanitary
sewer mains to the city. The same penalties and charges now or hereafter
provided for by the ordinances of the city for failure to pay the bill for
water service when due shall be applicable in a like manner in case of failure
to pay the established charge for waste discharged to the sanitary sewer mains
as established in §
52.60.

§ 52.64 RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The Control Authority reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide
for more or less stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in Section
338A-12 of this chapter.
(Ord. 338A, passed 5-5-92)
§ 52.65 SEWER SERVICE FEE REQUIRED TO BE PAID; REIMBURSEMENT LIMIT.
   (A)   In 1961 the City Council determined that every resident that has city
sewer available will be required to pay the fee for sewer service. Due to
discrepancies in how billing was done in 1961 versus how bills are figured
presently; to clarify this situation, the City Council decrees if sewer service
is available, whether or not the residence is hooked on to sewer, shall pay the
same as if they were connected to the city sewer.
   (B)   It was determined by the City Council in 1961 that it would be the
responsibility of the residence for knowing if they are hooked on or not to the
city sewer.
   (C)   If any residence has been paying for sewer service and determines that
sewer service was not available to the residence, then the city shall set a two
year reimbursement to funds as a limit of repayment.

   (C)   Notification of violation; administrative adjustment. Whenever the
Control Authority finds that any discharger had violated or is violating this
chapter or its discharge permit, the Control Authority may serve or cause to be
served upon such discharger a written notice, either by personal delivery or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of
the alleged violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, the discharger
shall respond in person or in writing to the Control Authority, stating its
position with respect to the notice of violation. Thereafter, the parties shall
meet to discuss the occurrence of the violation or violations alleged and,
where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (D)   Show cause hearing. Where any violation of permit or this chapter is
not corrected by means of administrative adjustment as described in division
(C) above, the Control Authority may order any violating discharger to show
cause, before the Control Authority or its duly authorized representative, why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A written notice shall be
served on the discharger by personal service, certified or registered, return
receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
Control Authority or its designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the
enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and
directing the discharger to show cause before the authority or its designee why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served no less than ten days before the hearing. Service may be made

as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. A transcript
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing
upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
   (E)   Action following show cause hearing. After the Control Authority has
reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the discharger responsible for
any violation found to have been committed, directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been
installed or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are
necessary and appropriate may be issued, including revocation or suspension of
any discharge permit.
   (F)   Right to appeal. Following the entry of the order by the Control
Authority with respect to the conduct of a discharger, the discharger may file
an appeal in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction challenging the
Control Authority's order.

§ 52.76 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE AND/OR DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (A)   The Control Authority may suspend the wastewater treatment service
and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the
opinion of the Control Authority, in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to
the POTW, or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit.
Also, the Control Authority may suspend wastewater treatment service and/or a
wastewater discharge permit whenever acids and chemicals damaging the sewer
lines or treatment processes are released to the sewer causing rapid
deterioration of such structures or interfering with proper treatment of
sewage.
   (B)   Any discharger notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or its wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the offending discharge. In the event of a failure of the discharger
to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Control Authority shall
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate disconnection of the
discharger's sewer and/or water service connection, to prevent of minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals or the
environment.
   (C)   In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the Control
Authority shall make reasonable attempts to notify the discharger or user of
the premises where such offending discharge is generated before disconnecting
the water or sewer service line. The party whose service has been disconnected
shall have an opportunity for a hearing on the issue of the offending discharge
and the disconnection as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken
place.
   (D)   The Control Authority shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit
and/or the wastewater treatment and/or water service upon proof of the
elimination of the offending discharge. A detailed written statement by the
discharger describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Control
Authority within 15 days of the date of the occurrence. The city water and/or
wastewater service shall be reconnected only at the discharger's expense.

discharge.
(Ord. 338A, passed 5-5-92)
§ 52.79 UPSETS.
   (A)   Any discharger which experiences an upset in operations which places
the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter shall
inform the Control Authority thereof orally as soon as practicable but not
later than within 24 hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset.
A written report shall also be filed by the discharger with the Control

      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof, and the upset's impact
on a discharger's compliance status;
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur; and
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other condition of noncompliance.
   (B)   The Control Authority may waive the written report on a case- by-case
basis if an oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to any enforcement action
brought by the Control Authority against a discharger for any noncompliance
with this chapter occurring during the period of the upset if the discharger
demonstrates, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and that the discharger can identify the causes
of the upset;
      (2)   The discharging facility was at the time being properly operated;

prevent any discharge in violation of its permit or this chapter which had a
reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment.
   (D)   In any enforcement action, any discharger seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.
(Ord. 338A, passed 5-5-92) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.80 VARIANCES.
   A discharger may apply to the city for a variance from any discharge
limitation specified in §
52.21(B). The city may grant such a variance if the discharge limitation does
not prevent and is not designed to prevent: pass through; interference; a
violation of the discharger's categorical pretreatment standards; any adverse
damage to the health and safety of personnel maintaining and operating the
POTW; or any exceedance of the criteria for water quality developed by EPA
pursuant to section 304 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1314.

   ON-SITE SEWAGE DISPOSAL
§ 52.85 ON-SITE SEWAGE FACILITY REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   The city clearly understands that there are technical criteria, legal
requirements, and administrative procedures and duties associated with
regulating on-site sewage facilities, and will fully enforce Chapter 366 of the
Tex. Health and Safety Code and Chapters 7 and 37 of the Tex. Water Code, and
associated rules referenced in §
52.88.
(Ord. 944, passed - - )
§ 52.86 AREA OF JURISDICTION.
   The rules shall apply to all the area lying within the incorporated limits
of the city.
(Ord. 944, passed - - )
§ 52.87 ON-SITE SEWAGE FACILITY RULES.
   Any permit issued for an on-site sewage facility within the jurisdictional
area of the city must comply with the rules adopted in §
52.88.
(Ord. 944, passed - - )
§ 52.88 ON-SITE SEWAGE FACILITY RULES ADOPTED.
   The rules, Title 30 Tex. Administrative Code, Chapter 30, Subchapters A and
G, and Chapter 285, promulgated by the TCEQ for on-site sewage facilities are
hereby adopted, and all officials and employees of the city having duties under
said rules are authorized to perform such duties as are required of them under
said rules.
(Ord. 944, passed - - )
§ 52.89 INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE.
   The rules, 30 Tex. Administrative Code, Chapter 30, Subchapters A and G, and
Chapter 285 and all future amendments and revisions thereto are incorporated by

(Ord. 944, passed - - )
§ 52.90 AMENDMENTS.
   The city wishing to adopt more stringent rules for its OSSF Ordinance
understands that the more stringent local rule shall take precedence over the
corresponding TCEQ requirement. Listed below are the more stringent rules
adopted by the city:
   (A)   A permit shall be required for all on-site sewage facilities (OSSF)
regardless of acreage, and so the exception found in 30 Tex. Administrative
Code § 285.3(f)(2) shall not apply in the city limits.
   (B)   Permits shall not transfer automatically to a new owner upon sale or
other legal transfer of an OSSF, and so 30 Tex. Administrative Code § 285.3(a)
(3) shall not apply in the city limits. Within 60 days prior to the sale or
transfer of any property on which a permitted OSSF exists, the seller or
transferor must pay an inspection fee as established by the regulatory
authority and have an inspection of the OSSF performed by a licensed designated
representative of the health district. Only after the payment of such a fee and
the conduction of an inspection in which the OSSF is found to be compliant,
does the permit become transferable upon any sale or legal transfer which
occurs within 60 days of the inspection. OSSFs for properties which transfer
without the required fee and inspection shall be deemed to be invalid, and the
new owner, buyer or transferor must pay the required fee and obtain the
inspection before operating the OSSF.
   (C)   Within 60 days prior to the sale or transfer of any property on which
any OSSF, including an OSSF exempt from permitting requirements by 30 Tex.
Administrative Code § 285.3(f), exists, the seller or transferor must pay an
inspection fee as established by the regulatory authority and have an
inspection of the OSSF performed by a licensed designated representative of the
health district. Only after the payment of such a fee and the conduction of an
inspection in which the OSSF is found to be compliant, does the use of the
system become transferable upon any sale or legal transfer which occurs within
60 days of the inspection. OSSFs for properties which transfer without the
required fee and inspection shall be deemed to be invalid, and the new owner,
buyer or transferor must pay the required fee and obtain the inspection before
operating the OSSF.
   (D)   The Aerobic treatment unit sizing chart in Table II of 30 Tex.
Administrative Code § 285.91(2) is replaced with the following:
Size of Home Minimum Aerobic Tank Treatment Capacity in gallons per day

maintenance course approved by the regulatory authority for aerobic treatment
units and the property to be maintained is owned by the trained home owner;
         (b)   Holds a valid wastewater Class D license or higher wastewater
treatment license;
         (c)   Shows the OSSF was lawfully installed as of October 1, 2009, and
has maintained said OSSF prior to that date may continue to do so; or
         (d)   Demonstration from all of the above mentioned, must be able to
illustrate to a licensed designated representative of the health district that
he can perform the following procedures for maintaining the OSSF: replacing air
filters, cleaning aerobic diffusers, spinners and agitators, cleaning pumps,
testing for chlorine and/or fecal coliform, monitoring turbidity, scum and
sludge build-up, controlling odor, and ensuring the application area is
distributing properly and according to the original system design. The owner
must inspect the OSSF and submit an inspection report to the health district
every four months. An owner who fails to submit inspections as required shall
not be permitted to self-maintain, and will be required to obtain a testing and
reporting contract from a licensed OSSF maintenance provider.
      (2)   Each maintenance provider having contracts in Burkburnett shall
register with Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District (health
district) Environmental Health Division. Maintenance provider registration
shall be effective from the date of registration to December 31 of the same
year. Renewal maintenance provider registration for the next year shall not be
accepted before December 1 of the current year. New and renewal maintenance
contracts will only be accepted from maintenance providers whose registration
is current and in good standing. Maintenance provider registration shall be
free of charge.
         (a)   Maintenance providers who fail to perform maintenance testing at
the required intervals, mark an inspection tag, or submit a report on time two
or more times during any 12-month period may have their registration suspended
for no longer than one year in addition to any other penalties that may apply.
No new or renewal maintenance contracts will be accepted from a maintenance
provider during the time their registration is suspended.
         (b)   A licensed OSSF maintenance provider will submit an inspection
report for each OSSF to the health district every four months. Renewal
contracts shall be for a term of no less than one year and include at least
three inspections. Contract renewals with the same maintenance provider will
not be accepted by the health district unless all of the maintenance reports
from the previous contract period have been received.
   (H)   All components that need to be replaced on an OSSF shall be replaced
by an individual licensed by the TCEQ to replace or repair the specific
component. Said replacement must utilize components certified by the
manufacturer for use on the specific model being maintained.

with these rules and regulations.
   (B)   A "QUALIFIED NON-CITY USER" shall mean:
      (1)   Any person or firm presently purchasing water from the city or that
desires to purchase water from the city; and
      (2)   That is located outside of the territorial limits of the city but
within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, as such territorial
jurisdiction presently exists or as it may be expanded by operation of law or
amendment of the statute relating to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of
municipalities; and
      (3)   That installs and maintains an approved water line, which taps onto
an approved water main (as those terms are defined in these rules), and a city
water meter.
(Ord. 652, passed 1-20-03)
§ 53.51 WATER RATES AND CHARGES (OUT OF CITY WATER SALES).
   (A)   Water rates. A qualified non-city user shall pay the city for the
water metered through the user's water meter. The amount to be paid by a
qualified non-city user is stated in § 53.20(B) of this code.

size of which are to be approved by the city as provided in these regulations)
and any loss or usage will be paid by such user (no leak adjustments will be
made).

main shall pay the fee schedule set forth in
Chapter 55 of this code.

   (F)   Findings. The city finds that the foregoing rates and charges are fair
and reasonable, represent a fair return on the investment of the city in the
assets it uses to acquire, treat and distribute potable water taking into
account the burden placed on the city's overall water system in supplying such
out of city users and the absence of offsetting revenues from qualified non-
city users (such as ad valorem tax revenue).

water line with these regulations and, if the water line is to serve any
structure other than a residence, to determine the volume of usage.
(Ord. 652, passed 1-20-03)
§ 53.53 USAGE RULES.
   (A)   High volume usage. Water will not be sold or distributed to any person
or firm outside of the city limits for any high volume use such as livestock
watering or industrial or manufacturing uses unless the City Manager or his/her
designee gives a specific waiver of this requirement. The City Manager or his/
her designee may develop rules or criteria to determine what is a high volume
use.

(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
§ 54.02 ESTABLISHED.
   The city does hereby declare under the state constitution and §§ 552.041
through 552.054 TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE (the "Municipal Drainage Utility Systems
Act") as such act is adopted and amended, from time to time, that the drainage
system of the city shall be a public utility. Pursuant to the provisions of
TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE § 552.046, the city incorporates its existing drainage
facilities, materials, and supplies into the system.
(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
§ 54.03 ADOPTION OF SYSTEM.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners of the city finds that the city shall
establish a schedule of charges against all eligible real property in the
proposed service area.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners of the city finds that the city will
provide drainage for all eligible real property in the service area subject to
charges under Chapter 552 of the TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE upon payment of drainage
charges, unless exempted in this chapter.
   (C)   The Board of Commissioners of the city finds that the city will offer
drainage service on nondiscriminatory, reasonable and equitable terms.
(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
§ 54.04 SCHEDULE OF CHARGES.
   (A)   The schedule of charges under this chapter is based on studies, staff
review, and the projects and work program approved by the Board of
Commissioners. Future revisions will be made only after a separate hearing has
been held with notices properly published.
   (B)   The schedule of charges is based on a methodology that is
nondiscriminatory, reasonable, and equitable. The properties are established as
a class unless individual calculation is believed to be necessary. The source
of the impervious area data is the city and the stormwater runoff factors are
based on engineering quantifications. The fee for all properties is computed
using the same formula, which places all properties on the basis of a single-
family living unit equivalent (SFLUE).
      (1)   A SFLUE is defined as the impervious area of an average residential
lot which is 3,500 square feet.
      (2)   The minimum monthly drainage utility system fee for a
nonresidential piece of property is four dollars. An additional $4 fee will be
charged for each additional SFLUE. Each SFLUE is treated as a whole. If a
nonresidential piece of property has impervious cover greater than 3,500 square
feet but less than 7,000 square feet, the fee will be $8 per month.
      (3)   Applied to a nonresidential piece of property with an impervious
area of 31,600 square feet, the drainage utility system fee would be $40,
computed as follows: 31,600 square feet impervious; 31,600 square feet of
impervious area divided by 3,500 square feet of impervious area per SFLUE; =
ten SFLUEs times four dollars per SFLUE; = $40 per month.
      (4)   The fee schedule is applied with the following results:
         (a)   For single-family residential, condominiums and townhome
classifications: four dollars per month per utility customer.
         (b)   For nonresidential: The fee will be based on the impervious land
area of the property as determined by the city if the water service is provided
through master meters. In the case of multiple master meters, the sum of the
drainage charges for the entire property may be placed on the same utility
bill.
   (C)   All-weather surfaces: The drainage utility service fee for any portion
of a lot which consists of an all-weather surface shall be computed at one-half
of the rate that would be applicable to an impervious surface area. For
purposes of this section an "ALL-WEATHER SURFACE" shall mean a surface used for
pedestrian or vehicle traffic or vehicle or equipment storage or parking which
is not paved with concrete, asphalt or other paving material determined by the
city to be impervious.

§ 54.05 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following categories of utility customers shall be exempt from this
chapter and the charges hereby imposed:
   (A)   A lot or tract which is owned by one or more of the following
governmental entities: the State of Texas, Wichita County or the Burkburnett
Independent School District.
   (B)   Property which is required to be exempted from this chapter pursuant
to § 552.053(c) TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE, as amended.
(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
§ 54.06 BILLING, DEPOSITS AND EXPENDITURES.
   (A)   The city will bill for drainage services on the monthly utility bill
along with water, sewer and solid waste services.
   (B)   There will be no separate deposit required by utility customers.
   (C)   In the case of a delinquent payment of the monthly utility bill, which
includes the drainage charge, the city is authorized by § 552.050 TEX. LOC.
GOVT. CODE and by this chapter to discontinue service of all city utilities for
nonpayment, even if the amount in dispute is the drainage charge component of
the monthly utility bill.
   (D)   The city shall identify and separate all drainage utility income.
   (E)   The monies received from utility drainage charges shall be used only
for purposes that are directly or indirectly related to the utility drainage
system, as provided by law, including those costs of service defined in §
54.01 above.
(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
§ 54.07 APPEALS.
   (A)   Disputes regarding the administration of drainage system shall be
determined, in the first instance, by the city's Public Works Director. Any
person disputing the decision of the Public Works Director may appeal the
decision of the Public Works Director to the City Manager by compliance with
the following procedures:
      (1)   The disputing party must deliver a written notice of appeal to the
City Manager and the Public Works Director within ten days of the date of the
decision by the Public Works Director. The notice must specify the decision
appealed from and the reason the disputing party believes the decision is
incorrect. The city may develop forms for use in such appeals and, if such
forms have been developed, then the disputing party must use those forms in
prosecuting their appeal.
      (2)   The City Manager shall sustain the decision of the Public Works
Director if there is substantial evidence to support the
decision. The City Manager may reverse or modify the decision of the Public
Works Director if the City Manager determines:
         (a)   That the decision of the Public Works Director does not comply
with this chapter or the Municipal Drainage Utility Systems Act, as amended; or
         (b)   That an error was made with regard to the category of land
development, the area of imperviousness of the land development or the size of
the developed property; or
         (c)   That the property is unimproved and therefore not subject to the
stormwater drainage utility system fee.
   (B)   The City Manager shall render a written decision on such appeals
within 30 days after receiving a written notice of appeal from the land owner.
All such decisions by the City Manager shall be final.

for an additional reasonable period of time by the Chief of Police with the
concurrence of the City Manager upon the recommendation of the Wichita County
Health Department.
   (F)   Animals Bitten During City-wide Quarantine. During any city- wide
rabies quarantine every animal bitten (and thereby exposed to rabies) by an
animal which has been or is determined to have rabies, shall be destroyed or
the person in possession of the exposed animal may elect the following
procedure at such person's sole expense as an alternative to the destruction of
the bitten animal:
      (1)   If the exposed animal was currently vaccinated against rabies at
the time of the exposure, it must be:
         (a)   Vaccinated against rabies immediately; and
         (b)   Placed in strict isolation for forty-five (45) days.
      (2)   If the exposed animal was unvaccinated against rabies at the time
of the exposure, it must be treated as follows:
         (a)   Vaccinated against rabies immediately after the exposure;
         (b)   Given a second rabies vaccination three weeks after the
exposure;
         (c)   Given a third rabies vaccination eight weeks after the exposure;
and
         (d)   Placed in a strict isolation for ninety (90) days.
      (3)   The circumstances of the exposed animal's isolation must be
approved by the animal control officer.
   (G)   Destruction of Animals Prohibited. A person commits an offense if the
person: (i) kills, or causes to be killed, any rabid animal, any animal

required to be placed in quarantine: (i) currently vaccinated guide dogs in
service and (ii) currently vaccinated police dogs that inflict a bite while in

representative is hereby designated as the local rabies control authority
pursuant to Chapter 826 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.
   (K)   Construction with State Law. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to limit the authority of the animal control officer to carry out or
enforce the provisions of Chapter 826 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, the
rules of the Texas Board of Health pertaining to rabies and the rules adopted
by the Texas Board of Health under the area rabies quarantine provisions of
Section 826.045 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.
   (L)   Seizure Warrant. If a person who is in possession of an animal which
is subject to quarantine, testing or destruction under this §
91.60 fails or refuses to release the animal to the animal control officer for
quarantine; the animal control officer may apply to a magistrate for a seizure
warrant authorizing seizure of such animal for the purpose of quarantine,
testing or destruction in accordance with this section.
(Ord. 562, passed 9-21-98)
§ 91.61 WILD ANIMALS PROHIBITED.

(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.31 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
   Construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be

underground, the grantee shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate,
and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities, or any part
thereof, aerially or underground. Nothing contained in this section shall
require the grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-
mounted appurtenances such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive
devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies,

contained in this section, in the event that all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective
date of this chapter, the grantee shall only be required to construct, operate,
and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if
it is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities at

§ 92.33 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
   The cable system, as constructed as of the date of the passage and final
adoption of this chapter, substantially complies with the material provisions
hereof. The grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable system as
necessary, as desirable, or as required pursuant to the terms hereof within the
service area. Whenever the grantee shall receive a request for service from at
least 15 subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable
mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its cable system to
such subscribers at no cost to the subscribers for system extension, other than
the usual connection fees for all subscribers; provided that such extension is
technically feasible, and if it will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition, or market development of the cable system, or as provided
for under §
92.34.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.34 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
   No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual
circumstances, such as a subscriber's request to locate his cable drop
underground, existence of more than 150 feet of distance from distribution
cable to connection of service to subscribers, or a density of less than 15
subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable,
cable service or other service may be made available on the basis of a capital
contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and
easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in
aid of construction to be borne by grantee and subscribers in the area in which
cable service may be expanded, the grantee will contribute an amount equal to
the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers per 1,320 cable-
bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator
equals 15 subscribers. Potential subscribers will bear the remainder of the
construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The grantee may require that
the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such
potential subscribers be paid in advance.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.35 SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDING.
   The grantee shall provide without charge one outlet of basic service to the
franchising authority's office building(s), fire station(s), police station(s),
and public school building(s) that are passed by the grantee's cable system.
The outlets of basic service shall not be used to distribute or sell cable
services in or throughout such buildings; nor shall such outlets be located in
common or public areas open to the public. Users of such outlets shall hold the
grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use
of such outlets, including but not limited to, those arising from copyright
liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section,
the grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where
the drop line from the feeder cable to said buildings or premises exceeds 150
cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and so long as it will not
adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of
the cable system to do so, or unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees
to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 cable feet. In
the event that additional outlets of basic service are provided to such
buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees associated
therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials. Upon request of
the grantee, the building owner may also be required to pay the service fees
associated with the provision of basic service and the additional outlets
relating thereto.

REGULATION
§ 92.45 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   The grantee shall pay to the franchising authority a franchise fee
equal to 5% of gross revenues received by the grantee from the operations of
the cable system on an annual basis; provided, however, that the grantee may
credit against any such payments:
      (1)   Any tax, fee, or assessment of any kind imposed by franchising
authority or other governmental entity on a cable operator, or subscriber, or
both, solely because of their status as such; and
      (2)   Tax, fee or assessment of general applicability which is unduly
discriminatory against cable operators or subscribers (including any such tax,
fee, or assessment imposed, both on utilities and cable operators and their
services).
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, the 12-month period applicable under
the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar
year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the franchising authority and
grantee. The franchise fee payment shall be due and payable 90 days after the
close of the preceding calendar year. Each payment shall be accompanied by a
brief report from a representative of the grantee showing the basis for the
computation.
   (C)   In the event the maximum allowable franchise fee is increased by law,
the franchise authority may request an increase up to an amount equal to the
maximum allowed by law. However, prior to the grantee having the obligation to
pay that fee, the grantee must be notified in writing 90 days prior to that
obligation occurring. The grantee has the right to pass through to the
subscriber the franchise fee.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.46 LIMITATION ON FRANCHISE FEE ACTIONS.
   The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder
shall be five years from the date on which payment by the grantee is due.
Unless within five years from and after said payment due date the franchising
authority initiates a lawsuit for recovery of such franchise fees in a court of
competent jurisdiction, such recovery shall be barred and the franchising
authority shall be estopped from asserting any claims whatsoever against the
grantee relating to any such alleged deficiencies.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.47 RATES AND CHARGES.
   The franchising authority may not regulate the rates for the provision of
cable service and other services, including, but not limited to, ancillary
charges relating thereto, except as expressly provided herein and except as
authorized pursuant to federal and state law including, but not limited to, the
Cable Act and FCC Rules and Regulations relating thereto. From time to time,
and at any time, the grantee has the right to modify its rates and charges
including, but not limited to, the implementation of additional charges and
rates; provided, however, that the grantee shall give notice to the franchising
authority of any such modifications or additional charges 30 days prior to the
effective date thereof.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.48 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   The franchising authority and the grantee agree that any proceedings
undertaken by the franchising authority that relate to the renewal of the
grantee's franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of
Section 626 of the Cable Act (as such existed as of the effective date of the
Cable Act), unless the procedures and substantive protections set forth therein
shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any
subsequent provision of federal or state law.
   (B)   In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626(a), the
franchising authority agrees to notify the grantee of its preliminary
assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs and
interests, as well as, the past performance of the grantee under the then
current franchise term. The franchising authority further agrees that such a
preliminary assessment shall be provided to the grantee prior to the time that
the four month period referred to in Subsection (c) of Section 626 is
considered to begin. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
section, the grantee and franchising authority agree that at any time during
the term of the then current franchise, while affording the public appropriate
notice and opportunity to comment, the franchising authority and grantee may
agree to undertake and finalize negotiations regarding renewal of the then
current franchise and the franchising authority may grant a renewal thereof.
The grantee and the franchising authority consider the terms set forth in this
section to be consistent with the express provisions of Section 626 of the
Cable Act.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.49 CONDITIONS OF SALE.
   (A)   Except to the extent expressly required by federal or state law, if a
renewal or extension of the grantee's franchise is denied or the franchise is
lawfully terminated, and the franchising authority either lawfully acquires
ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of
ownership of or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the
cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a
fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a
going concern.
   (B)   The grantee and franchising authority agree that in the case of a
lawful revocation of the franchise, at the grantee's request, which shall be
made in its sole discretion, the grantee shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third
party. The franchising authority further agrees that during such a period of
time, it shall authorize the grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the
terms of its prior franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization
exceed a period of time greater than six months from the effective date of such
revocation. If, at the end of that time, the grantee is unsuccessful in
procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is
reasonably acceptable to the franchising authority, the grantee and franchising
authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal
or state law; it being further agreed that the grantee's continued operation of
its cable system during the six month period shall not be deemed to be a
waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the franchising
authority or the grantee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this section, neither the franchising authority nor the grantee shall be
required to violate federal or state law.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.50 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
   The grantee's right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate,
without the prior consent of the franchising authority, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a
transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any
rights, title, or interest of the grantee in the franchise or cable system in
order to secure indebtedness.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING
§ 92.55 TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE.
   The grantee shall comply with FCC mandated rules and regulations regarding
technical and customer service standards. The franchising authority may perform
technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner
which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of
the grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or not the
grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable state or federal
laws. Except in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only
after giving the grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two
business days, and providing a representative of the grantee an opportunity to
be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that
the grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement
hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the grantee. In
the event that such testing demonstrates that the grantee has substantially
complied with such material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall
be borne by the franchising authority. Except in emergency circumstances, the
franchising authority agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no more than
two times a year in the aggregate, and that the results thereof shall be made
available to the grantee upon the grantee's request.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.56 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   The grantee agrees that the franchising authority may review such of its
books and records, during normal business hours and on a nondisruptive basis,
as is reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with the terms hereof. Such
records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public records required
to be kept by the grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the grantee shall
not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature. The franchising authority agrees to
treat any information disclosed by the grantee to it as confidential and only
to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a
need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
INSURANCE
§ 92.65 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   The grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and
expense, during the term of the franchise, Comprehensive General Liability
Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury,
and property damage. Said insurance shall designate the franchising authority
as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon 30
days prior written notice to the franchising authority.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.66 INDEMNIFICATION.
   The grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the
franchising authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any
liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property
damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the
grantee's construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.67 BONDS AND OTHER SURETY.
   Except as expressly provided herein, the grantee shall not be required to
obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the
franchise or continuing its existence. The franchising authority acknowledges
that the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the grantee are
sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of the franchise and the
enforcement thereof. The grantee and franchising authority recognize that the
costs associated with bonds and other surety may ultimately be borne by the
subscribers in the form of increased rates for cable services. In order to
minimize such costs, the franchising authority agrees to require bonds and
other surety only in such amounts and during such times as there is a
reasonably demonstrated need therefor. The franchising authority agrees that in
no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in an
aggregate amount greater than $10,000, conditioned upon the substantial
performance of the material terms, covenants, and conditions of the franchise.
Initially, no bond or other surety will be required. In the event that one is
required in the future, the franchising authority agrees to give the grantee at
least 60 days prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the
requirement. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the grantee's legal,
financial, or technical qualifications which would materially prohibit or
impair its ability to comply with the terms of the franchise or afford
compliance therewith.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
ENFORCEMENT
§ 92.75 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   In the event that the franchising authority believes that the grantee has
not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the grantee in
writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.76 GRANTEE'S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND.
   The grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in §
92.75:
   (A)   To respond to the franchising authority contesting the assertion of
noncompliance; or
   (B)   To cure such default; or
   (C)   In the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be
cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such
default and notify the franchising authority of the steps being taken and the
projected date that they will be completed.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.77 PUBLIC HEARING.
   In the event that the grantee fails to respond to the notice described in §
92.75 pursuant to the procedures set forth in §
92.76, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 60 days
after the grantee is notified of the alleged default pursuant to §
92.75, the franchising authority shall schedule a public meeting to investigate
the default. Such public meeting shall be held at the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the franchising authority which is scheduled at a time which is no
less than five business days therefrom. The franchising authority shall notify
the grantee of the time and place of such meeting and provide the grantee with
an opportunity to be heard.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.78 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the
franchising authority, after such meeting, determines that the grantee is in
default of any provision of the franchise, the franchising authority may:
      (1)   Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under this
franchise, if any, including without limitation, any bonds or other surety;
provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in such
amount as the franchising authority reasonably determines is necessary to
remedy the default;
      (2)   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief;
      (3)   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked; or
      (4)   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages.
   (B)   The grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply
promptly with any provision of the franchise by reason of any failure of the
franchising authority to enforce prompt compliance.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.79 ACTS OF GOD.
   The grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the
provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating
thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by strikes,
acts of God, power outages, or other events reasonably beyond its ability to
control.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
§ 92.80 UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION.
   In addition to those criminal and civil remedies provided by state and
federal law, it shall be a misdemeanor for any person, firm, or corporation to
create or make use of any unauthorized connection, whether physically,
electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any part of the
cable system without the express consent of the grantee. Further, without the
express consent of the grantee, it shall be a misdemeanor for any person to
tamper with, remove, or injure any property, equipment, or part of the cable
system or any means of receiving cable service or other services provided
thereto. Subject to applicable federal and state law, the franchising authority
shall incorporate into its criminal code, if not presently a part thereof,
criminal misdemeanor law which will enforce the intent of this section.

assess against the owner of any railroad or street railroad occupying any such

proposed, shall be entitled to and shall be afforded a full and fair hearing
before the Board of Commissioners, as to all matters affecting the property or
any claim of personal liability or objection to any irregularity or invalidity
of any of the proceedings with reference to the making of the improvements, or

contest any assessment proposed to be levied and any personal liability, the
regularity of the proceedings with reference to the improvement and the benefit
of the improvement to their property, and no assessment shall be made against
the owner of any abutting property or against his property in any event, in
excess of the benefit to such owner in the enhanced value of his property by
means of such improvement, as ascertained at such hearing.
      (2) At the hearing aforesaid, the persons, firms, corporations, or

all supports, braces, guys and anchors shall be kept in repair. The Director
may order the removal of any sign that is not maintained in accordance with
this section. Such removal shall be accomplished at the expense of the owner or
person in charge of the premises. Failure to comply with such order shall
constitute a misdemeanor.

such existing signs must be made in accordance with, and are subject to, the
provisions herein contained. Except as were specifically provided any
nonconforming sign which is damaged or is deteriorated to a point where its
restoration cost exceeds 60% of its replacement value shall be removed.

   (A)   Every aquatic facility shall be under the supervision of the permit
holder, who shall be responsible for compliance with all parts of this article
relating to aquatic facility maintenance, aquatic facility operation, and
safety of swimmers. It shall be unlawful for such permit holder to cause or
permit the existence of a condition which violates any section of this chapter.

trained designee to:
      (1)   Assure that someone can physically respond within one hour of being
notified by the regulatory authority to the site of the aquatic facility; and
         (a)   Check at least once per day that the aquatic facility remains in

            1.   Disinfectant levels;
            2.   pH levels; and
            3.   Cyanuric acid levels (if applicable).
         (c)   Ensure that an appropriate method is used to check water
chemistry as specified in state aquatic facility regulations.
            1.   Retain records of daily water chemistry checks for at least
two years on site;
            2.   All records must be made available to the regulatory authority
upon request; and
            3.   Register certification as a certified pool operator or manager
of operations with the regulatory authority and maintain a copy of the
registration on-site at the facility. In the event that the certified pool
operator/manager of operations is no longer employed on premises, the aquatic
facility must employ another certified pool operator/manager of operations who
possesses or obtains a current Wichita Falls Wichita County Public Health
District Manager of Operations or certified pool operator as defined by this
chapter.
      (2)   To ensure compliance with this chapter, it is recommended that all
Manager of Operations/Certified Pool Operators use a DPD test kit certified by
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
   (B)   All pumps, filters, sanitizers, and chemical feeders, drains, ladders,
lighting, ropes and appurtenant equipment used in the operation of all aquatic
facilities, shall be maintained in a good state of repair.
   (C)   All aquatic facilities shall be treated and maintained in accordance
with current state Department of Health Standards unless otherwise stated:
      (1)   Every pool shall contain a sanitizer concentration equivalent to a
free chlorine residual between 1.0-8.0 ppm. Every spa shall contain a minimum
sanitary concentration equivalent to a free chlorine residual of 3.0 - 8.0 ppm
minimum. If an aquatic facility is outside the required range of free chlorine
residual equivalent, then the aquatic facility shall be immediately closed to
the public. A test kit for measuring the concentration of the free chlorine
shall be present at each aquatic facility. The regulatory authority must
approve use of any sanitizer other than chlorine.
      (2)   Every aquatic facility shall have water with a pH of not less than
7.2 and not more than 7.8. An adequate pH test kit shall be present at each
aquatic facility. If an aquatic facility test shows an acid reaction less than
7.2 or basic reaction over 7.8, then the aquatic facility shall be immediately
closed to the public.
      (3)   The presence of microorganisms of the total coliform group or E.
coli in any water sample shall be deemed unacceptable water quality. Two
consecutive samples showing microorganisms of total coliform will be grounds
for immediate closure of the aquatic facility.
      (4)   Every aquatic facility shall have water clarity sufficient for the
main drain or a six-inch diameter turbidity test disk placed at the deepest
part of the aquatic facility, to be visible from the sidewalks of the aquatic
facility at all distances up to ten yards, measured from a line drawn across
the pool through the disc. Failure to meet this requirement shall be sufficient
cause for immediate closure of the aquatic facility.
      (5)   A 15-minute maximum timer will be installed and operational at each
spa. The timer must be located so that it cannot be reached unless a person
exits the spa.
      (6)   Cyanuric acid shall not exceed 100 ppm in any aquatic facility. If
the level exceeds 100 ppm, the facility shall close until the level can be
lowered to below 80 ppm.
      (7)   During any routine inspection, if the regulatory authority is
required to close the pool for non-compliance, a re-inspection fee may be
charged to the permit holder for each requested return visit for re-inspection
(Ord. 781, passed 5-17-10; Am. Ord. 948, passed 5-30-19)
§ 100.07 REGULATIONS IN POOL AND SPA AREA; SUSPENSION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   A person commits an offense if he or she violates any portion of this
chapter or the standards set forth by the State Department of Health.
   (B)   Failure to comply with any section of this chapter may result in the
immediate closure of the aquatic facility and/or the initiation of legal
action. Upon determination that the aquatic facility does not comply with the
provisions of this chapter, the regulatory authority shall notify the permit
holder or Manager of Operations of the existing violations. If the regulatory
authority determines that the condition of the aquatic facility may be
hazardous to the health or safety of the swimmers or the general public, the
aquatic facility shall be immediately closed. A new water sample and inspection
of the aquatic facility will be conducted from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., Monday
through Thursday at the request of the pool Manager of Operations or the permit
holder. The aquatic facility water must completely turnover through the
filtration and chlorination system at least once before reinspection and
resampling. If compliance has been achieved, the permit holder shall be
notified that the aquatic facility may be opened.
   (C)   When the regulatory authority has ordered that an aquatic facility be
closed due to noncompliance with any provision of this chapter, the permit
holder shall not allow the aquatic facility to be used for swimming, diving or
bathing purposes and shall immediately take every reasonable step to prevent
the use of such aquatic facility for such purposes. By way of example and
without limiting such duty, the permit holder shall immediately:
      (1)   Post notices reasonably likely to come to the attention of
potential users of the pool or spa advising of the closure;
      (2)   Lock all gates and doorways in any fence or other enclosure
surrounding such pool; and
      (3)   Failure to immediately comply with the above will result in the
regulatory authority posting a sign at the pool, which states, "Pool Closed by
Order of the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District." It shall be
unlawful to remove, cover, or mutilate such sign without the approval of the
regulatory authority. Use of the aquatic facility by an individual for
swimming, diving or bathing purposes after the regulatory authority has ordered
such aquatic facility to be closed shall be deemed prima facie evidence that
the permit holder of such aquatic facility has knowingly allowed the aquatic
facility to be used for such purposes.
   (D)   The regulatory authority shall suspend a permit to operate a public
pool or spa if:
      (1)   A permit holder fails to designate a certified Manager of
Operations as specified in this chapter;
      (2)   The condition or operation of a pool or spa is considered to be
hazardous or constitutes an imminent health hazard to the health or safety of
swimmers or the general public;
      (3)   The permit holder fails to keep all spa equipment and devices
working properly; or
      (4)   The suspension shall continue until the regulatory authority has
conducted a new inspection, and the cause of suspension is corrected.

plans and specifications for such construction or remodeling to the City
Building Inspections Department for review.
   (B)   The plans and specifications shall indicate the proposed layout and
arrangement of mechanical, plumbing, fencing, electrical, construction
materials of work areas, the type, and model of proposed fixed equipment and
facilities and all associated buildings or structures.
   (C)   A licensed professional engineer shall examine the final aquatic
facility design/blueprints for all new and extensively remodeled aquatic
facilities (including structural, mechanical, plumbing or electrical
renovations) and certify by original signature and engineer's seal compliance
with state aquatic facility regulations and this chapter.
   (D)   No work shall begin until regulatory authority has received the
engineer's certificate of pre-construction, conducted a plan review, and has
communicated with the City Building Inspections Department that a building
permit may be issued. Work shall commence and conclude within the time allowed
by such permits. Deviations from approved plans shall not be permitted without
approval in writing from the regulatory authority and the City Building
Inspections Department. If no work has begun within 180 days from the date the
regulatory authority has given written notice that work may begin, or if work
has begun and is halted more than 60 days, the Director may withdraw approval.
   (E)   The aquatic facility construction shall pass a pre-gunite inspection,
pre-plaster inspection and pre-operational inspection by the regulatory
authority prior to issuance of a permit. The completion of these inspections by
a regulatory authority does not substitute or replace inspections required by
other departments within the city.
   (F)   It is the responsibility of the person in charge to ensure that the
building permit applicant and licensed professional engineer comply with all
zoning, building, fire, and health ordinances of the city.

inspection score and letter grade for the food establishment will be available
and that is managed by the regulatory authority.
            4.   In the event that a mobile or other device is unavailable in
order to use the QR code function, food establishments will have readily
available and furnish a copy of their most recent inspection report, upon
request, to the public for viewing.
         (b)   In the event that a food establishment is operated in the same
building or space as a separately licensed or permitted business, or in the

§ 113.01 PURPOSE.
   Minors who do not have the consent of their parents are prohibited, by state

establishments near areas frequented by minors would significantly increase the

state law. Moreover, the location of body art establishments affects the value
of property in the area where a studio is located. The following sections
regulate the establishment and location of body art establishments to promote
the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. Further,
periodic inspections of body art establishments authorized by the city to
insure compliance with state law is a legitimate law enforcement endeavor to
promote the general health and welfare of the citizens of the city.

(or its successor agency) pursuant to the authority granted under Chapter 146
of the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event of any conflict between the
definitions or terms used in this chapter with terms defined or construed under
state law, the state law definition or construction will prevail.
   (B) Body Art. The practice of physical body adornment by permitted
establishments and operators utilizing, but not limited to, the following

tattooing, such as eyebrows, eyeliner, and lipliner, is not considered body art
for the purpose of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Texas Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
§ 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)

the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   “STRUCTURE.” For floodplain 'management purposes, a walled and roofed
building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above
ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   “SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   “SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   “VARIANCE.” A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see § 60.6 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations - Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations).
   “VIOLATION.” The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
   “WATER SURFACE ELEVATION.” The height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.

   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
152.22(B) of this chapter (Permit Procedures) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
Chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (as stated in §
152.03 of this chapter, Statement of Purpose).
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that
      (1)   The criteria outlined in § 152.44 (A) - (K) of this chapter
(Variance Procedures) are met, and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
§ 152.33 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
152.07 of this chapter (Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood
Hazard), are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable,
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet
above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high
as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two
feet if no depth number is specified).
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet
above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high
as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two
feet if no depth number is specified); or
         (b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below
the Base Flood Elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
      (3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in § 152.42 of this chapter (Permit Procedures) are
satisfied.
      (4)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
§ 152.34 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways, located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
152.07 of this chapter (Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood
Hazard), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of §§
152.30 through
152.34 (Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction).
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the
provisions required by 44 C.F.R. § 65.12.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this court
order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than $500 for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Each day a violation occurs is a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

they shall, in general, be arranged in such a manner as to cause no hardship to
owners of adjoining property for their future platting and provide access to
them which will not be taxable or accessible for special improvements shall not
be permitted in any subdivision unless such reserve strips are conveyed to the
city in fee simple.
   (L)   Firelanes shall be provided between any buildings, structures, or
accessory buildings where residential entrances do not face a dedicated or

§ 155.49 PARK AND SCHOOL SITES.
   (A)   All subdividers must set aside land for parks or school sites within
the areas proposed to be subdivided where required by the city. For every 100
lots in a subdivision for single-family homes, one acre must be set aside for
park and/or school sites. In the event land is to be subdivided for duplex or

units to be constructed.
   (B)   If a site for a park (as shown in the comprehensive plan) lies within
the area to be subdivided, that area shall be designated on the plat. If the
area needed for park purposes exceeds that land or is otherwise required by
this chapter, the city shall determine if the entire site is needed for the
proposed purpose. If not, the subdivider is only required to sell that portion
of the area otherwise required by this chapter to the city or county. The city
must within 90 days of the plat's recording, execute an agreement to purchase
the park site within two years. Failure of the city or county to execute such
an agreement within the stipulated time will release the owner or subdivider
from an obligation to reserve said site or sites. The purchase price of a park
site shall be determined by totaling the following:
      (1)   Appraised raw land value of site prior to subdividing.
      (2)   One-half the cost of grading, paving, curb and gutter, and drainage
of contiguous streets.
      (3)   The cost of utilities to serve the site as determined by the City
Manager.
   (C)   The land to be dedicated for park purposes must be suitable for such
purposes as determined by the appropriate city officials. In no case shall the
city be required to accept any site.
   (D)   In the event that the subdivision is of such size that the area
required for park purposes is less than five acres, the site must be located on
a side of the subdivision not bounded by roads and on which additional land may
be acquired as the area is subdivided.

TOWNHOUSE AND CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT
§ 155.75 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Because of the newness of townhouses, condominiums, cluster houses and
other such housing concepts in the city, and because such housing does not fall
into any existing residential subdivision, the city finds that a set of
guidelines are necessary to set forth the city's policy and attitudes towards
these housing types. The city does encourage new and creative ideas when such
ideas are in the best interest of the city as a whole, therefore, each proposed
development must be reviewed individually and judged on its merits. In order to
provide for individual review it has been decided that all townhouses,
condominiums, cluster housing and other such concepts shall be allowed only
under Planned Development.
   (B)   In approving a townhouse project, the city shall assure itself that
the project meets the following conditions:
      (1)   That property adjacent to the area included in the project shall
not be adversely affected.
      (2)   That the lots or area within the project shall be used only for
single-family dwellings and uses commonly accessory thereto such as garages,
carports, or storage areas.
      (3)   That the project is consistent with the intent and purpose to
promote health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
   (B)   This type of subdivision requires "a comprehensive site plan" and that
the site plan and chapter "shall set forth" various requirements, therefore,
the guidelines of this subchapter are given to show what is expected in regard
to these various requirements.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
§ 155.76 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "CONDOMINIUM STRUCTURE." Four or more condominium apartments each having a
width of not less than 18 feet in a single building.
   "TOWNHOUSE." A structure on an individual lot, which is one of a series of
dwelling units designed for single-family occupancy, which dwelling units are
structurally connected or immediately adjacent to and abutting each other
without side yards between individual dwelling units. A "condominium apartment"
(as defined in Article 1301a, V.A.T.S.) in a "condominium structure" may be
considered a townhouse if no other dwelling unit or use of any kind exists
immediately above or below it.
   "TOWNHOUSE PROJECT." A development consisting of not less than one acre of
land having not less than 100 feet of continuous frontage on an access street
or and interior street and not less than four townhouses.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
§ 155.77 GENERAL LOCATION.
   Each application shall be judged on its appropriateness to its site and to
its compatibility with existing development or other proposed development. It
is felt that through proper planning it is possible to design townhouse
development to fit most areas of the city. This is not to say that such a plan
is economically feasible.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
§ 155.78 COMPREHENSIVE SITE PLAN.
   (A)   The Comprehensive Site Plan is to be a graphic plan including all of

application. This plan need not be detailed but must show:
      (1)   Use areas;
      (2)   Land areas for building, principal roadways, parkways, buffers,
screenings; and
      (3)   Number and type of dwelling units.
   (B)   Notes, sketches, photographs and drawings may be attached to the
development plan to illustrate the intent of treatment of parkways, auto
parking areas, buffer strips, screening and shrubs, roadway design, special
subdivision lotting plans and other such ideas which cannot be satisfactorily
explained otherwise. Such notes, sketches, photographs, and drawings shall be
used to evaluate detailed site plans. If the Comprehensive Site Plan is only
conceptual in nature, no building permit shall be issued until a Detailed Site
Plan is approved by the City Council.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
§ 155.79 DETAILED SITE PLAN.
   (A)   A Detailed Site Plan shall be approved prior to issuance of a building

      (2)   Use of buildings;
      (3)   Number of dwelling units;
      (4)   Lotting plans if applicable;
      (5)   Diagrammatic utility layouts; and
      (6)   Other such things which serve to show that the proposed development
will be compatible with the surrounding area and will provide a wholesome
environment for future residents.
   (B)   The site plan may be composed of several sheets and may include
photographs and sketches if necessary.
   (C)   The Detailed Site Plan and the Comprehensive Site Plan may be one-in-
the-same if all conditions of both are met. In the event of a Multi-Phase
Project, it is intended that a Detailed Site Plan be submitted only on the area
that is proposed for immediate development. Additional plans may be approved as
additional phases are ready to be developed. All Detailed Site Plans shall be
in general conformance with the Comprehensive Site Plan and applications for
building permits will be reviewed based on the Detailed Site Plan.

and defining the powers and duties of each body; providing for a penalty for

   Be it ordained by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Burkburnett,
Texas, that the following Ordinance (together with all appendices referred to
herein) is hereby adopted as the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Burkburnett, Texas, and the zoning district map referred to in Article I, §
3 below is hereby adopted as the official zoning district map for the City of
Burkburnett, Texas.
   This Ordinance shall be effective on the date it is finally adopted by the
Board of Commissioners of the City of Burkburnett, Texas.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 2 TITLE AND PURPOSE.
   This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the City of Burkburnett’s
“Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance” or “Zoning Ordinance”, and is also sometimes
referred to herein as “this Ordinance”.
   As authorized by Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government Code, the zoning
regulations and districts as herein established have been made in accordance
with an adopted comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the public
health, safety, morals and general welfare, and protecting and preserving
places and areas of historical, cultural and/or architectural importance and
significance within the city. They have been designed to lessen the congestion
in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to ensure
adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land and thus avoid
undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, wastewater treatment, schools, parks and other public
requirements. They have been made with reasonable consideration, among other
things, for the character of each zoning district and its peculiar suitability
for the particular uses specified; and with a view to conserving the value of
buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 3 ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   The city is hereby divided into zones, or districts, and the boundaries of
zoning districts set out herein are delineated upon the zoning district map of
the city, which may also be cited as the “zoning map”, said map being adopted
as a part of this Ordinance as fully as if the same were set forth herein in
detail.
3.1   One original of the zoning district map shall be filed in the office of
the City Secretary and labeled as “Zoning Map of the City of Burkburnett, Texas
— Ordinance #589”. This copy shall be the official zoning district map and
shall bear the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Secretary, and the
seal of the city under the following words: “This is to certify that this is
the Official Zoning Map referred to in Section 3 of the Zoning Ordinance,
Ordinance 589 of the City of Burkburnett, Texas, adopted on the 17th day of
April, 2000". This copy shall not be changed in any manner. In case of any
question, this copy, together with amending ordinances, shall be controlling.
3.2   A copy of the original zoning district map shall be placed in the office
of the City Manager, or his/her designee. The map copy shall be used for
reference and shall be maintained up-to-date by posting thereon all subsequent
amendments. Reproductions for informational purposes may only be made of the
official zoning district map or this copy.
      Any changes/amendments made to the zoning district boundaries shall be
made on the map copy promptly after the amendment has been approved by the
Board of Commissioners, together with a descriptive entry on the map as
follows: “On the following date(s), by official action of the Board of
Commissioners of Burkburnett, Texas, the following change(s) was made on the
city’s official zoning district map: (enter the amending ordinance number, the
adoption date, and a brief description of the nature of the map revision)”. The
descriptive entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the City
Secretary.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 4 ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
4.1   The zoning district boundary lines shown on the zoning district map are
usually along streets, alleys, property lines, or extensions thereof. where
uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the zoning
district map, the following rules shall apply:
      A.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerline.
      B.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
      C.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be
construed as following city limits.
      D.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be midway between the right-of-way lines.
      E.   Boundaries indicated as following the centerline of creeks, streams
or drainageways shall be construed to follow such centerline, and in the event
of change in the centerline shall be construed to move with such centerline.
      F.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated with Subsections A. through E. above shall be so construed. Distances
not specifically indicated on the zoning district map shall be determined by
the scale of the map.
      G.   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by
official action of the Board of Commissioners or whenever such area is
franchised for building purposes, the zoning district line adjoining each side
of such street, alley or other public way shall be automatically extended to
the centerline of such vacated street, alley or public way and all areas so
involved shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the
extended districts.
      H.   The zoning classification applied to a tract of land adjacent to a
street shall extend to the centerline of the street unless, as a condition of
zoning approval, it is stated that the zoning classification shall not apply to
the street.
      I.   Where physical features on the ground are at variance with
information shown on the zoning district map, or if there arises a question as
to how or whether a parcel of property is zoned and such question cannot be
resolved by the application of Subsections A. through H., or if the zoning of
property is invalidated by a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the
property shall be considered classified as "AG" (Agriculture District) in the
same manner as provided for newly annexed territory.

(EPA), Texas Air Control Board (TACB), Texas State Department of Health (TSDH),
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or any other
applicable state or federal agency, as the case may be.
5.3   No lot upon which a building has been erected shall later be so reduced
in area that the setbacks, yards and/or open spaces shall be smaller than those
required by this Ordinance, nor shall a part of a yard or other open space
required by this Ordinance for any building/lot be included as a part of a yard
or other open space similarly required for another building/lot.
5.4   No building shall hereafter be erected or altered.
      A.   To have more narrow or smaller front, side or rear yards than those
required by this Ordinance;

is located.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 6 ZONING UPON ANNEXATION.
6.1   As soon as practical following annexation, the Board of Commissioners
shall, on its own motion, initiate proceedings to establish Agricultural (“AG”)
zoning on the newly annexed territory; thereupon the City Manager, or his/her
designee, shall commence public notification and other standard procedures for
zoning amendments as set forth in §
10 of this Ordinance. Said proceedings to establish zoning may be undertaken
concurrently with annexation procedures (i.e., notified at the same time,
public hearings scheduled at the same time as annexation, and the like),
however zoning approval and formal adoption of the ordinance establishing
zoning must occur after annexation approval/adoption has occurred and as a
separate and distinct action by the Board of Commissioners.
6.2   The Board of Commissioners may, upon its own motion, elect to zone newly
annexed territory with a more permanent zoning classification (e.g., SF-10, SF-
6, MF, C/B, and the like) than the Agricultural (“AG”) zoning designation upon
a determination that such permanent zoning is in conformance with the city’s
adopted comprehensive plan, is the most appropriate zoning classification for
the subject property, is in the best interest of the City of Burkburnett, and
is not detrimental to adjacent property or to the public health, safety and
welfare.
6.3   The initial zoning of a land parcel, whether it is interim in nature, by
initiation of the landowner or by initiation of the city, must meet the
requirements for notification and public hearings as set forth in §
10 of this Ordinance and all other applicable state laws.
6.4   The owner of land to be annexed may submit an application for zoning the
property simultaneously with submission of the petition for annexation, but no
such annexation application may be made conditioned upon the approval of any
particular zoning classification.
6.5   Within an area classified as “AG” (Agriculture).
      A.   No permit for the construction of a building or use of land shall be
issued by the Building Official, or his/her designee, other than a permit which
will allow the construction of a building or use permitted in the “AG”
district, unless and until such territory has been classified in a zoning
district other than the “AG” district by the Board of Commissioners in the
manner prescribed by §
10, except as provided in Subsection B. below.
      B.   If plans and/or preparations for developing a property for a use
other than those specified in the “AG” district were already in progress prior
to annexation of the property into the City of Burkburnett, then the Board of
Commissioners may authorize construction of the project by a majority vote.
Application of this subsection is contingent upon the following:
         1.   An application for a building permit for the proposed building/
use must be made to the Building Official of the City of Burkburnett (or his/
her designee) within three months after annexation of the property into the
city; and
         2.   The applicant must be able to demonstrate that plans and other
preparations for developing the property commenced prior to (i.e., were already
in progress at the time of) annexation into the city.
         In its deliberations concerning authorization to proceed with
construction of a project which meets the above criteria, the Board of
Commissioners shall take into consideration the appropriate land use for the
area as shown on the city's Future Land Use Plan. Upon approval by the Board of
Commissioners, the City Manager (or his/her designee) shall notify the Building
Official (or his/her designee) of such approval.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
ADMINISTRATION
§ 7 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
7.1   Intent of provisions.
      A.   Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments
thereto, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and
characteristics of use which were lawfully in existence and operating before
this Ordinance was enacted, amended or otherwise made applicable to such lots,
structures or uses, but which do not now conform to the regulations of the
district in which they are located. It is the intent of this Ordinance to
permit such nonconforming uses to continue, as long as the conditions within
this section and other applicable sections of this Ordinance are met.
      B.   It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconforming uses
and/or structures shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, and shall
not be used as a basis for adding or substituting other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
      C.   Nonconforming uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with the
permitted uses in the districts involved.
7.2   Nonconforming status.
      Any use, platted lot, or structure which does not conform with the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located shall be deemed a
nonconforming use, platted lot, or structure when:
      A.   Such use, platted lot, or structure was in existence and lawfully
operating as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and has since been in
regular and continuous use; or
      B.   Such use, platted lot, or structure was in existence and lawfully
operating as of the effective date of any amendment to this Ordinance, but by
such amendment is placed in a district wherein such use, platted lot, or
structure is no longer permitted, and has since been in regular and continuous
use; or
      C.   Such use, platted lot, or structure was in existence and lawfully
operating at the time of annexation into the city and has since been in regular
and continuous use.
7.3   Continuing lawful use of property and existence of structures.
      A.   The lawful use of land or lawful existence of structures as of the
effective date of this Ordinance, although such do not conform to the
provisions hereof, may be continued; but if said nonconforming use or structure
is discontinued or abandoned, as these terms are defined in Subsection B.
below, any future use of said premises shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance.
      B.   "Discontinuance" of a nonconforming use shall be defined as the
actual act or date that the use is discontinued (i.e., ceases to operate on the
subject property). "Abandonment" of a nonconforming use or structure shall be
defined as the actual act or date of abandonment as described in Subsection C.
      C.   When a nonconforming use or structure which does not meet the
development standards in this Ordinance ceases to be used in such manner as
stated in Subsection B. above for a time period of six months or longer, such
use shall not be resumed and proof of such event shall constitute prima facie
evidence of an act of abandonment, except as allowed in § 7.5.E. Any
nonconforming use which does not involve a permanent type of structure or
operation and which is moved from the premises shall be considered to have been
abandoned.
      D.   No nonconforming use or structure may be expanded, re-occupied with
another nonconforming use, or increased following the effective date of this
Ordinance except as provided in § 7.5.
      E.   Conforming single-family residential uses on platted lots which were
approved prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, which may now be
nonconforming due to stricter standards, shall be deemed in conformance with
this Ordinance as long as the use of the lot is allowed in the respective
district. Only the lot size, depth, setbacks and width shall be allowed to be
less than the regulations prescribed in the zoning district in which it is
located. All other regulations of this Ordinance shall be met or the lot shall
be considered nonconforming.
      F.   Any existing vacant lot platted prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, which was legally conforming, shall be deemed a conforming lot.
      G.   Maintenance and upkeep of the nonconforming use/structure is
permitted (i.e., painting, and the like).
7.4   Changing nonconforming land uses and structures.
      A.   Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use, and once
such change is made, the use shall not be changed back to a nonconforming use.
      B.   Where a conforming use is located in a nonconforming structure, the
use may be changed to another conforming use by the process outlined in § 7.5
below.
      C.   A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use
or structure.
7.5   Expansion of nonconforming uses and structures.
      An expansion of a nonconforming use or structure is allowed in accordance
with the following:
      A.   A nonconforming use located within a building may be extended
throughout the existing building, provided that;
         1.   No structural alteration (except as provided in Subsection E.
below) may be made on or in the building except those required by law to
preserve such building in a safe and structurally sound condition.
         2.   The number of dwelling units or rooms in a nonconforming
residential use shall not be increased so as to exceed the number of dwelling
units or rooms existing at the time said use became a nonconforming use.
      B.   No nonconforming use within a building may be extended to occupy any
land outside the building.
      C.   No nonconforming use of land or building shall be enlarged,
increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at
the time the land became a nonconforming use, except to provide off-street
loading or off-street parking space.
      D.   The minimum residential lot areas for the various zoning districts
shall be in accordance with their respective districts, except that a lot
having less area than herein required which was an official "lot of record"
prior to the effective date of this Ordinance may be used for a single-family
dwelling.
      E.   Buildings or structures which do not conform to the area regulations
or development standards in this Ordinance, but where the uses are deemed
conforming, shall not increase the gross floor area by more than 10%.
      F.   Buildings or structures which have been vacant or abandoned for more
than six months and do not meet the current area regulations or development
standards shall be allowed to be re-occupied by a conforming use if Subsection
E. above is followed.
      G.   A nonconforming use may be required to provide screening such that
its operations (or some portion of its operations/facility) are not visible
from the street or surrounding property, may be required to eliminate any
nuisance factor caused by the nonconforming use, or the nonconforming use may
be eliminated itself if it is deemed detrimental or hazardous to the health,
safety or welfare of nearby residents or other citizens. The Planning and
Zoning Commission may, following notice and public hearing, review any of the
above situations and may make an appropriate recommendation (i.e., to provide
screening, to eliminate a nuisance factor, or to eliminate the nonconforming
use itself) to the Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners may,
after appropriate notice and public hearing, make a final ruling on any of the
above situations. Any unfavorable recommendation by the Planning and Zoning
Commission may be appealed to the Board of Commissioners, whereupon a three-
quarters vote of the Board of Commissioners will be required to reverse (i.e.,
overrule) the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation.
7.6   Restoration of nonconforming structure.
      A.   If a structure occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire,
the elements, or some other cause, it may not be rebuilt except to conform to
the provisions of this Ordinance. In the case of partial destruction of a
nonconforming structure which does not exceed 50% of its total appraised value
as determined by the Wichita County Central Appraisal District, reconstruction
will be permitted, but the previously existing square footage of the structure
and/or the function of the nonconforming use cannot be expanded.
      B.   Notwithstanding the provisions of § 7.6.A. above, any property owner
in a Single-Family-6 (SF-6) zoning district who owns a mobile home or
manufactured home which was legally in existence on the date of adoption of
this Ordinance may replace such structure with a HUD-Code manufactured home
that is five years old or newer (i.e., manufacture date is less than or equal
to five years prior to the date the structure is placed on the property to
replace the destroyed structure).
7.7   Relocation of nonconforming structure.
      A.   A nonconforming structure can be relocated (i.e., moved) to another
site on the same lot/tract upon which it was previously located, subject to
submission of a structure relocation plan to the Building Official (or his/her
designee) for review and approval, and subject to compliance with setback
regulations for the zoning district in which the structure is located. If said
setback regulations of the zoning district cannot be reasonably adhered to,
then the Building Official (or his/her designee) may waive this requirement
upon a finding that such waiver would be in the public interest and would not
be detrimental or hazardous to the health, safety, welfare or convenience of
nearby property owners or other citizens.
      B.   Should a nonconforming structure be relocated (i.e., moved) from its
original site to a different lot/tract, it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations (e.g., setbacks, height, square footage, construction materials,
and the like) for the zoning district into which it is moved.
7.8   Completion of structures.
      A.   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans,
construction or designated use of the following:
         1.   A building or structure for which a building permit has been
issued or a site plan approved prior to the effective date of this Ordinance;
or
         2.   A building or structure for which a substantially complete
application for a building permit was accepted by the Building Official (or
his/her designee) on or before the effective date of this Ordinance; provided,
however, that such building permit shall comply with all applicable ordinances
of the City of Burkburnett in effect on the date such application was filed and
the building permit is issued within 30 days of the effective date of this
Ordinance.

      A.   There is hereby created a Zoning Board of Adjustments (ZBA), also
hereafter referred to as the "Board of Adjustments", for the purpose, in

of the City of Burkburnett.
9.2   Members; terms of office.
      A.   The Zoning Board of Adjustments shall consist of five regular

Choice of the alternate member to serve at a particular meeting of the Board of
Adjustments shall be on an alternating basis such that both alternates have
equal opportunities to serve.
      C.   Regular Board of Adjustments members and alternate members shall

a simple majority vote of the Board of Commissioners for the remainder of the
term(s).
      E.   Members of the Board of Adjustments may be removed from office for
cause, and after a public hearing, by a simple majority vote of the full Board
of Commissioners. Failure to attend three consecutive scheduled meetings shall

Adjustments. The City Manager’s designee shall serve as Secretary to the Board
of Adjustments, and shall keep minutes of all meetings held by the Board of

regulations and bylaws for its own government, which shall conform as nearly as
possible with those governing the Board of Commissioners, and the rules,
regulations and bylaws shall be subject to approval by the Board of
Commissioners.
9.3   Meetings.
      A.   Meetings of the Zoning Board of Adjustments shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board of Adjustments may
determine. All meetings of the Board of Adjustments shall be open to the
public. Four members of the Board of Adjustments shall constitute a quorum for
the conduct of business. All cases to be heard by the Board of Adjustments
shall always be heard by at least 75% of the members, which constitutes four
members.
9.4   Authority of Board of Adjustments.
      The Zoning Board of Adjustments shall have the authority, subject to the
standards established in the Texas Local Government Code §§ 211.008 through
211.011 and those established herein, to exercise powers and to perform duties
including the following:
      A.   Hear and decide an appeal that alleges error in an order,
requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this Ordinance; and
      B.   Authorize, in specific cases, a variance (see § 9.6) from the terms
of this Ordinance if the variance is not contrary to the public interest and,
due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this Ordinance would result
in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this Ordinance is observed
and substantial justice is done.
      C.   In exercising its authority under Subsection A. above, the Board of
Adjustments may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the
administrative official's order, requirement, decision or determination from
which an appeal is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision or
determination, and for that purpose the Board of Adjustments has the same
authority as the administrative official.
      D.   The concurring vote of at least 75%, or four members, of the full
Board of Adjustments is necessary to:
         1.   Reverse an order, requirement, decision or determination of an
administrative official;
         2.   Decide in favor of an applicant on a matter on which the Board of
Adjustments is required to review under this Zoning Ordinance; or
         3.   Authorize a variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
9.5   Limitations on authority of Board of Adjustments.
      A.   The Board of Adjustments may not grant a variance authorizing a use
other than those permitted in the district for which the variance is sought,
except as provided in § 9.7.
      B.   The Board of Adjustments shall have no power to grant or modify
specific use provisions authorized under §§
26 and
27 of these regulations.
      C.   The Board of Adjustments shall have no power to grant a zoning
amendment. In the event that a request for a zoning amendment is pending before
the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of Commissioners, the Board of
Adjustments shall neither hear nor grant any variances with respect to the
subject property until final disposition of the zoning amendment.
      D.   The Board of Adjustments shall not grant a variance for any parcel
of property or portion thereof upon which a site plan, preliminary plat or
final plat, where required, is pending on the agenda of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and, where applicable, by the Board of Commissioners. All
administrative remedies available to the applicant shall have been exhausted
prior to hearing by the Zoning Board of Adjustments.
9.6   Variances.
      A.   The Zoning Board of Adjustments may authorize a variance from these
regulations when, in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring
strict compliance. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustments shall
prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary for, or desirable to, the
public interest. In making the findings hereinbelow required, the Board of
Adjustments shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land
involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will
reside or work within the proposed use, and the probable effect such variance
will have upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety,
convenience and welfare of the community.
      B.   Conditions required for variance. No variance shall be granted
without first having given public notice and having held a public hearing on
the variance request in accordance with § 9.8 of this Ordinance and unless the
Zoning Board of Adjustments finds:
         1.   That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his/her land;
and
         2.   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
         3.   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to other property within the
area; and
         4.   That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of
preventing the orderly use of other land within the area in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance.
         Such findings of the Zoning Board of Adjustments, together with the
specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into
the official minutes of the Board of Adjustments meeting at which such variance
is granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this Ordinance so that the public health, safety and
welfare may be secured and that substantial justice may be done.
      C.   Findings of undue hardship. In order to grant a variance, the Board
of Adjustments must make written findings that an undue hardship exists, using
the following criteria:
         1.   That literal enforcement of the controls will create an
unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty in the development of the affected
property; and
         2.   That the situation causing the hardship or difficulty is neither
self-imposed nor generally affecting all or most properties in the same zoning
district; and
         3.   That the relief sought will not injure the permitted use of
adjacent conforming property; and
         4.   That the granting of a variance will be in harmony with the
spirit and purpose of these regulations.
      D.   A variance shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or
personal hardship, nor shall it be based solely upon economic gain or loss, nor
shall it permit any person the privilege in developing a parcel of land not
permitted by this Ordinance to other parcels of land in the particular zoning
district. No variance may be granted which results in undue hardship upon
another parcel of land.
      E.   The applicant bears the burden of proof in establishing the facts
that may justify a variance.
9.7   Appeals to the Zoning Board of Adjustments.
      A.   Authority. In addition to the authorization of variances from the
terms of this Ordinance, the Zoning Board of Adjustments shall have the
authority to hear and decide an appeal that alleges error in an order,
requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this Ordinance. The Zoning Board of Adjustments may reverse
or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the administrative official's
order, requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is taken and
make the correct order, requirement, decision or determination, and for that
purpose, the Zoning Board of Adjustments has the same authority as the
administrative official. The Zoning Board of Adjustments may also hear and
decide other matters authorized by the Subdivision Ordinance and other
ordinances regarding land use/development regulations.
      B.   Who may appeal. Any of the following persons may appeal to the
Zoning Board of Adjustments a decision made by an administrative official:
         1.   A person directly aggrieved by the decision; or
         2.   Any officer, department, board or office of the municipality
affected by the decision.
      C.   Procedure for appeal. The appellant must file with the Zoning Board
of Adjustments and the official from whom the appeal is taken a written notice
of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal. The appeal must be filed
within 60 days after the decision has been rendered. Upon receiving the notice,
the official from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to the
Zoning Board of Adjustments all papers constituting the record of action that
is appealed. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that
is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies in
writing to the Zoning Board of Adjustments facts supporting the official's
opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that
case, the proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the
Zoning Board of Adjustments or a court of record on application, after notice
to the official, if due cause is shown. The appellant party may appear at the
appeal hearing in person or by agent or attorney. The Board of Adjustments
shall decide the appeal within four weeks after the written request (i.e.,
notice of appeal) was received. The Board of Adjustments may reverse or affirm,
in whole or in part, or modify the administrative official's order,
requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is taken, and may
make the correct order, requirement, decision or determination.
9.8   Procedures.
      A.   Application and fee. An application for a variance by the Zoning
Board of Adjustments shall be made in writing using forms prescribed by the
Board of Adjustments, and shall be accompanied by an application fee (as set
forth in
Appendix A-3), a site plan and/or additional information as may be requested in
order to properly review the application. Such information may include, but is
not limited to, plat plans, site building plans, photographs, topographic
contour maps, and/or other similar documents.
      B.   Review and report by the city. The City Manager, or his/her
designee, shall visit the site where the proposed variance will apply and the
surrounding area, and shall report his/her findings to the Zoning Board of
Adjustments.
      C.   Notice and public hearing. The Zoning Board of Adjustments shall
hold a public hearing for consideration of the variance request no later than
45 days after the date the application for action, or an appeal, is filed.
Notice of the public hearing shall be provided to all property owners within
200 feet of the affected property at least ten days prior to the public
hearing, and also published in the official local newspaper at least ten days
prior to the public hearing.
      D.   Action by the Zoning Board of Adjustments. The Zoning Board of
Adjustments shall not grant a variance unless it finds, based upon compelling
evidence, that each of the conditions in § 9.6 has been established. The Zoning
Board of Adjustments may impose such conditions, limitations and safeguards as
it deems appropriate upon the granting of any variance. Violation of any such
condition, limitation or safeguard shall constitute a violation of this
Ordinance.
9.9   Finality of decisions; judicial review.
      A.   All decisions of the Zoning Board of Adjustments are final and
binding. However, any person aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Board of
Adjustments may present a verified petition to a court of record which states
that the decision of the Board of Adjustments is illegal, in whole or in part,
and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition must be presented
within ten days after the date the decision is filed in the City Secretary's
office. Subject to the provisions of § 211.011 of the Texas Local Government
Code, only a court of record may reverse, affirm or modify a decision of the
Zoning Board of Adjustments.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 10 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS TO ZONING ORDINANCES AND DISTRICTS, AND
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
10.1   Declaration of policy and review criteria.
      The city declares the enactment of these regulations governing the use
and development of land, buildings, and structures as a measure necessary to
the orderly development of the community. Therefore, no change shall be made in
these regulations or in the boundaries of the zoning districts except:
      A.   To correct any error in the regulations or map;
      B.   To recognize changed or changing conditions or circumstances in a
particular locality;
      C.   To recognize changes in technology, the style of living, or manner
of conducting business; or
      D.   To change the property to uses in accordance with the approved
comprehensive plan.
      In making a determination regarding a requested zoning change, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners shall consider
the following factors:
      E.   Whether the uses permitted by the proposed change will be
appropriate in the immediate area concerned and their relationship to the
general area and the city as a whole;
      F.   Whether the proposed change is in accord with any existing or
proposed plans for providing public schools, streets, water supply, sanitary
sewers, and other utilities to the area, and shall note the findings;
      G.   The amount of vacant land currently classified for similar
development in the vicinity and elsewhere in the city, and any special
circumstances which may make a substantial part of such vacant land unavailable
for development;
      H.   The recent rate at which land is being developed in the same zoning
classification as the request, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed
change;
      I.   How other areas designated for similar development will be, or are
unlikely to be, affected if the proposed amendment is approved; and
      J.   Any other factors which will substantially affect the public health,
safety, morals, or general welfare.
10.2   Authority to amend Ordinance.
      The Board of Commissioners may from time to time, after receiving a final
report thereon by the Planning and Zoning Commission and after public hearings
required by law, amend, supplement, or change the regulations herein provided
or the boundaries of the zoning districts specified on the zoning district map.
Any ordinance regulations or zoning district boundary amendment may be ordered
for consideration by the Board of Commissioners, initiated by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, be requested by the owner of real property, or the
authorized representative of an owner of real property.
      Consideration for a change in any district boundary line or special
zoning regulation may be initiated only by the property owner or his/her
authorized agent (proof of such authorization must be submitted with the zoning
application, per § 10.3), or by the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board
of Commissioners on its own motion when it finds that public benefit will be
derived from consideration of such matter. In the event the ownership stated on
an application and that shown in city records are different, the applicant
shall submit proof of ownership and/or verification that he/she is acting as an
authorized agent for the property owner.
      No person who owes delinquent taxes, delinquent paving assessments,
impact fees, or any other delinquent debts or obligations to the City of
Burkburnett, and which are directly attributable to a piece of property
requested for zoning shall be allowed to submit a zoning request until the
taxes, assessments, debts, or obligations directly attributable to said
property and owed by the owner or previous owner thereof shall have been first
fully discharged by payment, or until an arrangement satisfactory to the city
has been made for the payment of such debts or obligations. It shall be the
applicant's responsibility to provide evidence/proof that the taxes have been
paid.
10.3   Application.
      Each application for zoning or for an amendment or change to the existing
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be made in writing on an application
form available at the city, filed with the city, and shall be accompanied by
payment of the appropriate fee as established within
Appendix A-3 of this Ordinance. The application shall also be accompanied by
additional information/materials (i.e., plans, maps, exhibits, legal
description of property, information about proposed uses, proof of ownership,
and the like) as deemed necessary by the City Manager, or his/her designee, in
order to ensure that the request is understood.
10.4   Public hearing and notice.
      A.   For zoning/rezoning requests involving real property, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on each zoning
application, as per applicable state law (Texas Local Government Code Ch. 211,
as may be amended). For proposed changes to zoning district boundaries
(including rezoning requests), written notice of the public hearing to occur
before the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be sent to all owners of
property, as indicated by the most recently approved city tax roll, that is
located within the area of application and within 200 feet of any property
affected thereby, said written notice to be sent not less than ten days before
such hearing is held. Such notice may be served by using the last known address
as listed on the most recently approved tax roll and depositing the notice,
postage paid, in the United States mail.
      B.   For requests involving proposed changes to the text of the Zoning
Ordinance, notice of the Planning and Zoning Commission hearing shall be
accomplished by publishing the purpose, time and place of the public hearing in
the official newspaper of the city not less than 15 days prior to the date of
the public hearing. Changes in the Ordinance text which do not change zoning
district boundaries (i.e., which do not involve specific real property) do not
require written notification to individual property owners.
      C.   The city may, at its option, establish additional rules and
procedures for public notification of proposed zoning changes and/or
development proposals (e.g., site plans, plats, and the like) which may
include, but not be limited to, the posting of a sign(s) on any property that
is proposed for a zoning change and/or development by the applicant or its
agent(s). Adherence to such rules and procedures, if so established by the
city, shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall be required as
part of a zoning change and/or development application.
10.5   Failure to appear.
      Failure of the applicant or his/her representative to appear before the
Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of Commissioners for more than one
hearing without an approved delay by the City Manager, or his/her designee,
shall constitute sufficient grounds for the Planning and Zoning Commission or
the Board of Commissioners to table or deny the application unless the city is
notified in writing by the applicant at least 72 hours prior to the hearing.
10.6   Planning and Zoning Commission consideration and recommendation.
      A.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall function in accordance with
§
8 of this Ordinance.
      B.   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on a zoning/rezoning
request (including a proposed text amendment to the Zoning Ordinance). After
all public input has been received and the public hearing closed, the
Commission shall make its recommendations on the proposed zoning request
stating its findings, its overall evaluation of the request, and its assessment
regarding how the request relates to the city’s comprehensive plan. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may, on its own motion or at the applicant’s
request, defer its decision/recommendations (i.e., table the request) for not
more than 90 days from the time the public hearing was first opened, or until
it has had an opportunity to consider other information or proposed
modifications to the request which may have a direct bearing thereon. If the
Commission elects to table the request, such tabling shall specifically state
the time period of the tabling (i.e., cite the meeting date whereon the request
will reappear on the Commission’s agenda).
      C.   When the Commission is ready to act upon the zoning request, it may
recommend approval of the request as it was submitted by the applicant,
approval of the request subject to certain conditions (i.e., as in the case of
a planned development district or a specific use provision), or disapproval of
the request. If the Commission’s recommendation is to approve the request
(either as submitted or with additional conditions), then the request will be
automatically forwarded to the Board of Commissioners for a second public
hearing thereon (see § 10.8).
      D.   If the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends denial of the
zoning change request, it shall provide reasons to the applicant for the
denial, if requested by the applicant. The Planning and Zoning Chairperson
shall inform the applicant of the right to receive reasons for the denial.
10.7   (Reserved)
10.8   Consideration by Board of Commissioners.
      A.   Applications forwarded from the Planning and Zoning Commission to
the Board of Commissioners. Every application or proposal which is heard by the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall be automatically forwarded to the Board of
Commissioners for setting and holding of public hearing thereon. An application
which is recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval shall
be forwarded to the Board of Commissioners along with the Commission’s
favorable recommendation. An application which is recommended by the Planning
and Zoning Commission for denial shall be forwarded to the Board of
Commissioners along with the Commission’s reasons for denial, and ultimate
approval of the request by the Board of Commissioners will require a three-
fourths majority vote from the Board of Commissioners. No zoning change,
however, shall become effective until after the adoption of an ordinance for
same and its publication as required by law.
      B.   Board of Commissioners action on zoning/rezoning or text amendment
requests. After a public hearing is held before the Board of Commissioners
regarding the zoning application, the Board of Commissioners may approve the
request in whole or in part, deny the request in whole or in part, table the
application to a future meeting, or it may refer the application back to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for further study.
         1.   If the Board of Commissioners approves the request, then § 10.8.E
would apply.
         2.   If the Board of Commissioners denies the request, then no other
zoning application may be filed for all or part of the subject tract of land
(or for that portion of the Zoning Ordinance, in the case of a text amendment
request submitted by a property owner or citizen) for a waiting period of one
year following the denial.
            a.   The Board of Commissioners may, at its option, waive the one-
year waiting period if, after due consideration of the matter at a scheduled
and posted meeting, it is determined that denial of the request was based upon
erroneous or omitted information, or if substantial new information pertaining
to the request is discovered.
      C.   Board of Commissioners hearing and notice for zoning changes. Notice
of the Board of Commissioners public hearing for zoning/rezoning and for Zoning
Ordinance text amendment requests shall be given by publishing the purpose,
time and place of such hearing in the official newspaper of the city not less
than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing.
      D.   Three-fourths vote. A favorable vote of three-fourths of all members
of the Board of Commissioners shall be required to approve any change in zoning
when written objections are received from 20% of the area of the adjacent
landowners which comply with the provisions of Texas Local Government Code §
211.006 (commonly referred to as the "20% rule"). If a protest against such
proposed amendment, supplement or change has been filed with the City
Secretary, duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% or more, either of
the subject property and/or of property within 200 feet of the subject tract,
such amendments shall not become effective except by a three-fourths vote of
the Board of Commissioners.
      E.   Final approval and ordinance adoption. Upon approval of the zoning
request by the Board of Commissioners, the applicant shall submit all related
material with revisions, if necessary, to the city for the preparation of the
amending ordinance. A metes and bounds description of all property, a survey
(i.e., drawing) exhibit, and other appropriate exhibits that are determined
necessary by the City Manager, or his/her designee, must be submitted with the
zoning change request application. The zoning request shall be deemed approved
at the time the Board of Commissioners makes a decision to approve the request
as submitted or with certain conditions. However, the amending ordinance will
not be prepared or formally adopted (i.e., effective) until a correct
description and all required exhibits have been submitted to the City Manager,
or his/her designee.

§ 20 C/B - COMMERCIAL/BUSINESS DISTRICT.
20.1   General purpose and description.
      The C/B - Commercial/Business District is established to provide areas
for a mixture of nonresidential land uses including office, retail,
professional service, commercial and entertainment uses, as well as highway-
oriented uses, such as hotels, motels and restaurants, which should generally
be located along high-volume thoroughfares. The characteristics of each
development site should be designed in such a manner as to create an attractive
appearance from the thoroughfare (particularly along Interstate Highway 44,
State Highway 240, State Highway 267 and F.M. 369). Because these areas are
major thoroughfare entry points into Burkburnett, emphasis has been placed upon
building arrangement, setbacks, parking and landscape treatment, which are
elements that tend to influence the visual appeal of the city as viewed from
the highway and which may help to attract visitors and new businesses to the
community. It is the intent of the C/B Zoning District to create a vibrant and
attractive first impression of the community.
20.2   Permitted uses.
      A.   1.   Those uses specified in §

shall be 30 inches tall (within two years of planting, if a landscaped hedge).
20.5   Special requirements.
      A.   Site plan review. Review and approval of a site plan by the Planning
and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners (in accordance with §
31) shall be required for any tract/lot within the C/B district. No certificate
of occupancy shall be issued unless all construction and development conforms
to the site plan as approved by the Board of Commissioners.
      B.   Building façade (i.e., elevation) plans shall be submitted for
review and approval along with the site plan. Façade plans shall clearly show
how the building(s) will look, especially as viewed from the major thoroughfare

than 10% of the lot or tract is used for the open storage of products,
materials, or equipment (see §
30 for additional screening requirements).
         3.   Certain “low risk industrial/manufacturing” or “high risk or
hazardous industrial” uses may be allowed by specific use provision only. In
this district, "high risk or hazardous industrial use" means any industrial use
whose operation, in the opinion of the City Manager (or his/her designee) and/
or the Fire Chief, involves a much higher than average risk to public health
and safety. These uses include, but are not limited to, facilities where
significant amounts of radiation, radioactive materials, highly toxic chemicals
or substances, or highly combustible or explosive materials are present, used,
produced, stored and/or disposed of.
         4.   Such uses as may be allowed by specific use provisions, §
26.

§ 22 (RESERVED).
§ 23 OVERLAY AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
Overlay and special prefix districts shall be used in conjunction with base
zoning districts where it is appropriate to do so. In the use of the following
overlay zoning classifications, the base district shall remain in effect as it
is already in existence unless changed by zoning amendment and in accordance
with the provisions of §
10. New base districts or changes in existing base districts may be requested
at the same time overlay or special prefix districts are requested.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 24 PD - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
24.1   General purpose and description.
      A.   The Board of Commissioners of the City of Burkburnett, Texas, after
public hearing and proper notice to all parties affected and after
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, may authorize the
creation of a Planned Development Overlay District.
      B.   The Planned Development (PD) District is a district which
accommodates planned associations of uses developed as integral land use units
such as industrial districts, office parks, retail/commercial or service
centers, shopping centers, residential developments having a mixture of housing
options (e.g., single-family, multi-family, duplex, and the like), or any
appropriate combination of uses which may be planned, developed or operated as
integral land use units either by a single owner or a combination of owners. A
PD District may be used to permit new or innovative concepts in land
utilization not permitted by other zoning districts in this Ordinance. While
greater flexibility is given to allow special conditions or restrictions which
would not otherwise allow the development to occur, procedures are established
herein to ensure against misuse of the increased flexibility.
24.2   Permitted uses.
      A.   An application for a PD District shall specify the base zoning
district upon which the PD is based, and the use or the combination of uses
proposed (particularly if any of the proposed uses are not allowed by right in
the base zoning district). In selecting a base zoning district, the uses
allowed in the base district must be similar or compatible with those proposed
for the PD. PD designations shall not be attached to SUP requirements. Specific
use provisions allowed in a base zoning district are allowed in a PD only if
specifically identified at the time of PD approval, and if specifically cited
as an “additional use” (i.e., to those allowed by right in the base zoning
district) in the ordinance establishing the PD.
      B.   In the case of residential PD Districts, the proposed lot sizes
shall be no smaller than the lot sizes allowed in the base zoning district for
each type of housing (e.g., single-family, duplex, and the like) except for
minor changes in a small percentage of the lots in order to provide improved
design or flexibility in the layout of the subdivision.
24.3   Planned development requirements.
      A.   Development requirements for each separate PD District shall be set
forth in the amending ordinance granting the PD District and shall include, but
may not be limited to: uses, density, lot area, lot width, lot depth, yard
depths and widths, building height, building elevations, coverage, floor area
ratio, parking, access, screening, landscaping, accessory buildings, signs,
lighting, project phasing or scheduling, management associations, and other
requirements as the Board of Commissioners and Planning and Zoning Commission
may deem appropriate.
      B.   In the PD district, uses shall conform to the standards and
regulations of the base zoning district to which it is most similar. The base
zoning district shall be stated in the granting ordinance. All applications to
the city shall list all requested deviations from the standard requirements set
forth throughout this Ordinance (applications without this list will be
considered incomplete). The Planned Development district shall conform to all
other regulations of the base zoning district, as well as all other sections of
the Zoning Ordinance, unless specifically changed or excluded in the ordinance
establishing the PD.
      C.   The ordinance granting a PD district shall include a statement as to
the purpose and intent of the PD granted therein. A specific list is required
of modifications in each district or districts and general statement citing the
reason for the PD request.
      D.   The minimum acreage for a planned development request shall be ten
acres.
24.4   In establishing a Planned Development District in accordance with this
section, the Board of Commissioners shall approve and file as part of the
amending ordinance appropriate plans and standards for each Planned Development
District. To facilitate understanding of the request during the review and
public hearing process, the concurrent submission of a concept plan for a
proposed nonresidential, multi-family or manufactured (mobile) home project, or
a preliminary plat for a proposed residential (i.e., single- or two-family)
project, shall be required along with the PD zoning application. A detailed
site plan may be submitted in lieu of the concept plan (or a final plat in lieu
of the preliminary plat, see the Subdivision Ordinance for submission
requirements) if the applicant prefers to do so, and if the applicant wishes to
expend the resources/funds necessary to prepare a complete detailed site plan
(or final plat) submission (i.e., detailed engineering/architectural plans, and
the like; see §
31).
      A.   Concept plan (or preliminary plat). This plan shall be submitted by
the applicant at the time of the PD request (for exceptions, see § 24.5). The
plan shall show the applicant's intent for the use of the land within the
proposed Planned Development District in a graphic manner and, as may be
required, supported by written documentation of proposals and standards for
development. The city may prepare application form(s) which further describe
and explain the following requirements:
         1.   Residential preliminary plat. A preliminary plat shall be
submitted with any residential PD zoning request for a development comprised of
single-family (detached or attached) or two-family (duplex) dwellings on
individually platted lots, and shall show general uses, phasing of the
development, access, thoroughfares, alleys (if proposed), preliminary lot
arrangements, proposed densities, proposed screening, landscaped or private
amenity areas, project scheduling, and other pertinent development data. (See
the Subdivision Ordinance for application procedures and requirements for a
preliminary plat submission.)
         2.   Nonresidential concept plan. A concept plan shall be submitted
with any nonresidential, multi-family, or manufactured (mobile) home PD zoning
request, and shall clearly show all pertinent aspects of the type and nature of
the proposed development. The concept plan shall show the types of use(s)
proposed; access, topography and boundaries of the PD area; existing physical
features of the site; existing and proposed streets, alleys, easements and lot
lines; location of existing or proposed public facilities; building heights and
locations; parking areas and ratios; fire lanes; screening and landscaped
areas; project phasing and scheduling; and other pertinent development data to
adequately describe the proposed development.
            a.   A detailed site plan shall be submitted for approval (in
accordance with Subsection B. below, and with §
31 of this Ordinance) within one year from the approval date of the concept
plan for all or some portion/lot of the planned development covered by the
overall concept plan. If a detailed site plan is not submitted within one year,
then the concept plan may be subject to review by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the Board of Commissioners to determine its continued validity.
If the city determines that the concept plan is no longer valid or that the
proposed development is no longer viable, then a new concept plan (along with a
zoning application to amend the PD ordinance and its accompanying concept plan)
must be submitted for review and approval prior to detailed site plan review/
approval (and any subsequent issuance of a building permit) for any portion of
the PD district.
      B.   Site plan (detailed). Submission and approval of the detailed site
plan shall be in accordance with §
31 of this Ordinance, and shall accompany an application for planned
development zoning if the applicant prefers to submit the detailed site plan in
lieu of the required concept plan. The detailed site plan will establish the
final plans for development of the Planned Development District (or any
portion/lot thereof), and it shall substantially conform to the site layout and
development data approved on the concept plan (adopted along with the PD
ordinance). If a concept plan was previously approved for the overall PD
District, then a detailed site plan (along with the required engineering/
architectural site construction plans) may be submitted for only the sections/
lots that are proposed for immediate development rather than for the entire PD.
If no concept plan was approved with the ordinance establishing the PD, then a
detailed site plan (along with the required engineering/architectural site
construction plans) must be submitted for the entire PD, even though only
portions of it are proposed for immediate development.
         For any single- or two-family residential district (AG, SF-15, SF-10,
SF-6, R-1, R-2 or MF), a preliminary plat shall qualify as the detailed site
plan.
24.5   Approval process and procedure.
      A.   The procedure for establishing a Planned Development Zoning District
shall follow the procedures for zoning amendments as set forth in § 10 of this
Ordinance. This procedure shall be expanded to include concurrent consideration
and approval (or denial) of the concept plan (or preliminary plat, for a
residential PD) or the detailed site plan (or final plat, for a residential PD)
which is submitted along with the PD zoning request application. The public
hearings conducted for, and the subsequent actions taken upon, the PD zoning
request shall also include the accompanying concept plan/preliminary plat or
detailed site plan/final plat.
      B.   The ordinance establishing the Planned Development Zoning District
shall not be approved (or adopted) until the accompanying concept plan or
detailed site plan is approved by the Board of Commissioners, and until all
other procedural requirements set forth in §
10 are satisfied.
24.6   When a zoning request for a Planned Development District is being
considered, a written report from the City Manager (or his/her designee)
discussing the project’s impact upon planning, engineering, water utilities,
electric, sanitation, building inspection, tax, police, fire and traffic, as
well as written comments from applicable public agencies (such as the school
district and/or utility companies), may be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission prior to the Commission making any recommendations to the Board of
Commissioners. In the event written comments and advisement are not forthcoming
in a reasonable amount of time, the Commission may, at its discretion, make a
recommendation to the Board of Commissioners without said comments or
advisement.
24.7   All Planned Development Zoning Districts approved in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance in its original form, or by subsequent amendments
thereto, shall be prefixed by a “PD” designation and assigned a unique
identification number (e.g., PD-1, PD-2, PD-3, and so on), and shall also be
referenced on the zoning district map. A list of such planned development
districts, showing the uses permitted and any other special stipulations of
each PD district, shall be maintained by the city.

(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 26 SUP - SPECIFIC USE PROVISIONS.
26.1   Specific uses.
      The purpose of this overlay district is to allow certain uses within base
zoning districts that, under most circumstances, would not be compatible with
other permitted uses but with certain conditions and development restrictions
may be compatible.
      The Board of Commissioners by an affirmative vote may, after public
hearing and proper notice (in accordance with the procedures set forth in §
10) to all parties affected, and after recommendations from the Planning and
Zoning Commission that the uses are in general conformance with the intent of
the comprehensive plan and with general objectives of the city, and containing
such requirements and safeguards as are necessary to protect adjoining
property, authorize certain uses by a Specific Use Provision (SUP). As a zoning
action, issuance of an SUP shall only apply to real property (i.e., shall not
be attached to any person, business entity, and the like), shall not be
transferred from one property to another (i.e., shall not move if a business
operation relocates), and shall not expire without proper zoning action to
rescind the SUP (i.e., change the zoning to remove the SUP, with appropriate
public notification, public hearing, and the like).
      A zoning application for an SUP shall be accompanied by a metes and
bounds description and a survey (i.e., drawing) exhibit showing the property
for which the SUP is being requested, and by a site plan (see §
31) drawn to scale and showing the general arrangement of the project, together
with essential requirements such as off-street parking facilities; size,
height, construction materials, and locations of buildings and the uses to be
permitted; location and construction of signs; means of ingress and egress to
public streets; the type of visual screening such as walls, plantings and
fences; and the relationship of the intended use to all existing properties and
land uses in all directions to a minimum distance of 200 feet. The city shall
make available application forms specifying drawing requirements. The City
Manager (or his/her designee), Planning and Zoning Commission or Board of
Commissioners may require additional information or drawings (such as building
floor plans), operating data and expert evaluation or testimony concerning the
location, function and characteristics of any building or use proposed. The
site plan shall be reviewed and approved along with the SUP zoning application,
and in accordance with §
31.
26.2   Specific use provision regulations.
      A.   In recommending that a specific use provision for the premises under
consideration be granted, the city shall determine that such uses are
harmonious and adaptable to building structures and uses of abutting property
and other property in the vicinity of the premises under consideration, and
shall make recommendations as to requirements for the paving of streets, alleys
and sidewalks, means of ingress and egress to public streets, provisions for
drainage, adequate off-street parking, screening and open space, heights of
structures, and compatibility of buildings. In approving a requested SUP, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners may consider any
or all of the following:
         1.   The use is harmonious and compatible with surrounding existing
uses or proposed uses;
         2.   The activities requested by the applicant are normally associated
with the permitted uses in the base district;
         3.   The nature of the use is reasonable;
         4.   Any negative impact on the surrounding area has been mitigated;
and/or
         5.   That any additional conditions specified ensure that the intent
of the district purposes are being upheld.
      B.   In granting a specific use provision, the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the Board of Commissioners may impose conditions which shall be
complied with by the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be
issued by the Building Official, or his/her designee, for use of the building
on such property pursuant to such specific use provision and such conditions
precedent to the granting of the certificate of occupancy. Any special
conditions shall be set forth in writing by the Board of Commissioners prior to
issuance of the certificate of occupancy, and shall be incorporated into the
amending ordinance establishing the SUP.
      C.   No specific use provision shall be granted unless the applicant,
owner and grantee of the specific use provision shall be willing to accept and
agree to be bound by and comply with the written requirements or conditions of
the specific use provision, as incorporated into the amending ordinance
establishing the SUP, and as reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
approved by the Board of Commissioners.
      D.   A building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be applied for
and secured within one year from the time of granting the specific use
provision, provided however, that the Board of Commissioners may authorize an
extension of up to one additional year. After the one-year period (and the
extension, if such has been granted by the Board of Commissioners) has elapsed,
the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners may review
the site plan for continued validity and compliance. If the site plan is
determined to be invalid or no longer viable, then the applicant/property owner
(s) must submit a new or revised site plan for approval prior to any
construction or to application for a building permit for the area designated
for the specific use provision. The new site plan must be resubmitted for
review and approval in accordance with §
31. If building construction/use of an SUP has not commenced within a
reasonable amount of time after one year, then the Board of Commissioners, at
its option, may initiate proceedings to rescind said SUP for lack of use.
      E.   No building, premise, or land used under a specific use provision
may be enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise significantly
changed unless an amended specific use provision is granted for such
enlargement, modification, structural alteration, or change.
         Minor changes or alterations may be approved by the City Manager, or
his/her designee.
      F.   The Zoning Board of Adjustments (ZBA) shall not have jurisdiction to
hear, review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with
respect to the specific land use designated by any specific use provision.
      G.   When the Board of Commissioners authorizes granting of a specific
use provision, the zoning district map shall be amended according to its legend
to indicate that the affected area has conditional and limited uses, and said
amendment is to indicate the appropriate zoning district for the approved use
and prefixed by a "SUP", or "S" designation followed by the identification
number assigned to that particular SUP (e.g., S-1, S-2, S-3, and so on).
         A list of all issued SUPs, showing the uses allowed and any other
special stipulations of each SUP, shall be maintained by the city.
26.3   Use regulations.
      A.   Uses allowed by SUP are specified in §
27.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
ARTICLE IV. USE REGULATIONS
§ 27 USE REGULATIONS (CHARTS).
27.1   A.   The use of land and/or buildings shall be in accordance with those
listed in the following use charts. No land or building shall hereafter be used
and no building or structure shall be erected, altered, or converted other than
for those uses specified in the zoning district in which it is located. The
legend for interpreting the permitted uses in the use charts is:
   X   Designates use permitted in the zoning district indicated.
(Blank)   Designates use prohibited (i.e., not allowed) in the zoning district
indicated.
   S   Designates use may be allowed in the zoning district indicated by
specific use provision (also see §
26).
      See definitions in the
Appendix (A-1) for further description of uses identified with an asterisk (*).
   B.   If a use is not listed, it is not allowed in any zoning district.
   C.   Use chart organization.
      1.   Primary residential uses (Use Chart § 27.2).
      2.   Accessory and incidental uses (Use Chart § 27.3).
      3.   Utility and service uses (Use Chart § 27.4).
      4.   Recreational and entertainment uses (Use Chart § 27.5).
      5.   Education, institutional, public, and special uses (Use Chart §
27.6).
      6.   Transportation related uses (Use Chart § 27.7).
      7.   Automobile and related uses (Use Chart § 27.8).
      8.   Office and professional uses (Use Chart § 27.9).
      9.   Retail and related service uses (Use Chart § 27.10).
      10.   Commercial uses (Use Chart § 27.11).
      11.   Industrial and related uses (Use Chart § 27.12).
   D.   Classification of new/unlisted uses. It is recognized that new types of
land use will develop, and forms of land use not presently anticipated may seek
to locate in the City of Burkburnett. In order to provide for such changes and
contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new
or unlisted form of land use in the use charts shall be made as follows:
      1.   Initiation.
         a.   A person, city department, the Planning and Zoning Commission, or
the Board of Commissioners may propose zoning amendments to regulate new and
previously unlisted uses.
         b.   A person requesting the addition of a new or unlisted use shall
submit to the City Manager, or his/her designee, all information necessary for
the classification of the use, including but not limited to:
            (1)   The nature of the use and whether the use involves dwelling
activity, sales, services, or processing;
            (2)   The type of product sold or produced under the use;
            (3)   Whether the use has enclosed or open storage and the amount
and nature of the storage;
            (4)   Anticipated employment typically anticipated with the use;
            (5)   Transportation requirements;
            (6)   The nature and time of occupancy and operation of the
premises;
            (7)   The off-street parking and loading requirements;
            (8)   The amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic materials and
vibration likely to be generated; and
            (9)   The requirements for public utilities such as sanitary sewer
and water and any special public services that may be required.
      2.   The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall refer the question
concerning any new or unlisted use to the Planning and Zoning Commission
requesting a recommendation as to the zoning classification into which such use
should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be
accompanied by the statement of facts in Subsection b. above. An amendment to
this Ordinance shall be required as prescribed by §
10.
      3.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the nature and
described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses
permitted in the various districts and determine the zoning district or
districts within which such use is most similar and should be permitted.
      4.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit its findings and
recommendations to the Board of Commissioners as to the classification proposed
for any new or unlisted use. The Board of Commissioners shall approve or
disapprove the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission or make
such determination concerning the classification of such use as is determined
appropriate based upon its findings. If approved, the new or unlisted use shall
be amended in the use charts of the Zoning Ordinance according to §
10 (i.e., following notification and public hearing, and the like).
      5.   Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted by the City
Manager, or his/her designee, as those of a similar use. When a determination
of the appropriate zoning district cannot be readily ascertained, the same
criteria outlined above (Subsection b.) shall be followed for determination of
the appropriate district. The decision of the City Manager, or his/her
designee, may be appealed according to the process outlined in Subsections 2.
through 4. above.

ARTICLE V. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 28 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
28.1   Purpose.
      To secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to lessen
congestion on public streets; to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation; to conserve the value of buildings; and to encourage the most
appropriate use of land. Minimum off-street parking and loading shall be
provided as set forth in the following schedules and provisions.
28.2   Residential districts; special off-street parking provisions.
      A.   Required off-street parking shall be provided on the same site as
the use it is to serve.
      B.   In the SF-6, SF-10 and SF-15 residential zoning districts (and in
the R-1 and R-2 districts for any single-family, two-family, patio home,
townhome, triplex or quadriplex dwelling unit), all required vehicle parking
shall be on a suitably paved parking surface. All driveways and approaches to
parking spaces shall be similarly paved.
      C.   In the SF-6, SF-10 and SF-15 residential zoning districts (and in
the R-1 and R-2 districts for any single-family, two-family, patio home,
townhome, triplex or quadriplex dwelling unit), no permanent storage of heavy
load vehicles (see definition for “heavy load vehicle”) shall be permitted
between the front of the primary structure and the front property line.
28.3   Nonresidential and MF districts; special off-street parking provisions.
      A.   To prevent nuisance situations, all parking area lighting shall be
designed and operated so as not to reflect or shine on adjacent properties.
      B.   For safety and fire-fighting purposes, free access through to
adjacent nonresidential parking areas shall be provided in accordance with §
28.10.
      C.   All off-street parking, maneuvering, loading and storage areas shall
be paved in accordance with the parking lot paving requirements in the city's
Code of Ordinances (i.e., no parking shall be permitted on grass, within
landscaped areas, or on other unimproved surfaces). Parking spaces shall be
permanently and clearly identified by stripes, buttons, tiles, curbs, barriers,
or other approved methods. Non-permanent type marking, such as paint, shall be
regularly maintained to ensure continuous clear identification of the space.
      D.   Each standard off-street surface parking area shall be designed in
accordance with the standards as shown on Illustration 10 in
Appendix A-4 for overall layout and design. Specific parking space sizes,
exclusive of aisles, driveways and maneuvering areas shall be in accordance
with the following minimum sizes:
         1.   Standard - 9 feet x 18 feet.
         2.   Compact - 9 feet x 16 feet; limited to a maximum of 10% of the
required number of parking spaces; must be clearly designated with appropriate
signage.
         3.   Parallel - 8 feet x 22 feet.
      E.   All parking and loading spaces, and vehicle sales areas on private
property, shall have a vehicle stopping device (e.g., curb, wheel stop, and the
like) installed so as to prevent parking of motor vehicles in any required
landscaped areas, to prevent vehicles from hitting buildings, to protect public
and/or private utility structures/facilities, and to prevent parked vehicles
from overhanging a public right-of-way line, public sidewalk, or adjacent
private property. An extra-wide sidewalk on private property may be permitted
so as to allow encroachment of vehicle overhang while maintaining an
unobstructed four-foot minimum sidewalk width. The requirement shall apply only
where spaces are adjacent to the walks, right-of-way, and required landscaping.
Parking shall not be permitted to encroach upon the public right-of-way in any
case. For new construction only, all vehicle maneuvering shall take place on-
site. No public right-of-way shall be used for backing or maneuvering into or
from a parking space, or for circulation within the parking lot.
      F.   In all nonresidential and multi-family zoning districts, the
perimeter of all parking lots and driveways shall be provided with concrete
curbs or other means to control traffic.
      G.   Refuse storage facilities placed in a parking lot shall not be
located in a designated parking or loading space. Each refuse facility shall be
located so as to facilitate pickup by refuse collection agencies.
      H.   Handicap parking space(s) shall be provided according to building
codes, state laws, and requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA).
      I.   In all nonresidential and multi-family zoning categories, designated
parking and loading areas shall not be used for the repair, storage,
dismantling or servicing (except for normal maintenance of a private vehicle)
of vehicles or equipment, or for the storage of materials or supplies, or for
any other use in conflict with the designated parking and loading areas (i.e.,
advertising or open storage of raw materials).
      J.   To ensure that all requirements set forth in this section are
carried forward, it will be the responsibility of the owner of the parking area
to adequately maintain the facility. All off-street parking areas shall be kept
free of trash, debris, vehicle repair operation or display and advertising
uses. At no time after initial approval of the parking area layout can changes
be made in the location and number of provided spaces without approval of the
City Manager or his/her designee.
28.4   Off-street loading space; all districts.
      A.   All retail, commercial, industrial and service structures shall
provide and maintain off-street facilities for receiving and loading
merchandise, supplies and materials within a building or on the lot or tract.
All drives and approaches shall provide adequate space and clearances to allow
for the maneuvering of trucks on-site (i.e., no backing or maneuvering may
occur on a street or public alley). Each site shall provide a designated on-
site loading and maneuvering area for trucks (see Illustration 2 in
Appendix A-4). Such off-street loading space may be adjacent to (but not any
portion of) a public alley or private service drive, or it may consist of a
truck berth within the structure. Such off-street loading space or truck berth
shall consist of a minimum area of 10 feet x 45 feet, and such spaces or berths
shall be provided in accordance with the following schedule:
 
Total Square Feet of Gross Floor Area in Minimum Required Spaces or Berths
Structure
0 to 10,000 square feet                  None
10,001 to 50,000 square feet             1
50,001 to 100,000 square feet            2
100,001 to 200,000 square feet           3
Each additional 100,000 square feet      1 additional
 
      B.   In all zoning districts except Industrial, loading docks or service/
delivery entrances shall not be constructed facing any public street, and shall
not be visible from any public street. In the Industrial District, loading
docks or service/delivery entrances (which may include overhead rolling steel
doors) may be constructed facing a public street if they are set back a minimum
of 75 feet from the right-of-way line of the street, and if they are visually
screened from the roadway (using a "line of sight" which is measured from a
vertical height of five feet at the right-of-way line of the roadway).
Screening shall be subject to the following standards:
         1.   Screening shall be a brick/masonry wall not less than ten feet in
height. An alternative form of screening (e.g., a tall, living screen/hedge)
may be approved on the site plan, provided that it will achieve the purpose and
intent of this subsection (i.e., opacity; ten-foot height; screening loading
areas from view of streets) within three years after planting (if a living
screen).
         2.   Screening shall be provided for a linear distance equal to the
length of the area where the loading docks/service areas are exposed to the
public street.
      C.   Loading docks for any establishment which customarily receives goods
between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. and is adjacent to a residential
use or district shall be designed and constructed so as to enclose the loading
operation on three sides, in order to reduce the effects of the noise of the
operation on adjacent residences.
      D.   Kindergartens, elementary schools, day schools, and similar child
training and care establishments shall provide one paved off-street pedestrian
loading and unloading space for an automobile on a through, "circular" drive
for each ten students cared for (excluding child care in a residence). An
additional lane shall also be required to allow passby or through traffic to
move while automobiles waiting or parked to pick up children occupy loading/
unloading areas.
28.5   Parking access from a public street; all districts.
      A.   In the approval of a detailed site plan, design consideration shall
be given to providing entrance/exit drives which extend into the site to
provide adequate queuing of vehicles on the site.
      B.   In all districts (except single-family and duplex zoning districts)
building plans shall provide for entrance/exit drive(s) appropriately designed
and located to minimize traffic congestion or conflict within the site and with
adjoining public streets as approved by the City Manager, or his/her designee.
         1.   Based upon analysis by the city, if projected volumes of traffic
entering or leaving a development are likely to interfere with the projected
peak traffic flow volumes on adjoining streets, additional right-of-way and
paving in the form of a deceleration lane or turn lane may be required of a
developer in order to reduce such interference.
         2.   The determination of additional right-of-way or paving
requirements shall be made at the time the final site plan is submitted for
approval.
      C.   Vehicular access to non-residential uses shall not be permitted from
alleys serving residential areas.
      D.   Parking space configuration, location, arrangement, size and
circulation in all districts shall be constructed according to Illustration 10
in
Appendix A-4.
28.6   Parking requirements based upon use.

one seat equals eight square feet of floor area occupied by such seating area
(includes aisles).
      C.   Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be
construed to be the next higher whole number.
      D.   The parking space requirements for a new or unlisted use not
specifically mentioned herein shall be the same as required for a use of
similar nature. If the proposed use is not similar to any of the uses listed
herein, a determination shall be made by the City Manager, or his/her designee,
in accordance with the requirements for the most closely related use specified
in this section.
      E.   Whenever a building or use is changed or enlarged in floor area,
number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise,
to create a need for an increase of 10% or more in the number of existing
parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement
or change.
      F.   For buildings which have mixed uses within the same structure (such
as retail and office), the parking requirement shall be calculated for the most
intensive use. In cases where the design of the interior of the structure is
not practical for alteration, the parking requirement may be calculated for
each use within a structure for buildings over 20,000 square feet.
      G.   Shared parking may be allowed in the case of mixed uses (different
buildings) under the following conditions: up to 50% of the parking spaces
required for a theater or other place of evening entertainment (after 6:00
p.m.), or for a church, may be provided and used jointly by banks, offices, and
similar uses not normally open, used, or operated during evening hours. Shared
parking must be on the same parking lot. Reduction due to shared parking shall
be determined by the City Manager, or his/her designee. To assure retention of
the shared parking spaces, each property owner shall properly draw and execute
a document expressing the same and shall file this agreement with the City of
Burkburnett.
      H.   Compact car spaces. In the C/B and I Districts only, compact car
parking spaces may be permitted when approved as part of a detailed site plan
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners, provided
one of the following conditions apply:
         1.   Where it is necessary to preserve the natural landscape and
native trees, a maximum of 10% of required parking may be designated for
compact cars.
         2.   On parking lots larger than 50 spaces involving large industrial
buildings or large offices and where there is only one tenant, a maximum of 10%
of the required parking may be for compact cars.
         3.   On parking lots larger than 50 spaces involving a shopping
center, a maximum of 10% of the required parking may be for compact cars.
28.8   Location of parking spaces.
      All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot with
the building or use served, except as follows:
      A.   Where an increase in the number of spaces is required by a change or
enlargement of use or where such spaces are provided collectively or used
jointly by two or more buildings or establishments, the required spaces may be
located not to exceed 500 feet from any nonresidential building served.
      B.   In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the
same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively
or jointly provided and used, approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and the Board of Commissioners is required according to the following criteria:
         1.   Off-site parking may be permitted on an immediately contiguous
lot or tract, or on a lot or tract within 150 feet of such building or
structure provided:
            a.   That a permanent, irrevocable easement of the parking
facilities in favor of the premises to be benefitted shall be dedicated and
recorded as a condition of such use; or
            b.   That a long-term remote parking lease agreement be provided
upon approval by the city as a condition of such use.
28.9   Use of required parking spaces, non-residential districts.
      Required off-street parking and loading spaces shall be used only for
these respective purposes and shall not be used for refuse containers, cart
corrals, recycling kiosks, signs or sign support structures, telecommunications
towers or support structures, storage or permanent display of boats, trailers,
campers, motor vehicles or other goods, materials, or products for sale/lease/
rent.
28.10   Fire lanes.
      A.   Fire lanes shall be provided in all multi-family (and in some
single-family attached), manufactured home, and nonresidential developments, as
required by the city’s Fire Code and subject to review and approval by the Fire
Chief. Fire lanes shall be a minimum width of 24 feet of paving, and shall have
a minimum inside turning radius at curves of 20 feet, or as required by the
Fire Code. The minimum overhead vertical clearance over fire lanes shall be 14
feet.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 29 ACCESSORY BUILDING AND USE REGULATIONS.
29.1   In a single-family or multi-family district, an accessory building is a
subordinate or incidental building, attached to or detached from the main
building, not used for commercial purposes and not rented. Accessory buildings
shall be located toward the rear portion of the property.
29.2   Reserved.
29.3   Accessory dwelling units in the “AG” district shall be allowed as an
incidental residential use of a building on the same lot as the main dwelling
unit and used by the same person or persons of the immediate family, and shall
meet the following standards:
      A.   The accessory dwelling unit must be constructed to the rear of the
main dwelling, separate from the main dwelling.
      B.   The accessory dwelling unit may be constructed only with the
issuance of a building permit, and shall be constructed out of the same
material as the main structure.
      C.   The accessory dwelling unit may not be sold separately from sale of
the entire property, including the main dwelling unit, and shall not be sublet.
      D.   Setback requirements shall be the same as for the main structure.
      E.   Accessory dwellings are not permitted without the main or primary
structure.
29.4   Accessory dwellings (including garage/accessory dwellings and detached
units) may be permitted in residential zoning districts (see regulations for
the specific district, and the use charts, § 27), and shall conform to the
height limitations of the main structure. No such accessory dwelling or
quarters shall be used or occupied as a place of abode or residence by anyone
other than a bona fide caretaker, servant or farm worker actually and regularly
employed by the land owner or occupant of the main building, or a guest or
family member of the owner/occupant. Only one accessory dwelling unit (i.e.,
garage/accessory dwelling, servants’/caretaker’s quarters, and the like) shall
be allowed on any lot within a residential zoning district, and they shall be
clearly incidental to the primary use. These accessory living structures shall
not, in any case, be leased or sold.
29.5   Area regulations for accessory buildings in residential and multi-family
districts.
      A.   Size of yards.
         1.   Front yard. Detached accessory buildings shall be prohibited in
front of the main building.
         2.   Side or rear yard. There shall be a side/rear setback not less
than five feet from any side/rear lot line or alley line for any accessory
building, provided that such building is separated from the main building by a
minimum distance of ten feet and provided that such accessory building is no
taller than eight feet in height (buildings taller than eight feet shall
observe the same setback as the main building). In the case of an accessory
building being closer than ten feet to the main building, the minimum side/rear
yard requirements for the main building shall be observed. Accessory buildings
adjacent to a side/rear street shall have a side/rear yard not less than 15
feet. Garages or carports located and arranged so as to be entered from the
side/rear yard shall have a minimum setback of the required yard for the main
building or 20 feet, whichever is greater.
         3.   Carports shall be measured from the posts supporting the roof
nearest to the street or alley (see Illustration 4 in
Appendix A-4).
         4.   Accessory buildings are not permitted without a main structure.
         5.   Accessory buildings shall not exceed one story in height, unless
otherwise allowed in the specific zoning district. Garage/accessory dwelling
units are allowed up to 35 feet in height in some residential districts.
Garage/accessory dwelling units up to two stories may be allowed in certain
other districts (see §
27) by SUP if there is no adverse impact upon adjacent properties.
         6.   Metal accessory buildings less than 240 square feet are permitted
but shall not be used as an enclosed parking area or garage.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 30 FENCING, WALLS AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
30.1   Purpose.
      To encourage the most appropriate use of land and conserve and protect
the privacy and value of adjacent permitted uses, regulations are prescribed
for the location and type of various screening devices to be used when required
in the various zoning districts or in this section in accordance with the
following standards.
30.2   Screening of nonresidential, multi-family areas and manufactured/mobile
home parks.
      A.   In the event that multi-family, nonresidential uses, or
manufactured/mobile home parks side or back upon a single-family (e.g., AG, SF-
15, SF-10, SF-6 or R-1) or residential PD District, or in the event that any
nonresidential district sides or backs upon a multi-family or manufactured home
district (e.g., MF or R-2), a solid brick/masonry screening wall of not less
than six feet nor more than eight feet in height shall be erected on the
property line separating these districts. The purpose of the screening wall or
fence is to provide a visual and protective barrier between the properties.
         1.   The owner of the property in the higher intensity district (i.e.,
MF, C/B, I, and the like) shall be responsible for building and maintaining the
required wall on the property line dividing the property from the single-family
or lower intensity zoning district.
         2.   Any screening wall or fence required under the provisions of this
section, under a specific use provision, Planned Development District, or other
requirement shall be constructed of masonry, reinforced concrete, or other
similar suitable permanent materials which do not contain openings. All wall or
fence openings shall be equipped with gates equal in height and screening
characteristics to the wall or fence.
         3.   Alternative equivalent screening may be approved through the site
plan approval process, §
31.
      B.   All required screening walls shall be equally finished on both sides
of the wall.
      C.   Open storage of materials, commodities or equipment (see §
27, zoning districts permitting outside storage), where such are allowed, shall
be screened with a minimum six-foot fence or wall. (See
Appendix A-1, definition of outside storage.)
      D.   In districts permitting open storage, screening shall be required
only for those areas used for open storage. A six-foot screening fence or wall
shall be provided and maintained at the property line adjacent to the area to
be screened by one (or a combination) of the following methods:
         1.   Solid masonry (brick, concrete block or concrete panels).
         2.   Chain link with solid landscape screening.
         3.   Wrought iron with solid landscape screening.
         4.   Alternate equivalent screening may be approved through the site
plan approval process under §
31.
         No outside storage may exceed the height of the fence. Outside storage
exceeding eight feet shall require a specific use provision.
      E.   Refuse storage areas which are not within a screened rear service
area and which are visible from a public right-of-way for all nonresidential,
multi-family and manufactured/mobile home park uses shall be visually screened
by a minimum six-foot solid masonry wall on at least three sides (see
Illustration 11 in
Appendix A-4 for refuse container enclosure diagrams). The fourth side, which
is to be used for garbage pickup service, may provide an optional gate to
secure the refuse storage area. Alternate equivalent screening methods may be
approved through the site plan approval process, §
31. Each refuse facility shall be located so as to facilitate pickup by refuse
collection agencies. Adequate reinforced paved areas shall be provided for
refuse facilities and their approaches for loading and unloading, as per
Illustration 11 in
Appendix A-4.
      F.   Plans and specifications for screening and/or fencing around ground-
mounted utility structures (e.g., transformers, natural gas regulating
stations, and the like) shall be approved in writing by the affected utility
company, and shall be submitted, along with an approval letter/document from
the utility company, to the City Manager (or his/her designee) for review and
approval prior to construction of said screening/fencing.
30.3   Fences in residential areas.
      A.   Any fence or wall located to the rear of the minimum required front
yard line shall not exceed eight feet in height.
      B.   Except as provided by Subsection C. below, no fence or wall shall be
permitted within the required front yard of any single-family or duplex
residential lot. No fence shall be erected in any front yard or side yard which
is adjacent to a public street. No residential fence shall be closer than 15
feet to a public street except in cases where the side or rear building line of
the yards on continuous corner lots adjoin the fence may be constructed out to
the property line of said side yard.
      C.   Decorative fences with openings not less than 50% of the fence area
and not exceeding 36 inches in height are permitted in front yards. Chain link,
woven wire mesh or similar materials are not considered decorative fencing.
      D.   All fences require permits.
      E.   No barbed wire or electrical fencing shall be allowed except as used
for farm or ranching purposes on undeveloped land over one acres in size.
      F.   Gates designed for vehicular access shall be set back from the
property line a minimum of 20 feet such that vehicles waiting to enter the
property are not standing/parking in the street.
      G.   Fences around swimming pools shall comply with the Standard Swimming
Pool Code and the City of Burkburnett’s codes/ordinances pertaining to same.
      H.   See §
32 for sight visibility requirements.
      I.   Special purpose fencing, such as fencing around tennis courts, is
permitted.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 31 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
31.1   Site plan review.
      A.   Purpose. This section establishes a site plan review process for
proposed nonresidential and multi-family residential developments. The purpose
of the review is to ensure efficient and safe land development, harmonious use
of land, compliance with appropriate design standards, safe and efficient
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, parking and loading, and adequate water
supply, drainage and storm water management, sanitary facilities, and other
utilities and services.
      B.   Applicability. Site plan review and approval shall be required for
the following:
         1.   Any nonresidential development (including a school or church
within a residential zoning district).
         2.   Any multi-family development or manufactured/mobile home park.
         3.   Any development with two or more buildings per platted lot.
         4.   Any planned development district or specific use provision
(public hearings may also be required, see §§
32 and
34).
         No building permit shall be issued for any of the above developments
until a site plan and all other required engineering/construction plans are
first approved by the city. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until
all construction and development conforms to the site plan and engineering/
construction plans, as approved by the city. A public hearing on a site plan is
not required unless a site plan is prepared in conjunction with a zoning
request for a planned development or an SUP.
      C.   Exemptions and exceptions. Site plan review shall not be required
for single-family (attached or detached) or two-family residential
developments, except as provided in Subsection B.4. above, unless the proposed
subdivision will include a private amenity/facility comprised of one or more
buildings (e.g., a private recreation/swimming facility, clubhouse, and the
like) or a golf course, or unless the proposed subdivision will have private
(i.e., not public) streets. In these instances, site plan submission and
approval (in accordance with this section) will be required for the private
amenity/facility, the golf course clubhouse/hospitality area, and the gated
(i.e., restricted access) entrances.
      D.   Site plan submission requirements. The site plan submission shall be
comprised of the following (all required items/information must be received by
the City Manager, or his/her designee, in order for a site plan/development
review submission to be considered complete—incomplete submissions will not be
reviewed until all deficient items/information has been received):
         1.   Application form (format to be provided by the city) signed by
the owner or his/her designated representative (if the applicant is not the
owner of the subject property, then he/she shall submit verification in the
form of a notarized statement that he/she is acting as an authorized agent for
the property owner).
         2.   Filing fee (as established within
Appendix A-3 of this Ordinance).
         3.   Verification that all taxes and assessments on the subject
property have been paid (see Subsection E. below).
         4.   Copies of the site plan (on 24 inch x 36 inch sheet, and drawn to
a known engineering scale that is large enough to be clearly legible), the
quantity of which shall be determined by the City Manager or his/her designee.
         5.   Complete sets of engineering/construction plans (including the
site plan and plat) for all site work and for all required public improvements
(e.g., water, wastewater, grading/storm drainage, streets, alleys, fire lanes
and hydrants, and the like), the quantity of which shall be determined by the
City Manager or his/her designee.
         6.   Preliminary plat/final plat submission (as per the Subdivision
Ordinance), if the property has not yet been platted, or a replat submission if
additional easements or rights-of-way will need to be established for the
proposed development.
         7.   Landscaping and irrigation plans, the quantity of which shall be
determined by the City Manager, or his/her designee.
         8.   Building façade (i.e., elevation) plans, the quantity of which
shall be determined by the City Manager, or his/her designee.
         9.   Any additional information/materials (i.e., plans, maps,
exhibits, legal description of property, information about proposed uses, and
the like) as deemed necessary by the City Manager, or his/her designee, in
order to ensure that the request is understood.
      E.   No person who owes delinquent taxes, delinquent paving assessments,
impact fees, or any other delinquent debts or obligations to the City of
Burkburnett, and which are directly attributable to a piece of property, shall
be allowed to submit an application for site plan/development review until the
taxes, assessments, debts, or obligations directly attributable to said
property and owed by the owner or previous owner thereof shall have been first
fully paid, or until an arrangement satisfactory to the city has been made for
the payment of such debts or obligations. It shall be the applicant's
responsibility to provide evidence or proof that the taxes have been paid.
      F.   Site plan details. The site plan and accompanying engineering/
construction plans shall contain sufficient information relative to site design
and construction to clearly show the extent of the proposed development/
construction, and shall include but not be limited to the following:
         1.    A site inventory analysis including major existing vegetation,
natural water courses, creeks or bodies of water, and an analysis of planned
changes in such natural features as a result of the development. This shall
include a delineation of any flood prone areas.
         2.   Any existing and proposed public/private streets and alleys;
building sites or lots; any areas reserved as parks, parkways, playgrounds,
utility easements or school sites; any proposed street widening and street
changes (i.e., median cuts and turn lanes); the points of ingress and egress
from existing/proposed streets; location and description of existing and
proposed utility services, including size of water and sewer mains and
laterals, and storm drainage structures (including grading); the location and
width for all driveway openings; topography at no more than two-foot contours;
and existing development on all abutting sites and the zoning classification
thereof.
         3.   Placement of all buildings on the site, showing the building
footprints and setback lines, and all property lines, street curb lines, alley
lines, easements, screening walls, signage, any service/delivery areas for
trucks, fire lanes, and parking areas (including parking space counts and a
schedule of parking ratios used for the various proposed uses).
         4.   A landscape plan showing turf areas, screening walls, ornamental
plantings, any existing wooded areas and trees to be planted, and irrigation
plans (if required).
         5.    Building façade (i.e., elevation) plans showing elevations with
any attached (i.e., wall-mounted) signage to be used, as determined appropriate
by the City Manager, or his/her designee.
         Provision of the above items shall conform to the principles and
standards of this Ordinance. To ensure the submission of adequate information,
the city is hereby empowered to maintain and distribute a separate list of
specific requirements for site plan review applications. Upon periodic review,
the City Manager (or his/her designee) shall have the authority to update such
requirements for site plan/development review applications.
      G.   Supplemental requirements. The city’s staff may require other
information and data for specific site plans. This data may include but is not
limited to geologic information, water yields, flood data and/or hydrological
studies, environmental information, traffic impact analysis, road capacities,
market information, economic data for the proposed development, hours of
operation, elevations and perspective drawings, lighting, and similar
information. Approval of a site plan may establish conditions for construction
based upon such information.
      H.   Principles and standards for site plan review and evaluation. The
following criteria have been set forth as a guide for evaluating the adequacy
of proposed development within the City of Burkburnett, and to ensure that all
developments are, to the best extent possible, constructed according to the
city’s codes and ordinances.
         The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall review the site plan for
compliance with all applicable city ordinances and with the comprehensive plan;
for harmony with surrounding uses and with long-range plans for the future
development of Burkburnett; for the promotion of the health, safety, order,
efficiency, and economy of the city; and for the maintenance of property values
and the general welfare.
         Site plan review and evaluation by the City Manager, or his/her
designee, shall be performed with respect to the following:
         1.   The site plan's compliance with all provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance and other ordinances of the City of Burkburnett, including but not
limited to off-street parking and loading, lighting, open space, and the
generation of objectionable smoke, fumes, noise, odors, dust, glare, vibration,
or heat.
         2.   The impact of the development relating to the preservation of
existing natural resources on the site and the impact on the natural resources
of the surrounding properties and neighborhood.
         3.   The relationship of the development to adjacent uses in terms of
harmonious design, setbacks, maintenance of property values, and any possible
negative impacts.
         4.   The provision of a safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation system.
         5.   The design and location of off-street parking and loading
facilities to ensure that all such spaces are usable and are safely and
conveniently arranged.
         6.   The sufficient width and suitable grade and location of streets
designed to accommodate prospective traffic and to provide access for fire
fighting and emergency equipment to buildings.
         7.   The coordination of streets so as to arrange a convenient system
consistent with the thoroughfare plan of the City of Burkburnett.
         8.   The use of landscaping and screening to provide adequate buffers
to shield lights, noise, movement, or activities from adjacent properties when
necessary, and to complement and integrate the design and location of buildings
into the overall site design.
         9.   Exterior lighting to ensure safe movement and for security
purposes, which shall be arranged so as to minimize glare and reflection upon
adjacent properties.
         10.   The location, size, and configuration of open space areas to
ensure that such areas are suitable for intended recreation and conservation
uses.
         11.   Protection and conservation of soils from erosion by wind or
water or from excavation or grading.
         12.   Protection and conservation of water courses and areas subject
to flooding.
         13.   The adequacy of water, drainage, sewerage facilities, solid
waste disposal, and other utilities necessary for essential services to
residents and occupants.
31.2   Approval process.
      A.   The City Manager (or his/her designee) shall review and evaluate all
site plan submissions, and shall make a recommendation to the Planning and
Zoning Commission to approve the site plan, to approve the site plan with
conditions or stipulations, or to deny the site plan for certain reasons. The
City Manager, or his/her designee, may prepare a written report/evaluation of
the site plan/development application, which may include background information
on the subject property, its zoning history, development and zoning patterns
surrounding the site, discussion of any issues or concerns, and a staff
recommendation as described above. The staff report/evaluation should be made
available to members of the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the meeting
date on which the application will be considered in order to allow time for
review and for site visitation, if necessary.
      B.   The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall schedule consideration
of the site plan on the regular agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission
within 30 days after the submission is received (or, in the case of an
incomplete submission, after the submission is deemed complete). The Planning
and Zoning Commission shall review the site plan and shall forward its
recommendation to approve the site plan, to approve the site plan with
conditions or stipulations, or to deny the site plan to the Board of
Commissioners. The site plan shall then be scheduled for consideration by the
Board of Commissioners at their next possible meeting. The Board of
Commissioners shall determine final approval or disapproval of all site plans.
      C.   Effect of site plan approval. If development of a lot with an
approved site plan has not commenced (i.e., a building permit has not been
applied for or issued) within one year of the date of final Board of
Commissioners approval of the site plan, then the site plan shall be deemed to
have expired. Resubmission of the site plan (i.e., following expiration as
described herein) shall be in accordance with site plan submission and review
procedures then in effect and shall be accompanied by all required items/
information (including payment of filing fees), and reconsideration of the site
plan shall take into account all changes to applicable ordinances which may
have occurred since prior approval of the site plan.
31.3   Revisions to the approved site plan.
      A.   Minor revisions/amendment. It is recognized that final architectural
and engineering design may necessitate minor changes in the approved site plan.
In such cases, the City Manager, or his/her designee, shall have the authority
to approve minor modifications to an approved site plan (which shall be
submitted as an “amended site plan” which substantially conforms to the
previously approved site plan), provided that such modifications do not
materially change traffic circulation, building location(s) on the site,
proximity of building(s) to nearby residential areas, the size or height (i.e.,
enlarge) of building(s), or any other conditions specifically attached as part
of the Board of Commissioners’ approval of the site plan. Submission materials
and requirements for approval of an amended site plan shall be as determined by
the City Manager or his/her designee.
      B.   Major revisions. In the event of revisions that are more extensive
in nature (i.e., do not conform to the description for minor amendments above),
a “revised site plan” must be resubmitted, reviewed by the City Manager (or
his/her designee), and reconsidered by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
the Board of Commissioners in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
section.
(Ord. 589, passed 4-17-00)
§ 32 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS.
32.1   A.   Measuring setbacks. All setback measurements shall be made in
accordance with Illustrations 6, 8 and 9 in
Appendix A-4.
      B.   Configuration of lots. Wherever possible, flag lots (i.e., lots with
minimal, or panhandle type, frontage) shall be avoided. Similarly, through
(i.e., double frontage) lots (particularly within residential zoning districts)
shall also be avoided wherever possible. (Also see Subdivision Ordinance for
regulations pertaining to the configuration of lots.)
32.2   Front yard.
      A.   On all corner lots, the front yard setback shall be observed along
the frontage of both intersecting streets, unless approved specifically
otherwise on a final plat. Where single-family and duplex lots have double
frontage, extending from one street to another, or are on a corner, a required
front yard shall be provided on both streets unless a side or rear yard
building line has been established along one frontage on the plat and the lot
is physically separated from the adjacent lot(s) by an alley, street right-of-
way, creek/flood plain area, or other similar phenomenon by a distance of 15
feet or more, in which event only one required front yard need be observed (see
§ 32.3). The side and/or rear yards in the case of single-family and duplex
uses shall be identified and the front of the structure shall not face the side
or rear yard (see Illustration 9 in
Appendix A-4).
      B.   Where the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting
streets is divided by two or more zoning districts, the front yard shall comply
with the requirements of the most restrictive district for the entire frontage
(see Illustration 3 in
Appendix A-4). Similarly, the front/side yards of a lot which has more than one
street frontage shall conform to the setback lines established by the
immediately adjacent lot(s) such that the setbacks along the block face are
uniform (i.e., consistent; not staggered). At least one front yard setback
shall be provided for every lot/parcel.
      C.   The front yard shall be measured from the property line to the front
face of the building, to the nearest supporting member of a covered porch or
terrace, or to any attached accessory building. Eaves and roof extensions or a
porch without posts or columns may project into the required front yard for a
distance not to exceed four feet, and subsurface structures, platforms or slabs
may not project into the front yard to a height greater than 30 inches above
the average grade of the yard (see Illustration 4 in 
Appendix A-4).
      D.   Minimum lot widths for lots with predominate frontage on the curved
radius of a street (e.g., cul-de-sac or "eyebrow" portion of a street) shall be
measured as the linear distance of the curved front building line, and shall be
shown on the subdivision plat. Lot widths for all lots shall be as set forth in
the respective zoning district for each lot.
      E.   Gasoline service station pump islands that parallel a public street
may be located a minimum of 18 feet to the property line adjacent to a public
street. For pump islands that are perpendicular or diagonal to a public street,
the setback shall be 30 feet in order to prevent vehicles stacking out into the
street while waiting for a pump position. Pump islands may extend beyond the
front building line as described above (provided that all other requirements of
this Ordinance are met), but shall not be closer than 15 feet to any property
line that is not adjacent to a public street.
      F.   Where a future right-of-way line has been established for future
widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, then
the front, side, or rear yard shall be measured from the future right-of-way
line.
      G.   The maximum height of fences and other structures within the front
yard shall be 36 inches.
32.3   Side yards.
      A.   On a corner lot used for one or two-family dwellings, both street
exposures shall be treated as front yards on all lots platted after December
21, 1997 (pursuant to the Subdivision Ordinance,
Chapter 155 of this code, as amended), except that one street exposure may be
designated as a side yard for the corner lot if an alley, street right-of-way,
creek/flood plain area, or other similar phenomenon physically separates the
corner lot from the adjacent lot by a distance of 15 feet or more. In such
case, a building line may be designated as a side yard of 15 feet or more (as
determined by the applicable zoning district standards). On lots which were
official lots of record prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, the
minimum side yard adjacent to a side street shall comply with the minimum
required side yard for the respective district.
      B.   Every part of a required side yard shall be open and unobstructed
except for the ordinary projections of window sills, belt courses, cornices,
and other architectural features not to exceed 12 inches into the required side
yard, and roof eaves projecting not to exceed 36 inches into the required side
yard. Air conditioning compressors and similar equipment are permitted in the
side yard.
      C.   Where a future right-of-way line has been established for future
widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare, upon which a lot abuts, then
the front, side, or rear yard shall be measured from the future right-of-way
line.
32.4   Special height regulations.
      A.   In the districts where the height of buildings is restricted to two
to three stories, cooling towers may extend for an additional height not to
exceed 50 feet above the average grade line of the building. Water stand pipes
and tanks, church steeples, domes and spires, school buildings, and
institutional buildings may be erected to exceed the height limit, as specified
in the particular zoning district, provided that one additional foot shall be
added to the width and depth of front, side, and rear yards for each foot that
such structures exceed the district height limit.
32.5   Communications antennas and support structures/towers.
      A.   In all residential zoning districts (AG, SF-15, SF-10, SF-6, R-1, R-
2 and MF), commercial antennas and antenna support structures are prohibited,
except as specified within this section.
         1.   A commercial antenna may be attached to a utility structure
(e.g., electrical transmission/distribution tower, elevated water storage tank,
and the like) exceeding 50 feet in height, provided that the antenna does not
extend more than ten feet above the height of the utility structure (see §
32.5.C. below).
         2.   A commercial antenna may be placed wholly within any building
permitted in the zoning district (see § 32.5.C. below). A commercial antenna
may be mounted flush to the exterior of a building/structure if it is painted
and/or disguised to integrate into the overall architectural design and is not
readily visible/identifiable as an antenna from public roadways or neighboring
residential properties.
      B.   In nonresidential zoning districts (C/B and I), commercial antennas
and antenna support structures are allowed as follows:
         1.   Commercial antenna support structures are allowed by right if
they do not exceed the maximum building height allowed for the zoning district
in which they are located. Structures in excess of the height allowed in the
zoning district may be allowed by Specific Use Provision (SUP). In all
nonresidential zoning districts, antenna support structures must meet the
setback requirements from residential districts.
         2.   A commercial antenna may be attached to a utility structure
(e.g., electrical transmission/ distribution tower, elevated water storage
tank, and the like) exceeding 50 feet in height, provided that the antenna does
not extend more than ten feet above the height of the utility structure (see §
32.5.C. below).
         3.   A commercial antenna may be placed wholly within any building
permitted in the zoning district (see § 32.5.C. below). A commercial antenna
may also be mounted flush to the exterior of a building/structure if it is
painted and/or disguised to integrate into the overall architectural design and
is not readily visible/identifiable as an antenna from public roadways or
neighboring residential properties.
      C.   No commercial antenna support structure shall be closer to any
residential district boundary line or residential dwelling than a distance
equal to twice the height of the support structure. Such setback/distance shall
be measured as the shortest possible distance in a straight line from the
structure to the closest point of a residential district boundary line or
residential dwelling. Setbacks from residentially zoned property do not apply
to antennae attached to utility structures exceeding 50 feet in height, or to
antennae placed wholly within or mounted upon a building.
      D.   No amateur or commercial antenna, antenna support structure,
microwave reflector/antenna, or associated foundations or support wires or
appurtenances shall be located within any required setback area for the front,
side or rear yards (see Illustration 8 in
Appendix A-4).
      E.   Antennae (amateur or commercial) shall not interfere with radio or
television reception of adjoining property owners, and shall comply with all
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In no manner shall
the use of such equipment infringe upon adjoining property owners.
      F.   Satellite dishes and other similar antennas shall be permitted on
the roof of a building, as long as satellite dishes do not exceed three feet in
diameter and antennas do not extend over 12 feet above the roof of the
building. Any parabolic or satellite dish antenna over three feet in diameter,
but not exceeding 12 feet in diameter, may be mounted on the roof if a letter
certifying the roof’s/building’s structural stability is written and sealed by
a registered architect or engineer and submitted to the City Manager, or his/
her designee. Roof-mounted antennae that comply with the above do not require
additional yard setbacks or setbacks from residential areas or dwellings.
      G.   Only one satellite dish shall be permitted per residential lot or
primary structure, except that a maximum of two dishes shall be allowed if both
units are three feet or less in diameter. Satellite dishes in any residential
district shall not exceed 12 feet in diameter, and must be permitted by the
City Manager or his/her designee.
      H.   All commercial signs, flags, lights and attachments other than those
required for communications operations, structural stability, or as required
for flight visibility by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and FCC
shall be prohibited on any antenna or antenna support structure.
      I.   All publicly owned antennae or antenna support structures shall be
permitted in any district (e.g., public safety communications, and the like).
32.6   Minimum dwelling unit area.
      Minimum dwelling unit areas specified in this Ordinance shall be computed
exclusive of breezeways, garages, open porches, carports and accessory
buildings.
32.7   Open storage areas.
      Open storage of materials, commodities or equipment (where allowed in the
specific zoning district) shall be located behind the front building line and
observe all setback requirements for the main structure or building. This
standard does not apply to outside display (see definition of outside display
in
Appendix A-1).
32.8   Sight visibility.
      Visual clearance shall be provided in all zoning districts so that no
fence, wall, architectural screen, earth mounding or landscaping 30 inches or
higher above the street center line obstructs the vision of a motor vehicle
driver approaching any street, alley, or driveway intersection as follows:
      A.   At a street intersection, clear vision must be maintained for a
minimum of 25 feet across any lot measured from the corner of the property line
in both directions (see Illustration 12 in
Appendix A-4).
      B.   At an intersection with an alley, this clearance must be maintained
for ten feet (see Illustration 12 in
Appendix A-4).
      C.   Shrubs and hedges that are typically less than 30 inches in height
at maturity, as measured from the centerline of the street, may be located in
the visual clearance areas of all districts.
      D.   A limited number of single-trunk trees having a clear trunk (i.e.,
branching) height of at least eight feet may be located within sight visibility
areas provided that they are spaced and positioned such that they will not
produce a visibility inhibiting, “picket-fence” effect when they attain mature
size.
32.9   Single-family detached, single-family attached, duplex, triplex and
quadriplex housing units.
      A.   In all zoning districts except the R-2 district, all single-family
detached, single-family attached, duplex, triplex and quadriplex housing units
shall have a minimum 6:12 roof pitch. Housing units with a roof pitch of less
than 6:12 shall have a minimum 12-inch roof overhang (e.g., 12-inch eaves/
soffits), but in no case shall have a roof pitch of less than 4:12.
Industrialized housing units shall have the tongue and axle(s) removed, and
shall be permanently anchored to a continuous, cast-in-place, reinforced
concrete foundation wall, in accordance with the city’s Building Code and other
safety codes.

34.1   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Ordinance, they
shall be held to the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
safety, health, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare. It is not
intended by this Ordinance to interfere with or abrogate or annul any

deemed to have been legalized unless specifically such use falls within a use
district where the actual use is a conforming use. Otherwise, such uses shall
remain nonconforming uses where recognized, or an illegal use, as the case may
be. It is further the intent and declared purpose of this Ordinance that no
offense committed, and no liability, penalty, or forfeiture, either civil or
criminal, incurred prior to the time the exiting Zoning Ordinance was repealed

circumstances create an emergency requiring the provisions of this Ordinance to
become effective immediately upon passage in order to promote the general
welfare of the city and its inhabitants. Accordingly, this Ordinance shall take
effect immediately from and after its passage, thereby suspending the need for
additional readings of this Ordinance.
