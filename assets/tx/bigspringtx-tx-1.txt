acts may be complained of by said charging party which did not happen or occur

sixty-five (365) days, and has exhausted all internal appeal procedures, the

written statement and charges against the employee and the disciplinary action

party.

formation of the charges if necessary to establish a proper defense.
   (2)   be represented by counsel or by a person of his choice; and
   (3)   present witnesses in his defense and cross-examine any adverse
witness.
   The hearing must be fair and impartial, and the Retired District Judge shall
determine if the facts justify the disciplinary action taken against the
employee. The Retired District Judge may consider only the evidence presented
at the hearing. Disciplinary action may not be taken against an employee
without good and reasonable cause.
   The Retired District Judge shall either uphold the disciplinary action,
dismiss it, or reduce it. The decision of the Retired District Judge is final

   (c)   Insurance. The operator shall procure and maintain insurance of the
types and in the minimum limits set forth in the schedule of minimum standards
for the respective categories of aeronautical services. The insurance company
writing the required policy shall be licensed to do business in the state.
Where more than one aeronautical service is proposed, the minimum limits will

agreement, during the performance of this agreement, lessee, for itself, its
heirs, personal representatives, successors in interest and assigns, as part of
the consideration for this agreement, does hereby covenant and agree, as a
covenant running with the land, that:

national origin shall be excluded from participation in, denied the benefit of,
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination in the use of the premises.
         b.   In the construction of any improvements on, over or under the
premises, and the furnishing of services therein or thereon, no person on the
grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin shall be excluded

requirements imposed by or pursuant to 49 CFR 21, sub-title A, Department of
Transportation, Office of the Secretary, Nondiscrimination in Federally
Assisted Programs of the Department of Transportation—Effectuation of Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1954, and as said regulations may be amended.
         d.   In the event of breach of any of the above nondiscrimination
covenants, the lessor shall have the right to terminate this agreement and to
reenter and repossess the premises and hold the same as if said agreement had
never been made or issued. This provision does not become effective until the
procedures of 49 CFR 21 have been followed and completed, including expiration
of appeal rights.
      (2)   Aircraft service by owner or operator of aircraft. No right granted
herein shall operate to prevent any person, firm or corporation operating
aircraft on the airport from performing any services on its own aircraft with
its own regular employees (including, but not limited to, maintenance and
repair) that it may choose to perform.
      (3)   Non-exclusive rights. It is not the intent of this agreement to
grant to the lessee the exclusive right to provide any or all of the services
described in this article at any time during the term of this agreement. The
lessor reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to grant others certain
rights and privileges upon the airport which are identical in part or in whole
to those granted to the lessee. However, the lessor does covenant and agree
that:
         a.   It shall enforce all minimum operating standards or requirements
for all aeronautical endeavors and activities conducted at the airport;
         b.   Any other operator of aeronautical endeavors or activities will
not be permitted to operate on the airport under rates, terms or conditions
which are more favorable than those set forth in this agreement; and
         c.   It will not permit the conduct of any aeronautical endeavor or
activity at the airport except under an approved lease and operating agreement.
      (4)   Airport development. The city reserves the right to further develop
or improve the landing area of the airport as it sees fit, regardless of the
views of the operator, and without interference or hindrance. If the physical
development of the airport requires the relocation of the operator, the city
agrees to provide a comparable location with similar facilities, and agrees to
relocate all operator-owned buildings or provide similar facilities for the
operator at no cost.
      (5)   City's rights. The city reserves the right (but shall not be
obligated to the operator) to maintain and keep in repair the landing area of
the airport and all publicly owned facilities of the same together with the
right to direct and control all activities of the operator in this regard.
      (6)   War or national emergency. During any time of war or national
emergency, the city shall have the right to lease the landing area or any part
thereof to the United States Government for military use and, if such lease is
executed, the provisions of this instrument insofar as they are inconsistent
with the provisions of the lease to the government, shall be suspended or
modified in whatever manner is appropriate to the situation.
      (7)   Airport obstructions. The city reserves the right to take any
action it considers necessary to protect the aerial approaches of the airport
against obstruction, together with the right to prevent the operator from
erecting, or permitting to be erected, any building or other structure on the
airport which, in the opinion of the city, would limit the usefulness of the
airport or constitute a hazard to aircraft.
      (8)   Subordination. This agreement shall be subject and subordinate to
the provisions of the indenture and the amendment to indenture whereby the
lessor derived title to the premises from the United States and to any existing
or future agreement between the lessor and the United States, or any agency
thereof, relative to the operation or maintenance of the airport, the execution
of which has been or may be required as a condition precedent to the
expenditure of federal funds for the development or operation of the airport;
provided, however, that the lessor shall, to the extent permitted by law, use
its best efforts to cause any such agreements to include provisions protecting
and preserving the rights of the lessee in and to the premises, and to
compensation for the taking thereof, interference therewith and damage thereto,
caused by such agreement or by actions of lessors of the United States pursuant
thereto.
      (9)   Compliance with laws, etc. The lessee shall comply with all
federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations which may apply to the
conduct of the business contemplated, including rules and regulations
promulgated by the lessor, and the lessee shall keep in effect and post in a
prominent place all necessary and/or required licenses or permits.
      (10)   Indemnity. To the extent not covered by insurance carried in favor
of the lessor, the lessee shall keep and hold harmless the lessor from and
against any and all claims, demands, suits, judgments, costs and expenses
asserted by any person, including agents or employees of lessor or lessee, by
reason of death or injury to persons or loss or damage to property, resulting
from the lessee's operations, or anything done or omitted by the lessee, under
this agreement except to the extent that such claims, demands, suits,
judgments, costs and expenses may be attributed to the acts or omissions of the
lessor or its agent or employees.
      (11)   Misrepresentation. This agreement constitutes the entire
understanding between the parties, and as of its effective date, supersedes all
prior or independent agreements between the parties covering the subject matter
hereof. Any change or modification hereof must be in writing signed by both
parties.
   (e)   Miscellaneous. The prospective operator may select one or a
combination of the aeronautical services covered by the city's minimum
standards and requirements. Where more than one activity is proposed, the
minimum requirements will vary (dependent upon the nature of individual
services in such combination) but will not necessarily be cumulative in all
instances. Because of these variables, the applicable minimum standards on
combinations of services will be discussed with the prospective operator at the
time of his application or, otherwise, during lease negotiations.
   The pertinent minimum standards and requirements for any commercial aviation
operator will be predicated upon the nature of his initial business venture.
If, at a later date, the business is expanded to encompass new and additional
types of services, the negotiated minimum standards established for these
additional services shall immediately apply.

retained for five years and be readily available for review by the POTW.
   (e)   Alternative treatment.
      (1)   A person commits an offense if the person introduces, or causes,
permits, or suffers the introduction of any surfactant, solvent or emulsifier
into a grease trap. Surfactants, solvents, and emulsifiers are materials which
allow the grease to pass from the trap into the collection system, and include,
but are not limited to, enzymes, soap, diesel, kerosene, terpene, and other
solvents.
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to an enforcement of subsection (e)(1)
of this section that the use of surfactants or soaps is incidental to normal
kitchen hygiene operations.
      (3)   Bioremediation media may be used with the POTW's approval if the
person has proved to the satisfaction of the POTW that laboratory testing which
is appropriate for the type of grease trap to be used has verified that:
         a.   The media is a pure live bacterial product which is not
inactivated by the use of domestic or commercial disinfectants and detergents,
strong alkalis, acids, and/or water temperatures of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71
degrees Celsius).
         b.   The use of the media does not reduce the buoyancy of the grease
layer in the grease trap and does not increase the potential for oil and grease
to be discharged to the sanitary sewer.
         c.   The use of the bioremediation does not cause foaming in the
sanitary sewer.
         d.   The BOD, COD and TSS discharge to the sanitary sewer after use of
the media does not exceed the BOD, COD and TSS which would be discharged if the
product were not being used and the grease trap was being properly maintained.
pH levels must be between five and 11.
      (4)   All testing designed to satisfy the criteria set in subsection (e)
(3) of this section shall be scientifically sound and statistically valid. All
tests to determine oil and grease, TSS, BOD, COD, pH, and other pollutant
levels shall use appropriate tests which have been approved by the
Environmental Protection Agency and the state commission on environmental
quality and which are defined in title 40 CFR 136 or 30 Tex. Admin. Code §
319.11. Testing shall be open to inspection by the POTW, and shall meet POTW's
approval.
   (f)   Schedule of penalties.
      (1)   If the POTW determines that a generator is responsible for a
blockage of a collection system line the generator shall owe a civil penalty of
$1,000.00 for the first violation, $1,500.00 for a second violation, and
$2,000.00 for the third violation within a two-year period. Continuous
violations shall result in an increase in penalty by $500.00 and may also
result in termination of services.
      (2)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be
subject to a written warning for the first violation, a $1,000.00 civil penalty
for the second violation, a $1,500.00 civil penalty for the third violation,
and a $2,000.00 civil penalty for the fourth violation within a two-year
period. Consistent violations will result in a $500.00 increase in civil
penalty and may result in termination of service.
   (g)   Appeals and hearings. Appeals and hearings concerning the regulations
of this section shall be through the Structural Standards Ordinance.

and the state water commission, together with a time schedule for compliance;
         d.   He shall be requested to contact the city within ten days so that

      (2)   A copy of the letter giving notice of the alleged violator,
described under subsection (1) of this section, shall be sent to the state
water commission, Austin, Texas. Investigation reports and names of witnesses
which are available at that time shall be attached to the letter. A carbon copy

(Prior Code, § 16-104; Ord. No. 96-83, 12-13-1986; Ord. of 9-22-1992)
Sec. 20-113. Preserving evidence of litigation purposes.
   (a)   Maps, diagrams and sketches.
      (1)   Accuracy. The paper must correctly represent the situation as it
existed at the time of consideration. It is not necessary that the map or
sketch be drawn to scale provided it is a fair representation.
      (2)   Verification. It is usually held that it is not necessary that the
person making the map, diagram or sketch testify as to its correctness, but any
person acquainted with the facts may do so.
   (b)   Photographs.
      (1)   Instructive. Whenever the appearance of a person, place or object
is relevant, a photograph or picture is admissible to explain the evidence and
aid in its application and to assist the court or jury in understanding the
case.
      (2)   Accuracy. The photograph must be a fair and accurate reproduction
of the things or conditions as they were when the photograph was taken. Where a
photograph is offered, not as a mere general representation of the thing or
condition, but to show distances, colors, relative sizes, or locations of
objects, it may be very deceptive and misleading, therefor, much more
convincing proof of its accuracy is required.
      (3)   Verification. It is best if the photograph is verified by oath of
photographer who took it; however, sufficient verification may be furnished by
the testimony of any competent witness who has sufficient knowledge to testify
that the photograph fairly represents what it purports to represent. The
presence of a verifying witness when the photograph was taken may be a factor
in determining the sufficiency of the accuracy.
      (4)   Notice to adverse party. It is not essential to the admissibility
of the photographs that the adverse party should have been notified of the
intention to take them.
      (5)   Inscription on picture. When an otherwise admissible picture has an
inscription on it or on the reverse side of it, before the photograph can be
admitted, the handwriting must be identified or concealed so that only the
picture itself, and not the message inscribed on it, can be considered as
evidence.
   (c)   Samples; identification. Samples are admissible on an issue as to the
properties or qualities of the substance involved in the case where they are
sufficiently identified as to their source and that they reflect the condition
of the substance or articles as of the time involved in the issues.
   (d)   Documents; existence and genuineness. The document must be produced in
court, together with witnesses to identify it.
(Prior Code, § 16-105; Ord. No. 96-83, 12-13-1983; Ord. of 9-22-1992)
Sec. 20-114. Pollution investigations.
   In the event of pollution incidents, including unpermitted discharges,
spills of oil or other hazardous materials, where legal action against the
discharger or person responsible for a spill may result, the investigator shall
obtain the following:
      (1)   Names, addresses, telephone numbers and positions of all persons
who may be responsible for or have knowledge of the discharge or spill.
      (2)   Signed statements, wherever possible, indicating where, when and
how the discharge or spill occurred and the extent of the discharge or spill.
(In cases where a witness will not sign a statement, his oral statement should
be immediately reduced to writing and should be submitted with the
investigator's written report).
      (3)   Samples of discharge or spilled materials, as well as comparative
samples from affected and unaffected water in proximity to the discharge or
spill. Sample containers are to be immediately and indelibly labeled with the
appropriate sample number by the collector and a chain of custody record
attached. (See section
20-115).
      (4)   Photographs at the scene to illustrate the source and extent of
pollution. Polaroid photographs of good quality are preferable as evidence and
should be immediately labeled with the location, date, time, a short
description of what is being illustrated, and signed by the photographer. If
possible, the signature of a witness at the scene should also be obtained for
corroborative purposes.
      (5)   License number and other registration of vehicles or vessels
involved in pollution incidents. Drivers or operators should be identified, and
a record made of their names, addresses, employers and identification.
      (6)   Field notes made at the scene. (Since these can be used on the
witness stand, the investigator should complete them at the scene and, if
possible, have a witness at the scene initial or sign them. Field notes should
also contain a sketch of the site with appropriate labeling).
(Prior Code, § 16-106; Ord. No. 96-83, 12-31-1983; Ord. of 9-22-1992)
Sec. 20-115. Chain of custody.
   All samples and other tangible evidence should be maintained in proper
custody until disposition or until the samples are dispatched to a laboratory
for analysis. A record of sample number, source of sample, time, date, and name
of person taking the sample and each person handling the sample will be kept
with the sample on a chain of custody record until the sample is delivered to
the laboratory. (Placing a sample addressed to the laboratory in the U.S. mail
constitutes delivery to the laboratory.) Upon delivery to the laboratory, the
chain of custody record should be immediately submitted to the city s water
pollution control office, attached to a signed and dated memorandum of
transmittal.
(Prior Code, § 16-107; Ord. No. 96-83, 12-13-1983; Ord. of 9-22-1992)
Sec. 20-116. Reports.
   All reports of investigation of water pollution incidents should be
completed promptly. The report should provide appropriate descriptions, sample
data, maps, photographs, etc., to accurately and fully depict:
      (1)   The waste generating activities or the incident in which a spill
occurred;
      (2)   The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the waste
generated or the material spilled;
      (3)   The route of the waste or spilled material to the receiving waters;
      (4)   The receiving waters;
      (5)   The effects of the waste or spilled material on the receiving
waters;
      (6)   The location of the waste generating activity (include street
address, if any) or the location of the spill;
      (7)   The names and addresses of witnesses and complainants willing to
provide information;
      (8)   A current list of responsible officials;
      (9)   A list of other agencies concerned in the investigation, such as
cities, counties, river authorities, etc.;
      (10)   All other pertinent information.

Sec. 22-1. Collections.
   To the extent allowed by law, the city will assess a collection fee of 30
percent of the total amount of the account balance for receivable accounts that

determination is made by the city council.

(Ord. No. 004-2020, 1-28-2020; Ord. No. 043-2020, § 2, 11-17-2020)
Sec. 28-190. Unlawful acts.
   (1)   Abortion. It shall be unlawful for any person to procure or perform an
abortion of any type and at any stage of pregnancy in the City of Big Spring,
Texas.
   (2)   Aiding or abetting an abortion. It shall be unlawful for any person to
knowingly aid or abet an abortion that occurs in the City of Big Spring, Texas.
This section does not prohibit referring a patient to have an abortion which
takes place outside of the city limits of Big Spring, TX. This includes, but is
not limited to, the following acts:

   (1)   Neither the City of Big Spring, nor any of its officers or employees,
nor any district or county attorney, nor any executive or administrative
officer or employee of any state or local governmental entity, shall take any
steps to enforce this article against a person or entity that commits an
unlawful act described in section 28-190, unless and until the Supreme Court
overrules Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood v. Casey,
505 U.S. 833 (1992), and permits states and municipalities to once again

commits an unlawful act described in section 28-190 shall be subject to the
maximum penalty permitted under Texas law for the violation of a municipal
ordinance governing public health, and each violation shall constitute a
separate offense.
(Ord. No. 004-2020, 1-28-2020)
Sec. 28-192. Private enforcement.
   (1)   A person or entity that commits an unlawful act described in section

(Ord. No. 004-2020, 1-28-2020)
Sec. 28-193. Severability,
   (1)   Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the
context of determining the severability of a state statute regulating abortion
the United States Supreme Court held that an explicit statement of legislative
intent is controlling, it is the intent of the city council that every
provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this
article, and every application of the provisions in this article, are severable
from each other. If any application of any provision in this article to any
person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid or
unconstitutional, then the remaining applications of that provision to all
other persons and circumstances shall be severed and may not be affected. All
constitutionally valid applications of this article shall be severed from any
applications that a court finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications
in force, because it is the city council's intent and priority that the valid
applications be allowed to stand alone. Even if a reviewing court finds a
provision of this article to impose an undue burden in a large or substantial
fraction of relevant cases, the applications that do not present an undue
burden shall be severed from the remaining provisions and shall remain in
force, and shall be treated as if the city council had enacted an ordinance
limited to the persons, group of persons, or circumstances for which the
statute's application does not present an undue burden. The city council
further declares that it would have passed this article, and each provision,
section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, and all constitutional
applications of this article, irrespective of the fact that any provision,
section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or applications of this
article, were to be declared unconstitutional or to represent an undue burden.
   (2)   If any provision of this article is found by any court to be
unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not
present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in force,
consistent with the declarations of the city council's intent in section
28-193(1).
   (3)   No court may decline to enforce the severability requirements in
sections
28-193(1) and (2) on the ground that severance would "rewrite" the ordinance or
involve the court in legislative activity. A court that declines to enforce or
enjoins a city official from enforcing a subset of an ordinance's applications
is never "rewriting" an ordinance, as the ordinance continues to say exactly
what it said before. A judicial injunction or declaration of
unconstitutionality is nothing more than a non-enforcement edict that can
always be vacated by later courts if they have a different understanding of
what the Constitution requires; it is not a formal amendment of the language in
a statute or ordinance. A judicial injunction or declaration of
unconstitutionality no more "rewrites" an ordinance than a decision by the
executive not to enforce a duly enacted ordinance in a limited and defined set
of circumstances.
   (4)   If any federal or state court ignores or declines to enforce the
requirements of sections
28-193(1) and (2), or (3), or holds a provision of this article invalid on its
face after failing to enforce the severability requirements of sections
28-193(1) and (2), for any reason whatsoever, then the mayor shall hold
delegated authority to issue a saving construction of the ordinance that avoids
the constitutional problems or other problems identified by the federal or
state court, while enforcing the provisions of the ordinance to the maximum
possible extent. The saving construction issued by the mayor shall carry the
same force of law as an ordinance; it shall represent the authoritative
construction of the ordinance in both federal and state judicial proceedings;
and it shall remain in effect until the court ruling that declares invalid or
enjoins the enforcement of the original provision in the ordinance is
overruled, vacated, or reversed.
   (5)   The Mayor must issue the saving construction described in section
28-193(4) within 20 days after a judicial ruling that declares invalid or
enjoins the enforcement of a provision of this article after failing to enforce
the severability requirements of
28-193(1) and (2). If the mayor fails to issue the saving construction required
by
28-193(4) within 20 days after a judicial ruling that declares invalid or
enjoins the enforcement of a provision of this article after failing to enforce
the severability requirements of sections
28-193(1) or (2), or if the mayor's saving construction fails to enforce the
provisions of the ordinance to the maximum possible extent permitted by the
Constitution or other superseding legal requirements, as construed by the
federal or state judiciaries, then any person may petition for a writ of
mandamus requiring the mayor to issue the saving construction described in
section
28-193(4).
(Ord. No. 004-2020, 1-28-2020)
Sec. 28-194. Effective date.
   This article shall go into immediate effect upon majority vote within the

corporation shall be notified by the sanitation department of the container
location assigned to that person, firm or corporation. The use of other
containers is not permitted. The sanitation department shall place the
appropriate sized containers throughout the city in such a manner to adequately
serve all residential and commercial accounts. If the volume of garbage from
any one commercial account is sufficient to justify a separate container for
that establishment, the sanitation department shall so place a container at
that location. Notwithstanding conflicting provisions herein and subject to the
approval of the public works director or his designee, commercial account
holders may place garbage containers at designated locations.
   (b)   The city shall provide individual roll-out trash containers to
residential account holders where it is impractical to service the collection

destroyed, the account holder will be required to pay the full cost of a
replacement container.
   (c)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to block
access to solid waste containers in a manner that hinders the collection of
solid waste. In the event a solid waste container is located in a street within
ten feet of the driveway of the residence to which it is assigned, there is a
rebuttable presumption that the container was placed by the authority of the
public works director or his designee.

view. Each sheet of the plans must have a note instructing the contractor to
verify the location of underground utilities at least 100 feet in advance of
all proposed utility crossings, and also at locations where the proposed
facilities are shown to be running parallel to existing facilities within five
feet. The plans must be half-size (11 inches by 17 inches) at a scale no
smaller than one inch equals 40 feet in plan view and one inch equals six feet
in profile view. Each project must be assigned a project number, which must
appear on each sheet.
      (6)   A permit is required even if other authority has been granted by
the director to make a pavement cut or excavation in a public right-of-way as
part of a city construction project.
      (7)   The director shall state on the permit the activity for which the
permit is issued and include any additional restrictions or requirements
determined necessary by the director.
      (8)   The permittee has the exclusive responsibility to coordinate with
other public service providers to protect all existing facilities in the public
right-of-way in which the construction occurs.
      (9)   The permittee shall, as an express condition of the permit, comply
in all respects with the requirements prescribed for the permitted activity in
the Pavement Cut and Repair Standards Manual and with all other city ordinances
and state or federal laws or regulations affecting the permitted activity.
      (10)   The director shall notify public service providers that registered
during the previous calendar year of pavement surfaces to be reconstructed or
resurfaced by the city during the next calendar year.
      (11)   A public service provider planning construction within the public
right-of-way shall notify the director by March 1 of each year of all then-
known facility expansion or replacement projects planned for the next fiscal
year that may require pavement cuts or excavations.
      (12)   The director may require any permittee to use trenchless
technology or boring, instead of disturbing a public right-of-way surface, if
it is:
         a.   In the best interest of the city;
         b.   Technically, commercially, and economically feasible; and
         c.   Not in violation of federal or state regulations or industry
safety standards.
      (13)   Directional drilling or boring may not be used in the central
business district, unless otherwise approved by the director as being in the
best interest of the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience.
      (14)   In using trenchless technology or boring, whether or not required
under this subsection, the permittee must:
         a.   Obtain and have at the construction site recent plans from the
city's water utilities department, and, where available, plans from owners of
all other underground facilities, showing the horizontal and vertical placement
of the underground facilities, if the permittee's proposed facilities will:
            1.   Cross other existing facilities; or
            2.   Be located within five feet of existing facilities at any
point.
         b.   Locate all water main lines by potholing, if the permittee's
proposed facilities will:
            1.   Cross other existing facilities; or
            2.   Be located within five feet of existing facilities at any
point; and
            3.   Be able to locate the bore head at all times in accordance
with the latest technologies and provide the location of the bore to the
director upon request.
      (15)   The permittee shall maintain the construction area in a public
right-of-way in a manner that avoids dust, other health hazards, and hazards to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic until the public right-of-way is permanently
repaired.
      (16)   When making a pavement cut or excavation, or placing spoils or
excavated material in or along a public right-of-way, the permittee shall place
barricades, warning signs, and warning lights at the location sufficient to
warn the public of the hazard of the cut, excavation, spoils, or excavated
material in compliance with the 1980 edition of the Texas Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, as amended, published by the state department of
transportation.
      (17)   The director may require the permittee to share trench space to
minimize the disruption of vehicular and pedestrian traffic or to provide space
for needed city facility installations if such sharing is:
         a.   Technically, commercially, and economically feasible; and
         b.   Not in violation of state or federal regulations or industry
safety standards.
   (d)   The following additional procedures apply if it is necessary to close,
in whole or in part, a public right-of-way for purposes of making a pavement
cut or an excavation:
      (1)   For any closure of a traffic lane or blocking of a sidewalk or
alley lasting one day or less, the permittee shall conspicuously mark its
vehicles with the permittee's name and telephone number.
      (2)   Any closure of a traffic lane or blocking of a sidewalk or alley
lasting longer than one day must be identified by a sign that is clearly
legible to the traveling public. The sign must be posted at or in close
proximity to the worksite and must contain:
         a.   The name of the permittee;
         b.   The name of the person performing the construction on behalf of
the permittee, if any; and
         c.   A local 24-hour contact number that can be used in case of
emergency or to answer any questions.
      (3)   The requirements of this subsection are in addition to any other
signage, barricades, or warning devices required by law or ordinance. The sign
information required by subsection (d)(2) of this section may be included on
barricades or warning devices.
      (4)   When permitted construction will last longer than two weeks, the
permittee shall give written notification to all adjacent property occupants by
conspicuously posting the notification on each adjacent property at least 72
hours before commencement of construction, unless the director determines that
an emergency exists.
      (5)   If a street or alley must be totally closed for any duration, the
permittee shall provide for reasonable alternative access to the adjacent
property by the property's occupants and invitees, which access must include,
but is not limited to, deliveries to the property.
      (6)   If construction on a partially closed thoroughfare stops for the
day, all thoroughfare lanes must be reopened to traffic, unless an extended
time of closure is expressly granted by the permit.
      (7)   If a pavement cut is to be covered, the permittee shall use steel
plates, or equivalent plates, of sufficient strength and thickness to support
all traffic.
      (8)   Plates must be sufficiently secured in place so as not to become
dislodged or in any way cause a hazard to any traffic. Asphalt transitions must
be placed as required to provide a reasonably smooth riding surface.
      (9)   Plates must be marked with the name of the person performing the
construction and with a local 24-hour contact number that can be used in case
of an emergency, unless a sign complying with subsection (d)(2) of this section
is posted at or in close proximity to the worksite.
      (10)   Unless it becomes necessary to conduct emergency activity, a
permittee shall not cause or allow interference with traffic flow on a
thoroughfare during the hours of 6:30 a.m. through 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
through 6:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
      (11)   A temporary repair may not remain on public right-of-way for more
than 14 calendar days after the completion of the repair or installation of the
underground structure or facility, unless a time extension has been granted by
the director. The city may, at the expense of the permittee or other
responsible person, remove any temporary repair remaining in the public right-
of-way beyond the 14-day time limit and make permanent repairs. Any exception
to the 14-day time limit, other than a relocation of a facility in advance of a
city construction project in the public right-of-way, must be approved by the
director prior to expiration of the time limit.
      (12)   If no construction has commenced under a permit within 120
calendar days after issuance of the permit, the permit becomes null and void,
and a new permit is required before construction may be performed in the public
right-of-way. An extension to a permit may be granted by the director only
before the permit expires.
      (13)   The director may refuse to issue a permit if:
         a.   The proposed construction will substantially interfere with
vehicles or pedestrians and no procedures, or procedures inconsistent with this
article, have been implemented to minimize the interference;
         b.   The proposed construction will substantially interfere with
another activity for which a permit has been issued, or will conflict or
interfere with existing facilities already in the public right-of-way;
         c.   The proposed barricading, channelizing, signing, warning, or
other traffic control procedures or equipment do not comply with the
requirements of the 1980 edition of the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, as amended;
         d.   The proposed construction, incidental traffic control, or other
permitted activity, or the manner in which it is to be performed, will violate
a city ordinance or regulation or a state or federal statute or regulation;
         e.   The permittee:
            1.   Failed to furnish all the information required by this
article;
            2.   Knowingly or intentionally furnished materially false or
incorrect information to the director;
            3.   Failed, except for good cause shown, to file the application
on the approved form within the time limits prescribed by this section;
            4.   Failed or refused to submit plans of record;
            5.   Was convicted of violating a provision of this article twice
within the two-year period immediately preceding the date of application;
            6.   Failed to furnish or have on file with the director the
insurance required under this article;
            7.   Is not in compliance with applicable requirements of an
existing permit issued under this article; or
            8.   Has not obtained a current copy of the Pavement Cut and Repair
Standards Manual from the director.
      (14)   The director may suspend construction or revoke an issued permit
on the same grounds on which a permit may be denied, or if the permittee:
         a.   Commences or performs construction in violation of an applicable
requirement of this article or the permit;
         b.   Creates or is likely to create a public health or safety hazard
by performance of the construction in question;
         c.   Fails to comply with an order or regulation of the director;
         d.   Fails to comply with restrictions or requirements of other city
ordinances or state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the
construction; or
         e.   Commences or performs work without having prior knowledge and
understanding of the applicable repair standards or without having obtained a
current copy of the Pavement Cut and Repair Standards Manual from the director.
      (15)   The director shall provide written notice of a suspension or
revocation to the permittee or the person hired by the permittee to perform the
construction.
      (16)   Construction that is suspended may not resume until the director
determines that the permittee has corrected the violation, noncompliance, or
hazard that caused the suspension. A permit that has been revoked may be
reinstated by the director if the director determines that:
         a.   The permittee has corrected the violation, noncompliance, or
hazard that caused the revocation; and
         b.   The health or safety of the public is not jeopardized by
reinstating the permit.
      (17)   Any variance from the requirements of this article must be
approved in advance by the director. The director may grant a variance only if
an extreme hardship exists and the public health, safety, welfare, and
convenience is not adversely affected by granting the variance. The director
may not approve any variance that would give a competitive advantage to one
public service provider over another public service provider providing the same
or similar service. The director may not grant a variance from the indemnity
requirements of this article.

filed proof of insurance under the requirements of this article is not required
to furnish separate proof of insurance under this section when obtaining a
permit, but must comply with all other requirements of this section.
   (b)   If the permittee is an entity that has a tangible net worth ratio of
three to one (assets to liabilities) with a minimum tangible net worth of at
least $100,000,000.00, proof of self-insurance sufficient to meet the coverage
required in subsection (a) of this section is sufficient to satisfy the

arise out of or be occasioned by any negligent, grossly negligent, wrongful, or
strictly liable act or omission of the permittee or its agents, employees, or
contractors, in the performance of work or activity pursuant to the permit
issued under this article, regardless of whether or not the negligence, gross
negligence, wrongful act, or fault of the city or its officers, agents, or
employees, contributes in any way to the damage, injury, or other harm. The
requirement of the permittee to defend the city also unconditionally applies
regardless of whether or not the negligence, gross negligence, or fault of the
city or its officers, agents, or employees contributes in any way to the
damage, injury, or other harm. Nothing in this subsection may be construed as
waiving any governmental immunity available to the city under state law. This
provision is solely for the benefit of the permittee and the city and is not
intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, in or to any
other person.
      (3)   This section does not apply to:

summarily denied. Except when a petition is summarily denied, the planning and
zoning commission shall conduct a public hearing to receive public comment on
the proposed change, which hearing shall be held not more than 30 days from the

of the majority of the city council is required for approval of the
application. If a majority of the city council does not vote in favor of the
change, it fails. A failed street name change cannot be reconsidered by the
city council unless a new petition is filed under subsection (b).
   (e)   Implementation of approved change. In the event that the city council
approves the change to the street name, the public works department shall
revise the official street name map, and notify affected property owners, all

change are not eligible for additional or further street name changes for a
period of no less than 20 years.

arterial (thoroughfares) and major collector streets are not eligible for
street name changes unless such street name change meets the unanimous consent
of the city planning and zoning commission and the city council.

honor of a business are not eligible, with the exception of a business that
meets all of the following criteria:

(four-plex or larger), mobile home park, and apartment complex, there shall be
a base rate for every unit, dwelling unit, or space that is connected to the
wastewater system. The base rate is as follows:
 
Residential unit     $11.88
Non-residential unit $19.44
 
Note: The first months' base rate for wastewater service for new customer
accounts shall be prorated based on the number of days left in the billing
cycle.
      (2)   A multifamily dwelling (four-plex or larger), a mobile home park
with more than ten spaces, or an existing apartment on a single meter shall be
given a five percent vacancy allowance against the total number of dwelling
units, spaces, or units in computing the total number of dwelling units, spaces
or units for which a base rate charge is due on each dwelling unit, space or
unit.
      (3)   In addition to the monthly base rate, each wastewater account shall
be charged for wastewater discharge based on water usage. The charge for non-
commercial accounts will be assessed at a rate of $ 1.62 per 1,000 gallons of
water usage. The charge for commercial accounts will be assessed at a rate of $
2.16 per 1,000 gallons of water usage. In making the assessment for
residential, water usage shall be computed by taking 90 percent of the
customer's average monthly water usage, as shown by city water records, for the
months of December, January, and February immediately preceding the year in
question. For commercial accounts, 90 percent of actual monthly water usage
will be used in calculating the charge for wastewater discharge. In lieu of the
foregoing water usage computation, a residential account will have the option
of applying to the city water office for computation of water usage based on
either of the following formulas:
         a.   One hundred gallons of water per day per person in the
residential customer's household times the number of days in the billing
period; or
         b.   Ninety percent of the actual water used by the customer during
the current month as shown by the city's water records. Any option elected will
be effective for a minimum of 12 months or until a history of consumption is
established, whichever comes first.
      (4)   Wastewater rates; no history of consumption. Where there is no
history of consumption to establish the average monthly water usage for
residential accounts during the months of December, January, and February as
stated in section (a)(3) of this section, an account will be billed for
wastewater discharged at the monthly base rate fee plus charges based on
current water usage. The water usage charge will be assessed at the rate of
$1.50 per 1,000 gallons of water. When making this assessment, water usage
shall be computed by taking 90 percent of the water used by the customer in the
current month as shown by city water records. In lieu of the foregoing water
usage computation, a residential account will have the option of applying to
the city water office for computation of water usage based on either of the
following formulas:
         a.   100 gallons of water per day per person in the residential
customer's household times the number of days in the billing period; or
         b.   90 percent of the actual water used by the customer during the
current month as shown by the city's water records. Any option elected will be
effective for a minimum of 12 months or until a history of consumption is
established, whichever comes first.
      (5)   The city manager or his representative shall have the authority to
grant a vacancy allowance greater than that authorized by section 50-52(a)(2)
upon presentation of records and documents by owners or operators which verify
claims of a higher vacancy rate. The vacancy rate granted by the city manager
or his representative shall not exceed the vacancy rate which is verified by
said records and documents. The city manager or his representative shall have
the right to review said vacancy allowance at any time and revise same but
shall not review said vacancy allowance at any time and revise same but shall
not review said vacancy allowance more than once per year at the request of the
owners or operators.
   (b)   Surcharge. In addition to the rates prescribed in subsection (a) of
this section, there shall be a surcharge of $2.00 per month per unit, space, or
dwelling unit served by each meter. Of the above described surcharge, $1.35
shall be dedicated exclusively to capital equipment and use as authorized by
the city council. To that end, the city treasurer shall deposit $1.35 of every
$2.00 surcharge collected in the surcharge fund established by the city. The
remaining $0.65 shall be deposited in the operations fund of the utility fund
of the city.

than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The
superintendent shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
(Prior Code, § 16-125; Ord. of 6-28-1933)
Sec. 50-125. Modifications of federal categorical pretreatment standards.
   Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by Federal Pretreatment Standards, the city may apply to the
approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the Federal
Pretreatment Standards. The term "consistent removal" means reduction in the
amount of pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent
which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when
measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2)), General
Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Source of Pollution, promulgated
pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the
Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7
are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.

Sec. 50-129. Accidental discharge.
   (a)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner or users own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before
construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by
January 1, 1984. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the
effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the
responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the
incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
   (b)   Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge the
user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
   (c)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.

expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (b)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (c)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.

discharged shall allow the city or its representative's ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The
city, approval authority and (where the NPDES state is the approval authority)
EPA, shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that
upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city's
approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.

wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review
and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of
the changes.
   (b)   The city shall annually publish in the Big Spring newspaper a list of
the users which were not in compliance with the pretreatment requirements or
standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall

applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to

wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the
opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or
causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
   (b)   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed
necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city
shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge.

this DCP, or in an amount in excess of that permitted by the drought response
stage in effect at the time pursuant to action taken by the city in accordance
with provisions of this DCP.
      (2)   Any person, including a person classified as a water customer of
the city, in apparent control of the property where a violation occurs or
originates, shall be presumed to be the violator, and proof that the violation
occurred on the person's property shall constitute a rebuttable presumption
that the person in apparent control of the property committed the violation,
but any such person shall have the right to show that he did not commit the
violation. Parents shall be presumed to be responsible for violations of their
minor children, and proof that a violation committed by a child occurred on
property within the parent's control shall constitute a rebuttable presumption
that the parent committed the violation, but any such parent may be excused if
he proves that he had previously directed the child not to use the water as it
was used in violation of this DCP and that the parent could not have reasonably
known of the violation.
      (3)   Any person who violates this DCP is guilty of a misdemeanor. If a
person is convicted of three or more distinct violations of this DCP, the
administrator shall, upon due notice to the customer, be authorized to
discontinue water service to the premises where such violations occurred.
Services discontinued under such circumstances shall be restored only upon
payment of a reconnection charge, established by city policy and any other
costs incurred by the city in discontinuing service and all assessed fines. In

a person over 14 years of age who is a member of the violator's immediate
family or is a resident of the violator's residence. The alleged violator shall
appear in municipal court to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty for the
violation of this DCP. If the alleged violator fails to appear in municipal
court, a warrant for his arrest may be issued. A summons to appear may be
issued in lieu of an arrest warrant. These cases shall be expedited and given
preferential setting in municipal court before all other cases.

permit, or to allow any other person under his control or authority to permit,
water to run or accumulate in any gutter or street within the city. It shall be

water is the result of an emergency such as extinguishing a fire or the result
of a water leak that has been reported to the city within a reasonable time.
   (c)   Wholesale customers. During any period when pro rata allocation of
available water supplies is in effect, the city shall discontinue water

         a.   Compliance with this DCP cannot be technically accomplished
during the duration of the water supply shortage or other condition for which

ARTICLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 1-1. Purpose.
   This chapter is adopted for the purpose of promoting the public health,
safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Big Spring. It is
adopted in accordance with and is intended to complement the city's
comprehensive plan, as adopted in 2016 (Resolution 09-2016). More specifically,
this chapter is intended to fulfill one or more of the following purposes:
   (a)   Preserve and enhance the integrity, stability and livability of
residential neighborhoods;
   (b)   Maintain property values by stabilizing expectations and ensuring
predictability in development;
   (c)   Prevent or minimize land use incompatibilities and conflict;
   (d)   Prevent overcrowding of buildings and overdevelopment of sites and
excessive concentrations of population or commercial activities;
   (e)   Encourage commercial revitalization;
   (f)   Preserve and enhance the city's natural environment and avoid natural
hazards in the development of the city;
   (g)   Balance the protection of community and neighborhood resources with
the need to promote economic development and protect individual property
rights;
   (h)   Maintain opportunities for development and redevelopment to respond to
changes in the marketplace, while respecting the character of surrounding
areas; and
   (i)   Establish a process that effectively and fairly applies the
regulations and standards of this chapter and respects the rights of property
owners and the interests of citizens.
SECTION 1-2. Short Title.
   The provisions of this chapter may be referred to or cited as the "zoning
regulations," or as "these regulations," or as "this Ordinance," or as "this
chapter."
SECTION 1-3. Severability.
   In the event that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of
this ordinance shall be declared or judged invalid or unconstitutional, such
adjudication shall in no means affect any other section, subsection, sentence,
clause or phrase of this ordinance, but the remainder hereof shall be in full
force and effect just as though the section, subsection, sentence, clause or
phrase as declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional was not originally a
part hereof.
SECTION 1-4. Conflict with other Laws.
   All ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent or in conflict with the
provisions of this ordinance shall be void and the same are hereby repealed,
except that nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as repealing any
existing ordinance regulating nuisances or as permitting or requiring uses that
are now prohibited by law, and ordinances imposing a greater restriction than
is imposed herein shall govern.
   No building, structure or use which was not lawfully existing at the time of
adoption of this ordinance shall become or be made legal solely by adoption of
this ordinance. By the passage of this ordinance, no presently illegal use
shall be deemed to have been legalized unless such use specifically falls
within a use district where the actual use is a conforming use. Otherwise, such
uses shall remain nonconforming uses where recognized, or an illegal use, as
the case may be. It is further the intent and declared purpose of this
ordinance that no offense committed, and no liability, penalty or forfeiture,
either civil or criminal, shall be discharged or affected by the adoption of
this ordinance; but prosecutions and suits for such offences, liabilities,
penalties or forfeitures may be instituted or causes pending be proceeded with
in all respects as if such prior ordinances had not been repealed.
SECTION 1-5. Relationship to the Comprehensive Plan.
   The regulations contained herein have been modified in accordance with a
comprehensive land use planning program for the orderly growth and development
of the City of Big Spring. The major modifications are herein undertaken to
streamline the existing ordinance by eliminating or updating obsolete or
ineffective portions of the previous zoning ordinance. Necessary changes have
been identified by:
   Citizens during the Comprehensive Plan effort.
   Planning and Zoning Commission members.
   Staff members of the City of Big Spring.
SECTION 1-6. Application and Exceptions.
   These zoning regulations apply to all land located within the City's
corporate limits, except as follows:
   (a)   These regulations do not apply to a building, structure, or land owned
or leased by the City, the State of Texas, or the United States, or an agency
thereof.
   (b)   Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, this chapter
does not apply to the erection, construction, alteration, or maintenance of
cables, conduits, lines, wires or vaults, or similar equipment lawfully
installed and maintained by a public utility. This exemption does not apply to
buildings, structures, or communication towers constructed by, owned, leased or
controlled by a public utility.
SECTION 1-7. Effective Date.
   The effective date of this Chapter and revision of the zoning ordinances of
the City of Big Spring shall be effective on June 12, 2001.
SECTION 1-8. Violations and Penalties.
   It is unlawful for any person to violate, or cause to allow any other person
under his or her control or authority to violate, any provision or requirement
of these zoning regulations. The violation of any of these zoning regulations
is unlawful and may be punished by a fine not to exceed $2,000[.00] for each
offense. Each day a violation occurs is a separate offense.
SECTION 1-9. Interpretation.
   If any provision of these zoning regulations imposes a higher standard than
that required by any other City regulation not contained in these zoning
regulations, the provisions of these zoning regulations control. If any
provision of any City regulation not contained in these zoning regulations
imposes a higher standard, that regulation controls.
SECTIONS 1-10—1-15. Reserved.

interpreted as those of a similar listed use.
   (b)   Where a determination of the minimum parking requirements cannot be
readily ascertained for new or unlisted uses according to (a) above or where
uncertainty exists, the minimum off-street parking requirements shall be
established by the same process as provided in Section

SECTION 4-14. Special Area and Use Regulations.
   (a)   Courts. Where an apartment building or buildings are erected so as to
create enclosed inner courts, the faces of all opposite walls in such courts
shall be a minimum distance of thirty (30) feet apart and no balcony or canopy
shall extend into such court area for a distance greater than five (5) feet.
   (b)   Location of Dwellings and Buildings. Only one main building for one-
family, two-family or multiple-family use with permitted accessory buildings
may be located upon a lot or platted tract. Every dwelling shall face or front
upon a public street, other than an alley, which means of access shall have a
minimum width of thirty (30) feet. Where a lot is used for retail, commercial,
industrial purposes, or a combination of same, or for a combination of retail
and dwelling purposes, more than one (1) main building may be located upon the
lot, but only when such buildings conform to all the open space, parking and
density requirements applicable to the uses and districts and when all such
main buildings face upon a public street, other than an alley. Whenever two (2)
or more main buildings, or portions thereof, are desired to be placed upon a
single lot or tract and such buildings will not face upon a public street, the
same may be permitted when the site plan for such development is approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission so as to comply with the normal requirements
for platting. No parking area, storage area, or required open space for one (1)
building shall be computed as being the open space, yard or area requirements
for any other dwelling or other use.
   (c)   Temporary Construction Buildings. Temporary buildings and temporary
building material storage areas to be used for construction purposes may be
permitted for a special period of time in accordance with a permit issued by
the Building Official and subject to periodic renewal by the Building Official
for cause shown. Upon completion or abandonment of construction or expiration
of permit, such field offices and buildings shall be removed at the direction
of the Building Official.
SECTION 4-15. Creation of Building Site.
   No permit for the construction of a building or buildings upon any tract
shall be issued until a building site, building tract or building lot has been
created by compliance with one of the following conditions:
   (a)   The lot or tract is part of a plat of record, properly approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and filed in the Plat Records of Howard County.
In order to avoid conflict with side setback requirements, a building shall be
permitted to cross duly recorded lot lines.
   (b)   The plot, tract or lot faces upon a dedicated street and was
separately owned prior to the effective date of this ordinance or prior to
annexation to the City of Big Spring, whichever is applicable, in which event a
Building Permit for only one (1) main building may be issued on each such
original separately owned parcel without first complying with 1 above.
(Ord. No. 046-2019, § 6, 12-10-2019)
SECTION 4-16. Platting Property Not Permanently Zoned.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not approve any plat of any
subdivision within the city limits of the City of Big Spring until the area
covered by the proposed plat shall have been permanently zoned by the City
Council of the City of Big Spring.
   (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not approve any plat of any
subdivision within any area where a petition or ordinance for annexation or a
recommendation for annexation to the City of Big Spring is pending before the
City Council unless and until such plat shall have been approved by resolution
by the City Council.
SECTION 4-17. Urban Design Review.
   (a)   Purpose. Large-scale buildings often have an extraordinary impact on
the character of an urban neighborhood, as well as the practical functioning of
features within the public realm. The usefulness and value of nearby property
is often impacted by such larger buildings in ways that require closer
examination and evaluation of such impacts. To this end, site plans for certain
proposed buildings are subject to an urban design review in order to ensure the
compatibility of large-scale buildings with neighboring uses, other buildings,
and the public realm.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   A review of urban design considerations shall be required in any of
the following situations:
         a.   Proposed construction comprising ten thousand (10,000) square
feet or more of gross floor area in a new building, or any expansion of an
existing building resulting in a total gross floor area of ten thousand
(10,000) square feet or more.
         b.   Proposed construction of more than one (1) principal building for
multifamily use on a single lot or tract of land.
         c.   Proposed construction of more than one (1) principal building for
single-family or two-family residential use on one (1) lot in a Multifamily
Dwelling District (MF) or where allowed in a commercial zoning district.
      (2)   No permit for construction or expansion of such a building shall be
issued by the Building Official until an urban design review has been completed
in accordance with this Section. All modifications and conditions required as a
result of urban design review shall be incorporated in the construction of the
proposed building and improvement of the surrounding site.
   (c)   Submission of Application. A complete application for examination of
site plans for all buildings subject to urban design review shall be submitted
to the City Planner, along with the appropriate application fee.
   (d)   Review and Action by City Planner. After determining that the
application is complete, the City Planner or his/her designee shall determine
whether the plan meets the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and the
criteria set forth in Subsection (e) below. The City Planner shall approve,
approve with conditions, or deny the application based on these criteria. A
written decision, including affirmative findings on these criteria, shall be
mailed to the applicant.
   (e)   Urban Design Review Criteria. Urban design review by the City Planner
shall be based upon the following:
      (1)   Basic Compliance. The proposed building and site improvements
comply with the dimensional standards required by Article 4 [this Article], any
specific use regulations set forth in Article 6, and all other applicable
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Impacts Minimized. Whether the extent to which the proposed
construction and site improvements minimize adverse effects on adjacent
properties. The maintenance of views and sight lines are valid consideration of
Urban Design Review as is traffic flow on and off the property.
      (3)   Development Patterns. Whether the extent to which the proposed
construction and site improvements would result in a logical and orderly
pattern of urban development.
   (f)   Appeals. An appeal of a site plan to the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall be made in writing within thirty (30) days of the date of
notification to the applicant by the City Planner. The appeal shall be reviewed
by the Planning and Zoning Commission no more than thirty (30) days following
the receipt of written request seeking such an appeal. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall decide on the appealed item no more than sixty (60) days
following the receipt of written request seeking such appeal.
   The decision rendered by the Planning and Zoning Commission may be appealed
to the City Council no more than thirty (30) days from the date in which the
Planning and Zoning Commission renders a decision on the matter. This second
appeal shall be reviewed and decided by City Council no more than sixty (60)
days following receipt of written request for appeal. The affirmative vote of
the majority of City Council members shall be necessary to reverse a decision
of the Planning and Zoning Commission on any appeal of a site plan submitted
for Urban Design Review in accordance with this section.
(Ord. of 11-18-2014)
SECTIONS 4-18—4-20. Reserved.
ARTICLE 5. NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION 5-1. Nonconforming Uses of Lots, Structures, Land and Premises, and
Characteristics of Use.
   (a)   Intent. Within the districts established by this ordinance or
amendments thereto that may exist:
      (1)   Lots;
      (2)   Structures;
      (3)   Uses of land and structures; and
      (4)   Characteristics of use;
which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but uses which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance
or future amendments, it is the intent of this ordinance to permit those
nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival. Any nonconforming use which is discontinued or remains vacant
with an intent to be discontinued for a period of six (6) months shall be
considered to have been abandoned and all nonconforming rights shall cease. The
determination of discontinued use or vacancy shall be by the Building Official.
It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconforming uses shall not be
enlarged, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   Nonconforming uses shall be defined herein as the use of the lots, land,
structures and premises, as well as characteristics of use, which do not
conform to this ordinance or future amendments either as to permitted uses, lot
dimension(s), setbacks, or other supplementary regulations contained herein.
Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure,
or of land, or of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or
enlarged after passage of this ordinance without the approval of the Zoning
Board of Adjustment.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building on
which actual construction was lawfully begun or construction plans were
approved prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance
and upon which actual building construction had been carried on diligently.
Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
Construction plans will continue to be deemed approved for a six (6) month
period following passage of this ordinance. In order to remain approved, actual
construction must be completed within one (1) year.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record on the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area, width, or depth, any or all, that are generally applicable in such
district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements, other than those
applying to area, width, or depth, any or all, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations of GR district. Variance from yard requirements shall be obtained
only through action of the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
   If two (2) or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot area and width, the land involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this ordinance, and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot area and width requirements established by this ordinance,
nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with area or
width below the requirements established herein.
   (c)   Nonconforming Uses of Land or of Land with Minor Structures Only.
Where, at the time of passage of this ordinance, lawful use of land exists
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance, and
where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost
exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the use may be continued as long as
it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance;
      (2)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance;
      (3)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases, then any subsequent
use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance
for the district in which the land is located;
      (4)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
ordinance shall be constructed in connection with such nonconforming use of
land.
   (d)   Nonconforming Use of Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be
built under the terms hereof by reason of restrictions, area, lot coverage,
height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the
structure, such structure may be continued as long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a
manner which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof
may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of its replacement cost at the time of such destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
      (3)   Should any such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, existing
multifamily dwelling developments may be rebuilt in the event of any such
damage or destruction, at the same unit per acre density that existed prior to
such damage or destruction.
   (e)   Nonconforming Uses of structures or of Structures and Premises in
Combination. If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement
cost of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, or of structure and premises
in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
ordinance, the lawful use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building where arranged or designed for such use at the time of the adoption or
amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any
land outside a building.
   (f)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations of the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
SECTION 5-2. Zoning Board of Adjustment.
   (a)   RESERVED.
   (b)   RESERVED.
   (c)   AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD.

         d.   Hear and decide other matters authorized under this ordinance.
      (2)   In authorizing its authority under Subsection (c)(1)a, the Board

   (e)   CRITERIA FOR REVIEW.
      (1)   Appeals Criteria. Appeals to administrative decisions may be made
to the Board. To be effective, the appeal must be made in writing and must be
made in writing and must contain the following information:
         a.   A citation to the specific statute and/or ordinance which is the
subject of the appeal;
         b.   A summary of the decision made by a City Official which is the
basis for the appeal;
         c.   If the administrative official's decision was made in writing, a
copy of the document in which the decision is stated;
         d.   The specific grounds upon which the appeal is based;
         e.   A description of the property affected by the administrative
official's decision sufficient to identify the location and the boundaries of
the property; and
         f.   When the appeal involves the development of a specific tract of
land, a site plan, drawn to scale, showing existing and proposed development of
the property in question.
      (2)   Variance Criteria. To approve an application for a variance, the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall make an affirmative finding that each and
every one of the following criteria is met:
         a.   Special circumstances resulting in unnecessary hardship. A
variance may be granted where special circumstances exist on the property
related to the size, shape, area, topography, surrounding conditions or
location that do not generally apply to other property in the same zoning
district, and that the circumstances are such that strict and literal
application of this Zoning Ordinance would create an unnecessary hardship or
deprive the applicant of reasonable use of the land or building.
         b.   Overriding public interest. A variance may be granted if it will
further an overriding public interest or concern, including, but not limited
to:
            (i)   Preserving the natural environment;
            (ii)   Promoting maintenance or reuse of older urban or historic
buildings; or
            (iii)   Helping to eliminate a nonconforming use at another
location.
         c.   The special conditions and circumstances are not self-imposed
(i.e., do not result from the actions of the applicant or owner).
         d.   That the granting of such variance will not be contrary to the
objectives and principles contained in the Comprehensive Plan and this Zoning
Ordinance, yet where it has been demonstrated that, due to the existence of
legally nonconforming structures, a substantial proportion of other properties
in the same area and zoning district are legally enjoying the conditions that
the applicant is requesting.
         e.   That the variance to be granted is the minimum variance that will
relieve the proven hardship.
         f.   That granting the variance will not adversely affect adjacent
land in a material way.
         g.   That the variance is not grounded solely upon the opportunity to
make the property more profitable or to reduce expense to the current or any
future owner.
         h.   That the variance would not modify or effectively repeal any
development or use regulations set forth in an ordinance or Planned Development
District which are in addition to the generally applicable use and development
regulations set forth in this [Zoning] Ordinance.
         i.   That the variance would only affect a specific parcel of property
and is not of such a general nature as to effectively constitute a change in
zoning.
      (3)   Conditions. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may impose such
conditions on a variance as are necessary to accomplish the purposes of this
Zoning Ordinance, to prevent or minimize adverse impacts upon the public
neighborhoods, and to ensure compatibility of the site with its surroundings.
These conditions may include but are not limited to limitations on size, bulk
and location; standards for landscaping, buffering and screening, lighting and
adequate ingress and egress; cash deposits, bonds and other guarantees of
performance; other on-site improvements; and limitations on the duration or
hours of operations of an allowed use.
      (4)   Variances Not Allowed. In exercising its authority, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance that would create any of the
following effects:
         a.   The effect of the variance on the specific property would
adversely affect the land use pattern as outline by any City land use plan or
policy.
         b.   The variance would be a material detriment to the public welfare
or create injury to the use, enjoyment or value of property in the vicinity.
         c.   The variance is not the minimum variance that will relieve the
proven hardship.
         d.   The variance would allow a use not allowed in the use table for
the district in which the parcel is located.
         e.   The variance will relieve the applicant of conditions or
circumstances that are caused by the illegal subdivision of land, which
subdivision of land caused the property to be unusable for any reasonable
development under the existing regulations.
         f.   The variance will relieve the applicant of conditions or
circumstances that are self-imposed.
         g.   The variance is grounded solely upon the opportunity to make the
property more profitable or to reduce expense to the owner.
         h.   The variance will modify any condition imposed by the Planning
and Zoning Commission or City Council as part of a Specific Use Permit, or
Planned Development District.
         i.   Allowing a variance for a primary or secondary structure to be
located in the front yard building setback when the property in question has
viable alley access, even if such access requires the removal of an existing
wall.
         j.   The written disapproval of any property owner within the 200'
notification of the subject property.
      (5)   Effect of Variance.
         a.   Issuance of a variance shall authorize only the particular
variation which is approved in the variance. A variance shall run with the
land.
         b.   Unless otherwise specified in the variance, an application to
commence construction of the improvements that were the subject of the variance
request must be applied for and approved within twelve (12) months of the
approval date of the variance; otherwise, the variance shall automatically
become null and void. Permitted time frames do not change with successive
owners. Upon written request, only one (1) extension of the twelve (12) month
period may be granted by the Building Official if it is determined that
conditions of the site and immediately surrounding area are substantially
unchanged.
   (f)   JUDICIAL REVIEW OF BOARD DECISION.
      (1)   Any of the following persons may present to a district court,
county court, or county court at law a verified petition stating that the
decision of the Board is illegal in whole or in part and specifying the grounds
of the illegality:
         a.   A person aggrieved by a decision of the Board;
         b.   A taxpayer; or
         c.   An officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality.
      (2)   The petition must be presented within ten (10) days after the date
the decision is filed with the Board.

will ascertain that such building or structure is not subject to damage by
flooding and would not constitute an encroachment hazard or obstacle to the
movement of floodwaters and that such construction would not endanger the value
and safety of other property or the public health and welfare.
   (c)   Any dump, excavation, storage, filling or mining operation within that
portion of a district having a Surface Drainage, "SD," Prefix shall be approved
in writing by the Director of Public Works before such operation is begun.

            (i)   The name and address of the party responsible for the
placement, maintenance and removal of the sign.
            (ii)   All signs not identified will become the responsibility of
the property owner upon whose property the sign is placed. Said responsibility
shall include that of repair, maintenance or removal, as may be necessary.
         c.   The entire sign shall be located at least thirty (30) feet behind
the property line.
         d.   An electronic billboard may be freestanding or located on a
building but shall not exceed the height of the building upon which it is
mounted or thirty (30) feet above ground. However, an electronic billboard
located on property fronting on Interstate Highway 20 may have a maximum height
of forty-two and one-half (42.5) feet.
         e.   No proposed location for an electronic billboard may be approved:
            (i)   On the same side of the street and within one thousand five
hundred (1,500) feet of an existing billboard;
            (ii)   On the same side of the street and within one thousand five
hundred (1,500) feet of any other electronic billboard;
         f.   Maximum sign area.
            (i)   For property with frontage on Interstate 20, the maximum sign
area of an electronic billboard shall not be greater than six hundred seventy
two (672) square feet.
            (ii)   For any other property within the city limits: 1) the
maximum sign area allowed for new construction of an electronic billboard shall
be three hundred (300) square feet, the width of which shall not exceed fifteen
(15) feet; and 2) any legally conforming billboard may be modified to an
electronic billboard so long as it does not exceed three hundred (300) square

advertising; or
            (iii)   Consist of a static image projected upon a stationary
object.
         k.   Operational Requirements.
            (i)   An electronic billboard shall display static messages only.
The dwell or hold time of each message, defined as the interval between each
message change, shall be at least eight (8) seconds. Each message change must
be accomplished within two (2) seconds or less and must occur simultaneously on
the entire sign surface.
            (ii)   The sign shall not be configured to resemble or simulate a
warning or danger signal or any official lights or signs used to control
traffic.
            (iii)   The sign may not display light of such intensity to cause
glare, impair vision, or otherwise result in a nuisance to the public: 1) the
maximum luminous intensity of a sign shall not exceed five thousand (5,000)
nits during daylight hours or five hundred (500) nits between dusk and dawn, as
measured from the sign's surface; and 2) the sign must be equipped with both a
dimmer control or other such electronic control and a photocell or other such
automatic control, which will produce the required illumination change
according to natural ambient conditions.
            (iv)   The sign shall contain a default mechanism that will freeze
the sign in one position if a malfunction occurs.
   (f)   Type F Sign. These signs are used for identification of a new project
such as a subdivision, where property is being sold for the first time to a
user; new buildings, public projects and the like. These signs are not
permanent but may be required for a longer period of time than most temporary
signs.
      (1)   Such signs may be located on any property within the same zoning
district or zoning district allowing the project being advertised; provided,
however, if the project is located on a street with more than two (2) marked
traffic lanes, such signs shall be located only on the property where the
project is located; and
      (2)   In no event shall there be more than one on-site and one off-site
Type F sign for a project; and
      (3)   Such signs shall be removed:
         a.   At the end of three (3) years;
         b.   [At] completion of the project; or
         c.   [At] occupancy of seventy-five (75) percent of the project,
whichever comes first; and
      (4)   Shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height; and
      (5)   Shall be located at least twenty (20) feet behind the curb of any
street; and
      (6)   Out of any visibility triangle; and
      (7)   Not within any parking area; and
      (8)   Any off-site Type F sign shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150)
square feet in area and shall not exceed the total area of all other types of
signs allowed.

SECTION 9-6. Sign Area Management.
   Because signs displayed apart from a building are deemed to have greater
impact than those consisting of symbols attached to a building, a different
method of measurement is provided for different types and combinations of
signs.
   (a)   Type A and B signs, when used alone or in combination with each other:
      (1)   If the sign consists of letters painted on or attached to a
building surface or a Type B sign surface without a background distinguished by
color or internal lighting or enclosed in some type of painted or designed
frame, the allowable sign for Type A or Type B signs shall be the sum of the
area of the rectangles necessary to enclose each feature, symbol, letter, and
number displayed on all exposed sign message surfaces of the sign.
      (2)   If the sign lettering is enclosed in a painted or deigned frame, or
is in an area distinguished from the surface on which it is mounted by color,
or if the sign is internally lighted, then the entire area so lighted, colored,
or framed shall be deemed to be in the area of the sign.
      One exposed sign message surface shall be considered in determining sign
area.
   (b)   Type A signs, when used in conjunction with [a] Type C, D, or E sign:
the allowable sign for Type A signs when used with [a] Type C, D, or E sign
shall be the area of exposure of one (1) sign message surface.
      If such sign consists of letters attached to a building, such sign
message shall be deemed to have a surface area equal to the smallest square,
rectangle or circle which will encompass all symbols, letters and numbers
comprising the sign.
   (c)   Type C, D [E] and F signs. The allowable sign area for Type C, D, E
and F signs shall be the combined area of exposure on one (1) sign message
surface.
      Supports shall not be measured, except for Type B signs, where they shall
be so measured.
   (d)   For all types of signs, allowable sign area based on building or
property frontages shall apply only to each respective street frontage and sign
area for all street frontages shall not be combined along one (1) street
frontage.
   (e)   Signs within PD, Planned Development Districts, shall conform to the
regulations:
      (1)   Of the base district; or
      (2)   In which the permit is granted; or
      (3)   Which is combined therewith; unless
      (4)   A site plan further restricts the signs.
   No sign will be allowed in a district which requires a site plan unless the
site plan shows such sign.
(Ord. of 4-28-2009)
SECTION 9-7. Frontage on More Than One Street.
   (a)   If a use has street frontage on a corner, street frontage for the
purpose of calculation of sign area shall be either:
      (1)   In the case of a sign erected on a building, the frontage of the
building on the street which the sign faces;
      (2)   In the case of a free standing sign more than three hundred (300)
feet from an intersection of any public street, the frontage of the street
closest to the sign, or if equidistant from two (2) or more streets, the
longest of such frontage; or
      (3)   In the case of a free standing sign less than three hundred (300)
feet from an intersection, the frontage of the street which the largest
business building on such lot faces.
   (b)   If a use has street frontage on more than one (1) street, but not on a
corner, such business shall be entitled to signs by formula on each street.
Table 9-1 depicts the type, size and other restrictions of signs generally
allowed within each zoning district, except as may be otherwise provided for a
particular use by the section governing a particular zoning district or by this
Section; and also except as may be otherwise limited by this zoning ordinance.
In case of conflicting provisions, the more restrictive will apply.
(Ord. of 4-28-2009)
SECTION 9-8. Electronic Message Centers.
   In addition to all permit requirements and other regulations contained in
this Chapter, the following regulations shall be applicable to all Electronic
Message Center, EMC, signs.
   Use of an electronic message center (EMC) sign.
   (a)   Operational Limitations.
      (1)   The display of a static message or image and the use of scroll/
travel to display a message or image shall be permitted.
      (2)   The use of any other type of sign transition, such as dissolve/
fade, and the use of frame effects, such as animation whereby text graphics
appear to move or change in size, shall be prohibited except in accordance with
the following:
         a.   Each message or image must be displayed for a minimum of three
seconds; and
         b.   The change of message or image must be accomplished within two
(2) seconds or less and must occur simultaneously on the entire sign face.
   (b)   Size Limitations. In all cases, the use of an electronic message
center (EMC) shall count toward the total area of signs allowed on a property.
      (1)   In the A—MF Districts, a sign permit may be issued for property by
a conforming, non-residential use in accordance with the following:
         a.   An EMC shall not exceed twenty-four (24) square feet in area.
         b.   The EMC may be a single-face or back-to-back sign. The use of a
double-faced EMC (side-by-side or stacked) is prohibited.
         c.   The maximum height of a freestanding EMC shall be fifteen (15)
feet.
         d.   For an EMC mounted on a pole, a clearance of not less than seven
(7) feet from the bottom of the EMC shall be required.
      (2)   In the O, Office and less restrictive zoning districts, excluding
PD zones:
         a.   The area of an EMC shall be limited to fifteen percent (15%) of
the total area of signs permitted for the property or forty-two (42) square
feet, whichever is less.
         b.   The maximum height of a freestanding EMC shall be twenty (20)
feet.
         c.   For an EMC mounted on a pole, a clearance of not less than nine
(9) feet from the bottom of the sign shall be required.
      (3)   For a property which has street frontage on Business Interstate
Highway 20, Business US Highway 87, or FM 700 from Business Interstate Highway
20 to the west side of the intersection of Goliad Street, and is located in the
R, Retail or less restrictive districts, the following shall apply:
         a.   The area of an EMC shall be limited to twenty percent (20%) of
the total signs allowed for the property or seventy-five (75) square feet,
whichever is less.
         b.   The maximum height of a freestanding EMC shall be thirty (30)
feet.
         c.   For an EMC mounted on a pole, a clearance of not less than nine
(9) feet from the bottom of the sign shall be required.
      (4)   For a property which has street frontage on Interstate Highway 20,
or FM 700 from Interstate Highway 20 to the east side of the intersection of
Goliad Street, and is located in R, Retail and less restrictive zoning
district, the following will apply:
         a.   The area of an EMC shall be limited to twenty percent (20%) of
the total signs allowed for the property or seventy-five (75) square feet,
whichever is less.
         b.   The maximum height of a freestanding EMC shall be sixty-five (65)
feet.
         c.   For an EMC mounted on a pole, a clearance of not less than nine
(9) feet from the bottom of the sign shall be required.
   (c)   Illumination. Light from any exterior source intended to illuminate a
sign:
      (1)   Shall be shaded, shielded, or directed in such a way so that the
light intensity or brightness shall not adversely affect the vision of
pedestrian or vehicle operators on public or private streets, driveways, or
parking areas;
      (2)   Shall not interfere with the effectiveness of any official traffic
sign, signal, or device;
      (3)   Shall not contain flashing lights;
      (4)   Shall not exceed five thousand (5,000) nits during daylight hours
or five hundred (500) nits between dusk and dawn, as measured from the sign's
surface; and
      (5)   Shall have an electronic control to produce the required
illumination changes defined above.
(Ord. of 4-28-2009; Ord. No. 046-2022, § 1, 11-9-2022)
SECTION 9-9. Symbols.
   Symbols which are designed as integral part of the building structure, and
symbols and signs which are not visible or readable from the public street
shall not be limited by the sign regulations of the zoning district.
(Ord. of 4-28-2009)
SECTION 9-10. Traffic Control Conflicts.
   No sign or lighting permitted under these regulations shall be erected,
placed or allowed to remain whereby such sign creates confusion, impairs
hearing or vision, or otherwise distracts the automotive driver using any
public right-of-way. Specifically prohibited are:
   (a)   High intensity bare bulb lighting or any lighting which creates a
glare or any sign so placed as to make traffic signs or signals unreadable at
the normal viewing range by a driver on the public street;
   (b)   Signs duplicating colors, characteristics or symbols of traffic signs
or signals, or signs which cause confusion in reading such traffic signs or
signal at normal viewing range;
   (c)   Signs or equipment which produces noises simulating sirens, bells, or

traveling on public streets;
   (d)   This section shall exclude public service signs.
(Ord. of 4-28-2009)
SECTION 9-11. Residential Area Nuisance.
   No sign or lighting permitted under these regulations shall be authorized
whereby such sign or lighting by reason of placement, lack of shielding, noise
generation or character of operation would be adverse to the normal
sensibilities of a person residing on adjacent property or would interfere with
the reasonable use, enjoyment or right of privacy on their property.
Specifically:
   (a)   The source of lighting shall not be directly visible from the adjacent
residential property and light shall be shielded to prevent such exposure;
   (b)   The noise level of signs and lighting fixtures, when measured within
the adjacent dwelling unit, shall not be greater than the noise levels of
equipment customarily in operation in the home, including the air conditioning
and kitchen refrigerators.
(Ord. of 4-28-2009)
SECTION 9-12. Maintenance and Notice of Removal.
   (a)   All signs for which a permit is required, together with all supports,
braces, guys and anchors, shall be kept in repair. The Enforcement Officer may
order the removal of any sign not in accordance with this section, including,
but not limited to:
      (1)   Signs that are dilapidated or in deteriorated condition; any sign
where:
         a.   The message or wording can no longer be clearly read;
         b.   The structural supports or frame members are visibly bent,
broken, dented, or torn;
         c.   The sign face is visibly cracked or, in the case of wood and
similar products, splintered in such a way as to constitute an unsightly or
harmful condition;
         d.   The sign or its elements are twisted or leaning or at angles
other than those at which it was originally erected (such as may result from
being blown or the failure of a structural support); or
         e.   The sign or its elements are not in compliance with the
requirements of the current electrical code and/or the building code of the
city.
      (2)   Signs no longer used. Such signs shall be:

            (i)   Paint which is neutral in color; or
            (ii)   Securely covered as not to tear or be compromised by weather
conditions.
      (3)   For any sign so designated as dilapidated, deteriorated, or
otherwise unsafe, written notice shall be given to remove the sign or bring the
sign into compliance with this chapter, as follows:
         a.   Any written notice to alter or to remove a sign shall be given by
the building official, or his designee, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or written notice served personally upon the owner, lessee, or
person responsible for the sign, or the owner's agent.
         b.   If such order is not complied with within fifteen (15) working
days after the written notice is sent, the building official may initiate
proceedings to revoke the permit and remove the sign at the expense of the
owner, lessee, or person responsible for such sign.
   (b)   Such removal shall be accomplished at the expense of the owner or
person in charge of the sign and/or premises. Failure to comply with such order

(Ord. of 4-28-2009)
SECTION 9-14. Enforcement.
   All signs in existence on and in compliance with the zoning regulations as
of April 28, 2009, shall be exempt from the provisions of [this]
Article 9, except for the maintenance provisions in Section
9-12; provided, however, that all alterations to such existing signs be made in
accordance with, and are subject to, the provisions herein contained. Any
nonconforming sign which is or becomes damaged or deteriorated to a point where

SECTION[S] 9-15—9-17. Reserved.
ARTICLE 10. LANDSCAPING STANDARDS
SECTION 10-1. Purpose.
   The purpose of the landscaping regulations is to:
   (a)   Increase street longevity;
   (b)   Increase ground permeability;
   (c)   Encourage conservation of trees and vegetation;
   (d)   Promote energy and resource conservation;
   (e)   Maintain and increase the value of land; and
   (f)   Enhance the aesthetic quality.
SECTION 10-2. Applicability.
   The provisions of these regulations shall apply to all land within the
corporate limits of the City of Big Spring and within the zoning districts
specified in this section and shall be applied as follows:
   (a)   When a building permit for a new structure is required, or when a
paving permit for a new parking area is required.
   (b)   When a building permit for the remodeling, renovation, or expansion of
an existing structure that increases the gross floor area by fifty percent
(50%) or more or a paving permit that increases the number of off-street
parking spaces by fifty percent (50%) or more is required.
   As a minimum standard, this landscaping ordinance shall apply to all zoning
districts except the A, Agricultural District, the SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3,
Single-Family Districts, the 2F, Two-Family District, and the GR, General
Residential District. The CA, Central Area District, is also exempt from the
provisions of this Article.
   (c)   Minimum standards for Planned Developments shall be determined at such
time as the approval of a Planned Development site plan is requested or a
Planned Development ordinance is established.
SECTION 10-3. Landscaping Requirements.
   (a)   Landscaping shall be provided within the front and side yard setbacks
as well as adjacent public rights-of-way. A graphic illustration of the
required landscape area is provided in Appendix A, #13 (sic) as an example. A
minimum of all of the adjacent right-of-way or ten (10) feet, whichever is
greater, excluding existing and approved future driveways, as well as an
additional eight percent (8%) of the lot area, shall be utilized for
landscaping.
   (b)   Use of low water using plant materials and landscaping (xeriscaping)
is encouraged. An application may be made for variance from the required plant
materials contained herein if a xeriscape plan is substituted and approved by
the Building Official.
SECTION 10-4. Irrigation.
   All required landscaping shall be irrigated by either a hose attachment
within one hundred (100) feet of all landscaping or an underground sprinkler
system. If an underground sprinkler system is utilized, it shall be designed in
such a manner as to minimize water runoff into adjoining streets.
SECTION 10-5. Plant Materials Required.
   (a)   Landscaping shall consist of a combination of two (2) or more of the
following types of plant materials, including, but not limited to, planted
grass, trees, shrubs, ground cover, and/or other forms of plant material.
   (b)   Trees with a minimum of two-inch (2") caliper (measured one-foot above
grade) shall be provided and replaced as necessary at the ratio of one (1) tree
per fifty (50) linear feet of street frontage, or fraction thereof. However, no
tree shall be required where: all street frontage is used for driveway
entrance.
   (c)   All existing trees of two-inch (2") caliper or greater will be counted
towards satisfying the requirements of this ordinance, as long as such trees do
not endanger safety, health and public welfare. No tree or shrub shall be
placed in such a manner as to create a hazard to vehicular traffic.
   In accordance with Section
10-2, all parking lots with less than one hundred one (101) parking spaces
shall contain a minimum of one (1) tree per ten (10) parking spaces. For new or
expanding parking lots where the number of parking spaces exceeds one hundred
(100), a sliding scale of parking spaces per tree may be applied as follows:
 
Number of Parking Spaces Required Tree Ratio
> 100 but < 200          one per ten for first 100 spaces; one per twenty-five
                         spaces thereafter
> 201 but <300           one per ten for first 100 spaces; one per twenty-five
                         spaces thereafter
> 301                    one per ten up to 300 spaces; one per forty spaces
                         thereafter
 
   There may be circumstances in which the placement of trees in new or
expanded parking facilities may be difficult or undesirable. In order to
provide for a similar landscaping effect, parking lot trees may be waived in
lieu of additional trees or larger caliper trees placed in the front and/or
side yard setback area. In no case shall an alternative landscape proposal
result in a net reduction of the tree requirement as measured in total tree
caliper inches. Such a proposal may be submitted as part of the landscaping
plan to be administratively approved by the Director of Public Works or his
designee. Appeal of any such administrative decision may be made to the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (d)   All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy and growing
condition.
SECTION 10-6. Landscaping Plan.
   (a)   Prior to the issuance of a building permit or prior to the issuance of
a paving permit, two (2) copies of a Landscaping Plan shall be submitted to the
Building Official for review and approval. The Landscaping Plan shall be drawn
to scale, including all dimensions, and shall meet each of the following
requirements:
      (1)   Clearly show the location and size of any buildings or structures;
      (2)   Clearly show the location of all paved off-street parking areas;
and
      (3)   Clearly show any fencing and the location, size, and description of
all landscaping materials to be utilized.
   (b)   No Certificate of Occupancy and/or paving permit shall be issued
unless the landscaping plan required herein complies with this Section.
SECTION 10-7. Exceptions.
   (a)   When seasonal conditions warrant, the Building Official may issue a
temporary certificate of occupancy for up to one hundred and eighty (180) days
pending completion of landscaping. No final certificate of occupancy shall be
issued prior to completion of landscape requirements.
   (b)   Upon application and hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
grant waivers from the application of these regulations on the finding of
extreme hardship.

these regulations.

specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into
the official minutes of the meeting(s) at which such variance is granted.

health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice served.

area backs up to a railroad right-of-way, a high pressure gasoline, oil and gas
line, an arterial street, an industrial area, or other land use which has a
depreciating effect on the residential use of property, and where no marginal
access street or other street is provided at the areas of such lot, additional
depth may be required by the Commission. In no case shall a residential lot
depth in excess of one hundred seventy-five (175) feet be required. Where a
residential lot sides to any of the above, additional width may be required by

federal and state minimum standards.
   F.   Sidewalks shall not be required in any of the following cases:
      (i)   If it is apparent that the strict application of requiring sidewalk
would result in discontinuous strips of concrete thereby serving as a detriment
rather than a community asset; or
      (ii)   If curb and gutter is not present and the addition of sidewalks
will impede drainage.
   G.   New sidewalk shall substantially match the location of existing
sidewalk in the city's right-of-way. A transition from a sidewalk narrower than
five (5) feet shall begin on the portion of city right-of-way adjacent to the

building to, within thirty (30) days:
      1.   Secure the structure from unauthorized entry; or
      2.   Repair, remove or demolish the structure within thirty (30) days,

be reasonably performed within thirty (30) days.
      3.   If the owner establishes that the work cannot be reasonably
completed in thirty (30) days and the Hearing Board determines that additional
time is necessary, the Hearing Board shall establish specific time schedules

         A.   Submits a detailed plan and time schedule for the work at the
hearing; and
         B.   Establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be
completed within ninety (90) days because of the scope and complexity of the

remove or demolish the structure, the Hearing Board shall require the owner,
