material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Sec. 1-14. Severability of parts of Code.

sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code, all
ordinances, present or future, are severable and, if any phrase, clause,
sentence, paragraph or section of this Code, or of any ordinance, shall be
declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of
competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the
remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, or
of such ordinance, since the same would have been enacted by the city council
without the incorporation of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause,
sentence, paragraph or section.

(Code 2014, § 8-159; Ord. No. 297, § 2, 5-31-1991)
Sec. 8-160. Zones.
In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the
approach surfaces, transition surface, horizontal surface and conical surface
as they apply to the city municipal airport. Such zones are shown on a zoning
map consisting of one sheet, prepared by the state department of aviation and
dated March 28, 1990, which is attached to the ordinance from which this
article is derived and is on file in the city secretary's office and made a
part hereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      (1)   Approach zones. Runway 18/36 approach zone is established beneath
the approach surface at the ends of Runway 18/36 on the city municipal airport
for nonprecision instrument landings and take-offs. The inner edge of the
approach zone shall have a width of 500 feet which coincides with the width of
the primary surface at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway,
widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance
of 5,000 feet beyond each end of the primary surface, its centerline being the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (2)   Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established beneath
the transition surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface as
indicated on the zoning map. Transition surfaces, symmetrically located on
either side of runways, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map.
Transitional surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway
centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven to one from
the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of approach surfaces.
      (3)   Horizontal zone. The area beneath a horizontal plane 150 feet above
the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of Runway 18/36 and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to
those arcs.
      (4)   Conical zone. The area beneath the conical surface extending
outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of
20 to one for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
(Code 2014, § 8-160; Ord. No. 297, § 3, 5-31-1991)
Sec. 8-161. Height limitations.
   (a)   Established. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no
structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be
allowed to grow in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of
the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable
height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as
follows:
      (1)   Approach zones. Runway 18/36 one foot in height for each 20 feet in
horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the elevation of the primary
surface and extending to a point 5,000 feet from the end of the primary
surface.
      (2)   Transition zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 292 feet above mean sea level.
      (3)   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation, or a height of 442 feet above mean sea level.
      (4)   Conical zone. Slope 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
   (b)   Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be
construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or
structure to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land.
(Code 2014, § 8-161; Ord. No. 297, § 4, 5-31-1991)
Sec. 8-162. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this article in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the
airport.
(Code 2014, § 8-162; Ord. No. 297, § 5, 5-31-1991)
Sec. 8-163. Hazard marking and lighting.
If the administrative agency or board of adjustment considers it reasonable in
the circumstances and advisable to accomplish the purposes of this article, the
agency or board may require in a permit or a variance granted under this
article that the owner of a structure or object of natural growth allow the
political subdivision, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain on
the structure or object of natural growth any markers and lights necessary to
indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.
(Code 2014, § 8-163)
State law reference(s)—Similar provision, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §
241.035.
Sec. 8-164. Nonconforming uses.
   (a)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or object of natural growth not
conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from
which this article is derived, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of
any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the
construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure that received a
determination of no hazard by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under
14 CFR 77, before the regulations were adopted, the construction or alteration
of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this
article is derived, and is diligently prosecuted.
   (b)   Markings and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or object of natural growth
is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance
thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city
manager, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city.

State law reference(s)—Nonconforming uses and structures, V.T.C.A., Local
Government Code § 241.019.
Sec. 8-165. Permits and variances.
   (a)   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in this subsection and
subsection (b) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of
land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall
be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been
applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the
purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to
permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with
the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been
approved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. In the area lying
within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be
required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above
the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits
prescribed for such zones.
      (1)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this article except as set forth in section
8-161(5).
   (b)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of any airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to
air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which
this article is derived, or any amendments thereto or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
   (c)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the city manager
determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more
than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall
be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (d)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any object of natural growth, or use his
property in violation of the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply
to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations in question.
The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
FAA as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation
facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances
shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and the
relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but do substantial
justice, and be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered
by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished
to the city municipal airport advisory board for advice as to the aeronautical
effects of the variance. If the city municipal airport advisory board does not
respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of
adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
   (e)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable by the city manager or the board of
adjustment to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the
circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or
tree in question to allow the city manager to install, operate, and maintain,
at the expense of the city, such markings and lights as may be necessary.

city manager upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required by
this article to be submitted to the city manager shall be promptly considered
and granted or denied. Applications for variances shall be made to the board of
adjustment by first filing said application for variance with the city manager
who shall forthwith transmit said application to the board of adjustment for
determination.

that a decision of the city manager is an improper application of these
regulations, may appeal to the board of adjustment.
   (b)   All appeals hereunder must be taken within a reasonable time as
provided by the rules of the board of adjustment, by filing with the city
manager a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The city manager
shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   (c)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the city manager certifies to the board of adjustment,
after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the opinion of the city manager,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed except by order of the board of adjustment on notice to the city
manager and on due cause shown.
   (d)   The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and
decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   (e)   The board of adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of this
article, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination, as may be appropriate under the
circumstances.

ownership interest or control of the sexually oriented business and all persons
owning the property upon which the sexually oriented business is located.

compliance with this section. A transfer application must be filed within 30
days of any change of persons designated on the current permit. A transfer
application shall allow continuation of business under an existing permit while
a new application is being processed. Any transfer application shall require

DIVISION 2. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 22-31. Statutory authorization.
The legislature of the state has in V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315 delegated the
responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses.
(Code 2014, § 22-19; Ord. No. 292A, art. 1, § A, 2-12-1990)
Sec. 22-32. Findings of fact.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Code 2014, § 22-20; Ord. No. 292A, art. 1, § B, 2-12-1990)
Sec. 22-33. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
(Code 2014, § 22-21; Ord. No. 292A, art. 1, § C, 2-12-1990)
Sec. 22-34. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning:
   Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial
fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by
high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
   Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the
flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and
alluvial fan flooding can occur.
   Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO Zone on a
community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given
year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map
(FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for
publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-
99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
   Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
   Development means any manmade change to improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   Elevated building. The term "elevated building" means:
      (1)   A nonbasement building:
         a.   Built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO,
AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a
building in Zone V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of
the water; and
         b.   Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity
of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood.
      (2)   In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, the
term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or
solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of floodwaters.
      (3)   In the case of Zone V1-30, VE, or V, the term "elevated building"
also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of the term "elevated
building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls
if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.
   Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates,
structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective
date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that
date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing
structures."
   Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on
which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   Flood insurance study (FIS) is the official report provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface
elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
   Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which
funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the area within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of
the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane
tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood
modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
standards.
   Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source. (See Flooding.)
   Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but
not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and
floodplain management regulations.
   Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term "floodplain
management" describes such state or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
   Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   Floodway(regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than a designated height.
   Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term "functionally dependent" includes only docking facilities, port facilities
that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and
ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term
storage or related manufacturing facilities.
   Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   Historic structure means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         a.   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         b.   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.
   Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle.
   Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels)
of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program,
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which
base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures
for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of
a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projections;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before start of construction of
the improvement. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include
either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this
article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
   Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program
is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
   Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.

Sec. 22-89. Variance procedures.
   (a)   The appeal board, as established by the community, shall hear and
render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
article.
   (b)   The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this article.
   (c)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal
such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (d)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
   (e)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this division.
   (f)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in section
22-88(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (g)   Upon consideration of the factors noted in subsections (a) through (f)
of this section and the intent of this division, the appeal board may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purpose and objectives of this division (section 22-21).
   (h)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (i)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (j)   Prerequisites for granting variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (k)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use, provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in subsections (a) through (i) of this
section are met; and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

DIVISION 5. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 22-107. General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required for
all new construction and substantial improvements:
      (1)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
      (2)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      (4)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      (5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
      (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Code 2014, § 22-107; Ord. No. 292A, art. 5, § A, 2-12-1990)
Sec. 22-108. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section
22-51,
22-87(8) or
22-109(c), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection (1), as
proposed in section
22-88(a)(1), is satisfied.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
      (3)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   Manufactured homes.
          a.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A
on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices
which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
         b.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites:
            1.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            2.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
            3.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
            4.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         c.   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with
Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the
provisions of this subsection (4) of this section be elevated so that either:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the
base flood elevation; or
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (5)   Recreational vehicles. It is required that recreational vehicles
placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
         a.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         c.   Meet the permit requirements of section
22-88(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes
in subsection (4) of this section.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
(Code 2014, § 22-108; Ord. No. 292A, art. 5, § B, 2-12-1990)
Sec. 22-109. Standards for subdivision proposals.
   (a)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 22-32 through 22-34.
   (b)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of sections 22-52, 22-88, and the provisions of this
division.
   (c)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever
is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section
22-51 or section
22-87(8).
   (d)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   (e)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
(Code 2014, § 22-109; Ord. No. 292A, art. 5, § C, 2-12-1990)
Sec. 22-110. Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
22-51 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
         a.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
         b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in section
22-88(a)(1), are satisfied.
      (4)   Require within Zone AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
(Code 2014, § 22-110; Ord. No. 292A, art. 5, § D, 2-12-1990)
Sec. 22-111. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
22-51 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

made within an existing city right-of-way, an estimate of these off-site costs
shall be prepared and submitted along with the plans. Subject to city council
approval, cost for such off-site improvements shall be prorated to the extent
that the owner pays for a percentage of the off-site cost based on the increase
of the discharge originating within the limits of his addition.
         e.   Where it is anticipated that additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision will overload design/storm runoff at an existing
downstream drainage facility, whether natural or manmade, and result in
hazardous conditions, the city council may withhold approval of the subdivision
until appropriate provision has been made to eliminate the problem, and plans
shall be provided which include all necessary off-site improvements including
storm sewer systems, channel grading, driveway adjustments, culvert
improvements, etc.

watershed warrants, unit hydrograph techniques, utilizing a design approved by
the director of public works, shall be used.
         d.   Storm drainage shall be designed for ultimate development of the
watershed, and therefore, runoff coefficients used shall consider these fully
developed conditions.
         e.   The comprehensive plan, official zoning map, and other land use
plans shall be used to determine the ultimate development.
         f.   Values for the runoff coefficient to be used in the determination
of stormwater runoff shall be as indicated in table C (see section
40-74).
         g.   Design storm frequencies to be used in the design of drainage
facilities shall be as indicated in table D (see section
40-74).
      (7)   Drainageways.
         a.   Concrete-lined drainageways in lieu of enclosed storm sewers may
be installed when the director of public works, on the basis of competent
engineering evidence submitted to him in accordance with criteria and
guidelines previously mentioned, concludes that the installation of enclosed
storm sewers as herein established is not required for the protection of
health, safety, and general welfare.
         b.   Construction and installation of such open drainageways, along
with any improvements required upon natural drainageways, shall be totally at
the developer's expense and shall conform with city standard specifications.
      (8)   Drainage and storm sewers.
         a.   Drainage structures shall be constructed in such locations and of
such size dimensions to adequately serve the subdivision and associated
drainage area.
         b.   In new subdivisions, the developer shall provide all the
necessary easements and rights-of-way required for drainage structures,
including storm sewer and open or paved channels.
         c.   Storm sewers and curb inlets.
            1.   Storm sewers shall be provided and curb inlets located so as
to properly drain all streets and intersections.
            2.   Permissible spread of water:
               (i)   Commercial collector and thoroughfare streets widths above
41 feet B-B. The flow of water in gutters of these collector streets widths
above 41 feet B-B shall be limited so that two standard lanes will remain clear
during the peak runoff from the design storm. Inlets shall be located at low
points or wherever the flow exceeds the two standard lane requirement. Gutter
depression at the inlet is discouraged, but shall not exceed five inches in any
case. The design storm will have a ten-year return frequency. Example: Street
width 41 feet to 49 feet—two 12-foot traffic lanes to remain clear.
               (ii)   Residential collector streets (41 foot B-B). The flow of
water in gutters or a residential collector street shall be limited so that one
standard lane will remain clear during the peak runoff from the design storm.
Inlets shall be located at low points or wherever the flow exceeds the one
standard lane requirement. Gutter depression at the inlet is discouraged, but
shall not exceed five inches in any case. The design storm will have a ten-year
return frequency. Example: Street width 41 feet—one 12-foot traffic lane to
remain clear.
         d.   Residential street (33 feet B-B). The flow of water in gutters of
a residential street shall be limited to a flow at the curb of six inches or
wherever the street is just covered, whichever is the least depth. Outlets
shall be located at low points, or wherever the gutter flow exceeds the
permissible spread of water. In no case shall the gutter depression at the
inlet exceed five inches. The design storm will have a ten-year return
frequency.
      (9)   Detention ponds.
         a.   A detention pond shall be required when the director of public
works concludes that such installation is necessary. The design will be
approved by the director of public works.
         b.   Construction, installation and maintenance of the detention pond
shall be at the developer's expenses and shall conform to city standard
specifications.
         c.   Ponds will provide for a temporary storage of stormwater runoff
and shall be designed with post-development peak rates of discharge being the
same as pre development peak rates of discharge for a ten-year storm event or
frequency at each point of discharge from the site. Runoff is released at a
controlled rate which shall not exceed the capacities of the existing drainage
systems or the predeveloped peak runoff rate of the site, whichever is less.
         d.   A barrier-type fence, at least six feet in height, is required to
prevent access to a detention pond facility. A detention pond facility shall
have interior slopes greater than 4H:1V. A gate, a minimum of 12 feet in width,
is required to allow access for maintenance equipment.
         e.   A ten-foot maintenance access strip is required around the
perimeter of the detention pond facility. This ten-foot strip shall not have a
post-construction slope greater than 15 percent. A permanent maintenance
equipment access ramp is also required with a slope not exceeding 4H:1V. The
minimum ramp width is ten feet.
         f.   Corrective maintenance is required if a pond does not drain
completely within 60 hours of the cessation of stormwater inflow. No standing
water is allowed.
   (l)   Bridges.
      (1)   Where bridges are needed to serve minor streets, the total cost of
the bridge shall be paid by the developer.
      (2)   For other thoroughfares, the cost of bridges shall be the
responsibility of the developer, unless other cost-sharing programs with city
are in effect.
   (m)   Crosswalks/ways.
      (1)   Crosswalks/ways ten feet in width shall be dedicated where deemed
necessary by the director of public works to provide circulation or access to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, and transportation and other community
facilities, or to provide pedestrian circulation within the subdivision.
      (2)   Crosswalks/ways shall be provided with a concrete sidewalk four
feet wide, with the expense of such construction borne by the developer, and to
be constructed according to city standard specifications.
   (n)   Streetlight placement, standards and development policy.
      (1)   Street type. Streetlights shall be placed in accordance with the
following:
         a.   Typical location of lights shall be at the intersection of two
arterial streets; at the intersection of an arterial and a collector street;
and at the intersection of two collector streets, as reflected on the city's
current major thoroughfare street plan;
         b.   In the turnaround of cul-de-sacs where cul-de-sac length is
longer than 300 feet;
         c.   At alley/street intersections, as recommended by the director of
public works.
      (2)   Safety considerations. Streetlights shall be placed in accordance
with the following safety considerations:
         a.   To illuminate street curves; significant topographic conditions,
alleys or other safety hazards to the public, as recommended by the director of
public works, chief of police or fire chief;
         b.   To illuminate documented high-crime areas, as recommended by the
chief of police;
         c.   To illuminate streets at locations where the traffic count
exceeds 5,000 vehicles per day, or a location with significant accident
history, as recommended by the director of public works.
      (3)   Spacing. Streetlights shall be placed in accordance with the
following spacing consideration:
         a.   Typical spacing of lights shall be; one per intersection at the
intersections described in subsection (n)(1) of this section;
         b.   Additional lights shall be provided along arterial and collector
streets, with a minimum spacing between lights of 300 feet provided;
         c.   If resulting block length is over 600 feet but less than
increments of 300 feet, the light shall be placed in mid-block to the degree
practical;
         d.   In a cul-de-sac turn-around, if the cul-de-sac length is longer
than 300 feet.
      (4)   Street type; light size; light type relationship.
 
Street Type                             Light Size/Lumens Light Type
Thoroughfare (heavy traffic)            400w/50,000       HPS
Arterial (medium traffic)               200w/22,000       HPS
Collector (residential and low traffic) 150w/16,500       HPS
 
      (5)   Timing of streetlight installation.
         a.   New subdivisions.
            1.   The developer shall submit a street light plan as a part of
the final subdivision plat package in conjunction with the utility plans and in
conformance with these standards.
            2.   The staff shall review, coordinate with Gulf States Utility
(Energy), and recommend street light plans to the city council.
            3.   The developer shall pay an additional increment required for
any additional charges: underground; metal pole; special fixture; additional
electricity charge for installation, in conjunction with the final plat phase.
Gulf States Utility will prepare an estimate of the cost difference between
standard overhead street lighting and special developer requirements. Developer
will be responsible for making a nonrefundable payment as aid-to-construction
to the utility, in advance of construction, based on the estimate.
            4.   Installation will be coordinated with building permits issued
in the areas, with priority given to arterial and collector streets in the
subdivision to facilitate circulation; within each block face, when 50 percent
of lots have been permitted, lights shall be installed. This light installation
schedule may be accelerated in accordance with an agreement made with the
developer whereby the developer pays the city the full cost of power during the
time period necessary to reach this level of permitting.
            5.   The city council may disapprove any subdivision where the
developer fails to comply with the standards defined in subsections (n)(5)a.1
through 4 of this section.
         b.   Sparsely developed areas.
            1.   A request shall be submitted to the office of the director of
public works in conformance with the criteria.
            2.   Installation will be attempted as soon as possible, provided
the city council budgets the funds to allow installation.
      (6)   Other locations. In those instances when the criteria of subsection
(n)(5)a and b of this section do not warrant streetlight placement in a
particular location where property owners or residents desire a streetlight,
the city encourages privately-funded and privately-maintained lights by
neighborhood residents. All privately-funded lights shall be totally owned and
maintained by the private property owners or residents. All utilities shall be
entirely paid for by the private property owner or residents. The city shall
never be obligated to pay for the maintenance or utilities of any privately-
funded light.
      (7)   Administration. The administrator of this section shall be the
director of public works. The administrator shall make the final determination
whether a street light is warranted under these criteria and will establish a
procedure for review of requests.
      (8)   Appeal. The decision of the director of public works may, within 30
days of that decision, be appealed to the city council by submitting a written
notice of appeal to the city manager.

said director of public works withdraw sums from said escrow account in amounts
equal to the total amount of the work performed on such project, less ten
percent of the amount thereof less all such previous withdrawals, which said
sum so retained in said escrow account, until the completion of such
installation by said developer and approval thereof by said director of public
works.
            3.   The escrow agreement shall also provide that the developer
will complete such improvements within 180 days after approval of the plat.
            4.   Said escrow agreement shall be further conditioned as may be
reasonable and shall be in the form prescribed by the city attorney.

public works and payable to the city, a bond, executed by a surety company
holding a license to do business in the state, or an escrow account payable to
the city, and acceptable to him, in an amount equal to ten percent of the cost
of the improvements required, as estimated by the developer's engineer and
approved by the director of public works, conditioned that the developer will
maintain such improvements in good condition for a period of one year after
acceptance of the improvements by the city.
      (2)   Such bond shall be approved as to form and legality by the city
attorney.
   (e)   Time extensions.
      (1)   Where good cause exists, the director of public works may grant one

The abatement criteria used will be the one that abates the larger amount.
      (2)   If a modernization project includes facility replacement, the value
eligible for abatement shall be the value of the new units less the value of
the old units.
   (h)   Economic qualification. In order to be eligible for designation as a
reinvestment zone and receive tax abatement, the planned improvements:
      (1)   Must increase the value of the property a minimum of $500,000.00;
      (2)   Must be expected to create, retain, or prevent the loss of
employment on a permanent basis in the county;

Sec. 42-74. Application.
   (a)   Any present or potential owner of taxable property in an affected
jurisdiction may request the creation of a reinvestment zone and tax abatement
by filing a written application with the presiding officer of the governing
body of the affected jurisdiction.
   (b)   The application shall consist of a completed application form
accompanied by a general description of proposed use and the general nature and
extent of the modernization, expansion, or new improvements to be undertaken; a
descriptive list of the improvements which will be part of the facility; a map
and property description; and a time schedule for undertaking and completing
the planned improvements. In the case of modernization, a statement of the
assessed value of the real and personal property of the facility shall be given
for the tax year immediately preceding the application. The application form
may require such financial and other information as the governing body of the
affected jurisdiction deems appropriate for evaluating the financial capacity
and other factors of the applicant.
   (c)   Upon receipt of a completed application, the officer with whom the
application was filed shall notify in writing the presiding officer of the
governing body of each affected jurisdiction. Before acting upon the
application, each affected jurisdiction shall through a public hearing afford
the applicant and the designated representative of any affected jurisdiction
the opportunity to show cause why the abatement should or should not be
granted. Notice of the public hearing shall be clearly identified on an agenda
of the governing body to be posted at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
   (d)   After receipt of an application for creation of a reinvestment zone
and application for abatement, the affected jurisdiction shall prepare or cause
to be prepared a feasibility study setting out the impact of the proposed
reinvestment zone and tax abatement. The feasibility study shall include, but
not be limited to, an estimate of the economic effect of the creation of the
zone and the abatement of the taxes and the benefit to the eligible
jurisdiction and the property to be included in the zone. The costs of such
feasibility study shall be borne by the Madison County Economic Development
Corporation (MCEDC).
   (e)   The governing body of the affected jurisdiction shall not establish a
reinvestment zone for the purpose of abatement if it finds that the request for
the abatement was filed after the commencement of construction, alteration, or
installation of improvements related to a proposed modernization, expansion, or
new facility.
   (f)   Variance. Requests for variance from the provisions of section
42-73 (a) and (g) may be made in writing to the presiding officer of the
governing body of the affected jurisdiction. Such request shall include a
complete description of the circumstances explaining why the applicant should
be granted a variance. Approval of a request for a variance requires a two-
thirds vote of the governing body.
(Code 2014, § 42-74; Ord. No. 569, exh. A, § 3, 8-9-2002)
Sec. 42-75. Reinvestment zone advisory committee.
   (a)   There is hereby created a reinvestment zone advisory committee (RZAC).
The committee shall be composed of seven members. Two members shall be members
of the county economic development corporation, two members shall be from the
county commissioners court (county judge and a county commissioner or their
designees), two members shall be from the city council (mayor and the city
manager or their designees), and one member shall be appointed by the county
chamber of commerce. The initial members of the RZAC shall be appointed as soon
as possible after the adoption of these guidelines and criteria, and the RZAC
shall hold its initial meeting as soon as a majority of its membership has been
appointed. The RZAC may select from one of its members a chairperson and a
vice-chairperson and any other officers that the RZAC deems necessary to
perform its functions and duties.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the RZAC to provide assistance and advice to
all governing bodies of taxing entities in the county and to the county
economic development corporation, and the county Chamber of Commerce on matters
related to tax abatement and reinvestment zones created in the county. The RZAC
shall also provide information and assistance to applicants and potential
applicants for tax abatements and reinvestment zones. The RZAC may make an
initial review of each application for tax abatement made under these
guidelines and criteria and make recommendations to the governing bodies
regarding the sufficiency of the application and the value and term of
abatement to be authorized.
(Code 2014, § 42-75; Ord. No. 569, exh. A, § 4, 8-9-2002)
Sec. 42-76. Public hearing.
   (a)   Should any affected jurisdiction be able to show cause in the public
hearing why the granting of abatement will have a substantial adverse effect on
its bonds, tax revenue, service capacity, or the provision of service, that
showing shall be reason for the governing body to deny any designation of the
reinvestment zone, the granting of abatement, or both.
   (b)   Neither a reinvestment zone nor abatement agreement shall be
authorized if it is determined that:
      (1)   There would be a substantial adverse effect on the provision of
services or on the tax base;
      (2)   The applicant has insufficient financial capacity;
      (3)   Planned or potential use of the property would constitute a hazard
to public safety, health, or morals; or
      (4)   A planned or potential use of the property would constitute a
violation of other codes or laws.
(Code 2014, § 42-76; Ord. No. 569, exh. A, § 5, 8-9-2002)
Sec. 42-77. Assignment.
Abatement may be transferred and assigned by the holder to a new owner or
lessee of the same facility upon the approval of the governing body, subject to
the financial capacity of the assignee and, provided that all conditions and
obligations in the abatement agreement are guaranteed by the execution of a new
contractual agreement with the affected jurisdiction. No assignment or transfer
shall be approved if the parties to the existing agreement, the new owner or
new lessee are liable to the county or any affected jurisdiction for
outstanding taxes or other obligations. Approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
(Code 2014, § 42-77; Ord. No. 569, exh. A, § 8, 8-9-2002)
Sec. 42-78. Duration/review.
   (a)   These guidelines and criteria are effective upon the date of the
ordinance from which they are derived and will remain in force for two years,
at which time all reinvestment zones and tax abatement contracts created
pursuant to its provisions will be reviewed by the governing body to determine
whether the goals have been achieved. Based on that review, the guidelines and
criteria will be renewed, modified, or eliminated, providing that such action
will not affect existing contracts.
   (b)   This policy is mutually exclusive of existing industrial district
contracts and owners of real property in areas deserving of special attention,
as agreed by the affected jurisdictions.

State law reference(s)—Property tax code, V.T.C.A., Tax Code § 1.01 et seq.
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Secs. 42-100—42-126. Reserved.
DIVISION 2. TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY
Sec. 42-127. Goods-in-transit.
   (a)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except
where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
   Bailee and warehouse have the meanings assigned by V.T.C.A., Business and
Commerce Code § 7.102.
   Dealer's motor vehicle inventory, dealer's vessel and outboard motor
inventory, dealer's heavy equipment inventory, and retail manufactured housing
inventory have the meanings assigned by V.T.C.A., Tax Code ch. 23, subch. B
(V.T.C.A., Tax Code § 23.11 et seq.).
   Goods-in-transit means tangible personal property that:
      (1)   Is acquired in or imported into the state to be forwarded to
another location in the state or outside this state;
      (2)   Is stored under a contract of bailment by a public warehouse
operator at one or more public warehouse facilities in the state that are not
in any way owned or controlled by the owner of the personal property for the
account of the person who acquired or imported the property;
      (3)   Is transported to another location in the state or outside the
state not later than 175 days after the date the person acquired the property
in or imported the property into the state; and
      (4)   Does not include oil, natural gas, petroleum products, aircraft,
dealer's motor vehicle inventory, dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory,
dealer's heavy equipment inventory, or retail manufactured housing inventory.
   Location means a physical address.
   Petroleum product means a liquid or gaseous material that is an immediate
derivative of the refining of oil or natural gas.
   Public warehouse operator means a person that:
      (1)   Is both a bailee and a warehouse; and
      (2)   Stores under a contract of bailment, at one or more public
warehouse facilities, tangible personal property that is owned by other persons
solely for the account of those persons and not for the operator's account.
   (b)   A person is entitled to an exemption from taxation of the appraised
value of that portion of the person's property that consists of goods-in-
transit.
   (c)   The exemption provided by subsection (b) of this section is subtracted
from the market value of the property determined under V.T.C.A., Tax Code §
23.01 or 23.12, as applicable, to determine the taxable value of the property.
   (d)   Except as provided by subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the
chief appraiser shall determine the appraised value of goods-in-transit under
this subsection. The chief appraiser shall determine the percentage of the
market value of tangible personal property owned by the property owner and used
for the production of income in the preceding calendar year that was
contributed by goods-in-transit. For the first year in which the exemption
applies to a taxing unit, the chief appraiser shall determine that percentage
as if the exemption applied in the preceding year. The chief appraiser shall
apply that percentage to the market value of the property owner's tangible
personal property used for the production of income for the current year to
determine the appraised value.
   (e)   In determining the market value of goods-in-transit that in the
preceding year were stored in the state, the chief appraiser shall exclude the
cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became
component parts of the goods-in-transit but were not themselves goods-in-
transit or that were not transported to another location in the state or
outside the state before the expiration of 175 days after the date they were
brought into the state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner
in the state. For component parts held in bulk, the chief appraiser may use the
average length of time a component part was held by the owner of the component
parts during the preceding year at a location in the state that was not owned
by or under the control of the owner of the component parts in determining
whether the component parts were transported to another location in the state
or outside the state before the expiration of 175 days.
   (f)   If the property owner was not engaged in transporting goods-in-transit
to another location in the state or outside the state for the entire preceding
year, the chief appraiser shall calculate the percentage of the market value
described in subsection (d) of this section, for the portion of the year in
which the property owner was engaged in transporting goods-in-transit to
another location in the state or outside the state.
   (g)   If the property owner or the chief appraiser demonstrates that the
method provided by subsection (d) of this section significantly understates or
overstates the market value of the property qualified for an exemption under
subsection (b) of this section, in the current year, the chief appraiser shall
determine the market value of the goods-in-transit to be exempt by determining,
according to the property owner's records and any other available information,
the market value of those goods-in-transit owned by the property owner on
January 1 of the current year, excluding the cost of equipment, machinery, or
materials that entered into and became component parts of the goods-in-transit
but were not themselves goods-in-transit or that were not transported to
another location in the state or outside the state before the expiration of 175
days after the date they were brought into the state by the property owner or
acquired by the property owner in the state.
   (h)   The chief appraiser, by written notice delivered to a property owner
who claims an exemption under this section, may require the property owner to
provide copies of property records so the chief appraiser can determine the
amount and value of goods-in-transit and that the location in the state where
the goods-in-transit were detained for storage was not owned by or under the
control of the owner of the goods-in-transit. If the property owner fails to
deliver the information requested in the notice before the 31st day after the
date the notice is delivered to the property owner, the property owner forfeits
the right to claim or receive the exemption for that year.
   (i)   Property that meets the requirements of this section constitutes
goods-in-transit regardless of whether the person who owns the property on
January 1 is the person who transports the property to another location in the
state or outside the state.
   (j)   The governing body of a taxing unit, in the manner required for
official action by the governing body, may provide for the taxation of goods-
in-transit exempt under subsection (b) of this section and not exempt under
other law. The official action to tax the goods-in-transit must be taken before
January 1 of the first tax year in which the governing body proposes to tax
goods-in-transit. Before acting to tax the exempt property, the governing body
of the taxing unit must conduct a public hearing as required by section 1-n(d),
article VIII, of the state constitution. If the governing body of a taxing unit
provides for the taxation of the goods-in-transit as provided by this
subsection, the exemption prescribed by subsection (b) of this section does not
apply to that unit. The goods-in-transit remain subject to taxation by the
taxing unit until the governing body of the taxing unit, in the manner required
for official action, rescinds or repeals its previous action to tax goods-in-
transit, or otherwise determines that the exemption prescribed by subsection
(b) of this section will apply to that taxing unit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding this subsection (j) or official action that was
taken under that subsection before October 1, 2011, to tax goods-in-transit
exempt under subsection (b) of this section and not exempt under other law, a
taxing unit may not tax such goods-in-transit in a tax year that begins on or
after January 1, 2012, unless the governing body of the taxing unit takes
action on or after October 1, 2011, in the manner required for official action
by the governing body, to provide for the taxation of the goods-in-transit. The
official action to tax the goods-in-transit must be taken before January 1 of
the first tax year in which the governing body proposes to tax goods-in-
transit. Before acting to tax the exempt property, the governing body of the
taxing unit must conduct a public hearing as required by section 1-n(d),
article VIII, of the state constitution. If the governing body of a taxing unit
provides for the taxation of the goods-in-transit as provided by this
subsection, the exemption prescribed by subsection (b) of this section does not
apply to that unit. The goods-in-transit remain subject to taxation by the
taxing unit until the governing body of the taxing unit, in the manner required
for official action, rescinds or repeals its previous action to tax goods-in-
transit or otherwise determines that the exemption prescribed by subsection (b)
of this section will apply to that taxing unit.
      (2)   Notwithstanding subsection (j)(1) of this section, if under
subsection (j) of this section, the governing body of a taxing unit, before
October 1, 2011, took action to provide for the taxation of goods-in-transit
and pledged the taxes imposed on the goods-in-transit for the payment of a debt
of the taxing unit, the tax officials of the taxing unit may continue to impose
the taxes against the goods-in-transit until the debt is discharged, if
cessation of the imposition would impair the obligation of the contract by
which the debt was created.

(Ord. No. 839, § 42-177, 9-14-2020)
Sec. 42-178. Tax imposed; amount; registration.
   (a)   Every "owner," save an owner holding an import license and holding
coin-operated machines solely for resale, who exhibits, displays or who permits
to be exhibited or displayed in this state any coin-operated machine shall pay,
and there is hereby levied on each coin-operated machine, except those that are
exempt under section
42-180, an annual fee the maximum percentage of the State of Texas' annual
occupation tax for such devices that a city in Texas may charge, (which at this
time is one-fourth of $60.00 per annum the state charges or $15.00 maximum for
the city in the year 2020). All occupation taxes for coin-operated machines are
payable annually in advance. Upon payment of the tax, every owner shall
register each machine by make, model and serial number with the city tax
assessor and collector or his designated agents. At this time the agent is the
city building official. There is hereby established and levied a late fee on
any such annual fee equal to the amount of the fee itself in addition to the
annual fee due and paid late.
   (b)   Whenever an owner shall exhibit or display, or permit to be exhibited
or displayed, any coin-operated machine for commercial use, there shall be
securely attached thereto a decal issued by the building official evidencing
payment of the tax applicable thereto. Each coin-operated machine is subject to
the occupation tax when exhibited or displayed for commercial use within the
city. Since the tax is payable in advance on an annual calendar year basis, the
following pro rate tax rate schedule will be applicable to a coin-operated
machine which is first exhibited or displayed for commercial use within the
city during any quarter of the calendar year.
      (1)   First quarter—January 1 to March 31: An amount equal to the
applicable annual occupation tax;
      (2)   Second quarter—April 1 to June 30: An amount equal to three-
quarters of the applicable annual occupation tax;
      (3)   Third quarter—July 1 to September 30: An amount equal to one-half
of the applicable annual occupation tax;
      (4)   Fourth quarter—October 1 to December 31: An amount equal to one-
quarter of the applicable annual occupation tax;
In computing any tax payable under the aforesaid pro rata tax rate schedule,
amounts calculated thereunder shall be rounded to the next higher full cent
amount as required.
(Ord. No. 839, § 42-184, 9-14-2020)
Sec. 42-179. Display and issuance of decal evidencing payment; penalties for
noncompliance.
   (a)   The decal issued by the city permit and inspection department to
evidence payment of the tax levied herein shall be securely attached with its
own adhesive to be a fixed, noninterchangeable part of the coin-operated
machine so as to be easily seen by the public and in such a manner that
continued application of stream and water be required to remove the same.
   (b)   During the period commencing on December 15 and ending on December 31
of each year, owners shall pay the occupation tax, register the machines taxed,
and thereby receive a decal for each coin-operated machine to be within the
city as of January 1. At the same time, owners may also pay taxes and receive
decals for unregistered machines, up to ten percent over the number registered.
As a decal is placed on an additional machine the owner shall notify the
building official of taxes of each machine's make, model and serial number,
thereby registering it.
   (c)   If, during each calendar year, an owner desires to secure more decals
than the additional ten percent which may be obtained during the period from
December 15 through December 31, such decals shall be issued upon payment of
the tax applicable to the calendar quarter in which such decals are obtained.
   (d)   It shall be unlawful for an owner to permit to be exhibited or
displayed for commercial use any coin-operated machine which does not have
properly attached thereto a decal evidencing payment of the applicable
occupation tax. The owner of the coin-operated machine on which the tax has not
been paid or which does not have a decal thereon evidencing payment shall
forfeit to the City of Madisonville as a penalty the sum of $200.00. The
penalty, if not paid, shall be recovered by instituting a suit in a court of
competent jurisdiction.

      (4)   Copies of manifests returned to the waste generator shall be
retained for five years and be readily available for review by the POTW.
   (f)   Alternative treatment.
      (1)   A person commits an offense if the person introduces, or causes,
permits, or suffers the introduction of any surfactant, solvent or emulsifier
into a grease trap. Surfactants, solvents, and emulsifiers are materials which
allow the grease to pass from the trap into the collection system, and include,
but are not limited to enzymes, soap, diesel, kerosene, terpene, and other
solvents.
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to an enforcement of section 44-95(f)
(1) that the use of surfactants or soaps is incidental to normal kitchen
hygiene operations.
      (3)   Bioremediation media may be used with the POTW's approval if the
person requesting use of bioremediation media has proved to the satisfaction of
the POTW that laboratory testing, which is appropriate for the type of grease
trap to be used, has verified that:
         a.   The media is a pure live bacterial product which is not
inactivated by the use of domestic or commercial disinfectants and detergents,
strong alkalis, acids, and/or water temperatures of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71
degrees Celsius).
         b.   The use of the media does not reduce the buoyancy of the grease
layer in the grease trap and does not increase the potential for oil and grease
to be discharged to the sanitary sewer.
         c.   The use of the bioremediation media does not cause foaming in the
sanitary sewer.
         d.   The BOD, COD, and TSS discharged to the sanitary sewer after use
of the media does not exceed the BOD, COD, and TSS which would be discharged if
the product were not being used and the grease trap was being properly
maintained. pH levels must be between 5.5 and 9.5.
      (4)   All testing designed to satisfy the criteria set forth in section
44-95(f)(3) shall be scientifically sound and statistically valid in the
opinion of the POTW. All tests to determine oil and grease, TSS, BOD, COD, pH,
and other pollutant levels shall use appropriate tests which have been approved
by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality and which are defined in Title 40, Code of Federal
Regulation, Part 136 or Title 30, Texas Administrative Code § 319.11. Testing
shall be open to inspection by the POTW and shall meet the POTW's approval.

ARTICLE VI. WATER AND SEWER MAINS
Sec. 44-217. Water and sewer main extensions inside the city limits.
The city recognizes that new homes and businesses are often constructed within
the city as the city continues to grow and develop. In the event a citizen,
developer, business person or other individual wishes to extend water and or
sewer mains inside the city, the following policy shall apply:
      (1)   City to pay for first 100 feet. The city shall lay or construct
water or sewer lines to the property line of the property in question and shall
pay for the first 100 feet of water and sewer main extension. The balance of
the cost shall be paid by the individual, business, or corporation requesting
the water or sewer tap and requesting that the utility main be extended.
      (2)   Director of utilities or engineer to calculate cost. The director
of utilities and/or the city engineer shall calculate the overall cost of
extending the water and sewer mains and shall provide the cost estimate to the
individual, business or corporation requesting the water or sewer extension.
      (3)   Director of utilities to determine if utilities are available. The
director of utilities shall also first determine if utilities are available in
the area where water and sewer taps are requested before the city accepts
payment for the water and sewer taps. In the event water and sewer mains are
available, the city shall accept the funds for the water and sewer taps. Water
and sewer taps are then to be scheduled by the director of utilities.
      (4)   If mains are unavailable. In the event water and sewer mains are
not available and the individual, business, or corporation wishes to have the
mains extended, then in that event the individual requesting the water and
sewer tap shall then place the full amount of funds required for the main
extensions in an escrow account with the city before any work shall begin.
      (5)   Payment of additional funds. Once the lines are completed, the
individual, business or corporation requesting the extension shall pay any
difference in funds should the cost exceed the cost estimate prior to the time
any water or sewer tap is made. In no event shall the amount due the city
exceed ten days. The city shall not be required to connect any sewer lines or

citizen, developer, business person or other individual wishes to extend water
and or sewer mains outside the city limits, the following policy shall apply:
      (1)   Payment of 100 percent of all cost. The city shall lay or construct
water or sewer lines to the property line of the property in question; however,

all cost associated with extending the water and sewer mains.

of utilities and/or the city engineer shall calculate the overall cost of
extending the water and sewer mains and shall provide the cost estimate to the
individual, business or corporation requesting the water or sewer extension.
      (3)   Director of utilities to determine if utilities are available. The
director of utilities shall also first determine if utilities are available in
the area where water and sewer taps are requested before the city accepts
payment for the water and sewer taps. In the event water and sewer mains are
available, the city shall accept the funds for the water and sewer taps. Water
and sewer taps are then to be scheduled by the director of utilities.
      (4)   If mains are unavailable. In the event water and sewer mains are
not available and the individual, business, or corporation wishes to have the
mains extended, the individual requesting the water and sewer tap shall then
place the full amount of funds required for the main extension in an escrow
account with the city.
      (5)   Payment of additional funds. Once the lines are completed, the
individual, business, or corporation requesting the extension shall pay any
difference in funds should the cost exceed the cost estimate prior to the time
any water or sewer tap is made. In no event shall the amount due the city
exceed ten days. The city shall not be required to connect any sewer lines or
provide any sewer service until full payment has been received by the city.
      (6)   Reimbursement if required. If the initial deposit is more than the
amount of funds required to lay the line, the city shall reimburse the
individual, business or corporation requesting the extension the full amount of
overpayment. In no event shall the amount due exceed ten days.
      (7)   Engineering and cost. All engineering if required shall be
completed by the city engineer. All construction cost, engineering cost,
surveying, staking, or other related cost shall be included in calculating the
overall cost of the project.
      (8)   Development agreement required. A development agreement shall be
prepared in all instances whereby the city is required to extend water and
sewer mains. All development agreements shall be prepared by the city attorney
and shall be approved by the city council prior to the commencement of any work
involving the extension of water and sewer mains outside the city.

shall be made by the city manager and financial advisor with the final approval
of the city council.

intensity of uses permitted in this district encourage and protect agricultural
uses until urbanization is warranted and the appropriate change in district
classification is made. The Rural/Agricultural District (RA) is also intended
to protect areas that may be unsuitable for development because of physical
problems, lack of infrastructure, space constraints, or potential health or
safety hazards, such as flooding, as well as providing for preservation of
natural open space areas.

      (2)   Exterior access of building. Any self-storage building in the
development with exterior access to the storage facilities shall have a maximum
height of no more than 12 feet.
      (3)   Units for boats and recreational vehicles. Units built solely for
boats and recreational vehicles shall have a maximum height of no more than 16
feet.
      (4)   Interior access of building. Any self-storage building in the
development with interior access to the storage facilities shall have a maximum
height of no more than 30 feet.
      (5)   Development standards for self-storage facilities. It is the intent
of these regulations to preserve the primary frontage on the arterial roadways
in the city and enhance the safety and development impact of self-storage
developments city-wide. Specifically, self-storage uses shall comply with the
requirements as set forth in this section:
         a.   Front setback and street yard. Entry gates shall be located no
less than 50 feet from the right-of-way of a public street. A minimum 25-foot
landscape buffer shall be provided between the front property line and the
first building, including the office/caretaker building, unless the front
buildings are located 300 feet or more from the right-of-way. The landscape
buffer, when required, shall include a minimum of one two-inch caliper canopy
(shade) tree, and five five-gallon shrubs planted for every 40 linear feet of
frontage, rounded to the nearest whole number, with plant types and maintenance
in accordance with subsection (5)d of this section. The landscape buffer area
shall contain a minimum of 50 percent live plant material, and can include an
interior sidewalk.
         b.   Periphery fire lane. A 21-foot fire lane shall be required
between the periphery fence and/or buffer and the storage buildings and storage
parking to provide for emergency access. When the rear or outer wall of a
masonry building is used instead of a periphery fence, the 21-foot fire lane
shall be located at the front of this building.
         c.   Storage parking. Storage or parking of recreational vehicles,
boats, trailers, and other similar outside storage shall not be permitted
within 21 feet of any property line on the periphery of the development. Such
storage shall be screened by a minimum six-foot, but no more than eight-foot-
high masonry fence, or by other storage buildings on-site such that the outside
storage is not directly viewed from any public street. This provision shall not
be interpreted to permit the storage of partially dismantled, wrecked, or
inoperable vehicles.
         d.   Buffering and screening. The entire area that includes the self-
storage use, with exception of the office and its customer and employee
parking, and the access driveways, shall be enclosed by a minimum six-foot high
fence. The outer masonry wall of a building with the landscape buffer may be
used in place of a periphery fence. The fence shall be a privacy fence
constructed of woodcrete, brick, stone, or similar masonry product having a
finished surface, or a fence of wood with masonry columns. The fence
requirement shall allow for wrought iron or black tubular steel only at the
gates. A landscape buffer is required around the periphery of the development.
The outer wall of a building, when used instead of a periphery fence, shall be
constructed of brick, stone or tilt wall. Cinderblocks shall not be permitted
for use as the fence or the outer wall; however, split-faced concrete may be
used. Fencing located adjacent to public streets shall be located behind the
building setback line. An irrigation system shall be installed. The landscape
buffer around the periphery of the development shall be a minimum of ten feet
in width, and shall consist of a minimum area of 50 percent live plant
material. The landscape buffer shall contain at least one two-inch-caliper
canopy tree, and five five-gallon shrubs planted for every 40 linear feet,
rounded to the nearest whole number. The landscape buffer shall be located
outside the fence so that it is visible to the public, except in such case
where the buffer adjoins property bounded predominantly by a privacy fence or
similar barrier that otherwise makes planting and maintenance impractical, in
which case the landscape buffer and plantings may be located inside the fence
and one ornamental tree may be planted for each two shrubs required. Species of
trees and shrubs shall be chosen from water-wise varieties listed in the
preferred plant list, as defined in article XX of this chapter. Maintenance
shall be the responsibility of the property owners. Required maintenance
includes weeding, watering, fertilizing, mowing, mulching and keeping the area
free of litter. Failure to maintain the landscape areas shall constitute a
violation of this chapter. Self-storage buildings that are designed for
interior hallway access only, with no individual exterior access doors to the
individual storage areas, are exempt from the fencing requirements of this
section and shall comply with the landscape regulations in article XX of this
chapter. Dumpsters shall be located within the security fencing and screened
from view of the street or adjacent properties.
         e.   Caretaker residence. A caretaker residence shall be permitted in
connection with the office at the entry to the development. The caretaker
residence shall be a minimum of 800 square feet and shall fully comply with the
building code for a multifamily residential unit.
         f.   Requirements for exterior facades. The exterior facade of the
building containing the office/caretaker residence shall contain a minimum of
50 percent masonry, shall not contain sheet metal siding on the front and side
exterior walls, and shall include a pitched or hipped roof. The exterior of the
self-storage buildings that are screened may be constructed of sheet metal
siding.

Sec. 46-544. Planned development criteria.
The planned development criteria of the Planned Development District (PD) are
as follows:
      (1)   Each proposed development shall be reviewed to determine the
compatibility of the development with surrounding land uses.
      (2)   Open space buffers shall be required to separate land uses within
the planned development from land uses adjacent to the planned development
unless it is determined by the planning and zoning commission that no
incompatibility exists between the land uses.
      (3)   No structure, parking lot, equipment pad, or other manmade
construction not approved by the city shall be placed in an open space buffer.
The size and location of these buffers shall be determined by the planning and
zoning commission upon review of the development plan for the proposed
development.
      (4)   The minimum size of an open space buffer shall be 25 feet measured
from the exterior property line. Landscaping may be required within the buffer
based on the location of existing development, the type of development,
topography, or other criteria established by the planning and zoning
commission.
      (5)   Where structures within the planned development that exceed 35 feet
in height are proposed to be erected on lots adjacent to an ES, SF-1, SF-2, MH,
or RA zoning district, such structures shall be located one foot from the
boundary of the open space buffer for each two feet of height over 35 feet.
      (6)   Planned developments designated as PD-B, PD-I, or PD-M shall have
frontage along and access to a major arterial or major collector street on at
least one side of the proposed development. Primary access through a
residential area to a PD-B, PD-I, or PD-M via a local street is prohibited.
      (7)   The planning and zoning commission or the city council shall not
approve a planned development if it finds that the proposed planned
development:
         a.   Does not conform with applicable regulations and standards
established by this chapter;
         b.   Is not compatible with existing or permitted uses on abutting
sites; in terms of use, building height, bulk and scale, setbacks and open
spaces, landscaping, drainage, or access and circulation features, within the
standards established by this section;
         c.   Potentially creates unfavorable effects or impacts on other
existing or permitted uses on abutting sites that cannot be mitigated by the
provisions of this section;
         d.   Adversely affects the safety and convenience of vehicular and
pedestrian circulation in the vicinity, including traffic reasonably expected
to be generated by the proposed use and other uses reasonably anticipated in
the area considering existing zoning and land uses in the area;
         e.   Fails to reasonably protect persons and property from erosion,
flood or water damage, fire, noise, glare, and similar hazards or impacts;
         f.   Adversely affects traffic control or adjacent properties by
inappropriate location, lighting, or types of signs; or
         g.   Will be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or
materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity, for reasons
specifically articulated by the planning and zoning commission.
      (8)   Unless otherwise specified in the approved development plan, the
minimum requirements for each development shall be those stated in the
subdivision regulations contained in chapter 40 and the requirements of the
most restrictive standard zoning district in which designated uses are
permitted.
      (9)   There are no maximum height restrictions for planned developments
except those noted in this section.
      (10)   The maximum housing density permitted in any planned development
shall be no more than 50 dwelling units per acre.
      (11)   The granting of a PD designation shall not relieve the developer
from responsibility for complying with all other applicable codes and
ordinances of the city unless such relief is specified in the approved
development plan.
      (12)   An owners' association will be required if other satisfactory
arrangements have not been made for providing, operating, and maintaining
common facilities including streets, drives, service and parking areas, common
open spaces, and common recreational areas at the time the development plan is
submitted. If an owners association is required, the articles of incorporation
of an owners' association shall be reviewed by the city to ensure compliance
with the provisions of this chapter.

ARTICLE XX. LANDSCAPING
Sec. 46-611. Purpose.
The tree and landscaping requirements as stated in this article have been
established for the purpose of providing visual buffering and screening to
enhance the appearance of the community and compatibility between adjacent land
uses. They have been designed to ensure that the city is seen as an attractive
place to live and work; to conserve energy and natural resources contributing
to air purification, groundwater recharge; retarding stormwater runoff; and
aiding in noise, glare, and heat abatement. They also help to break the
monotony of urbanized development on the land, contributing to the general
health and welfare of the community.
(Code 2014, § 46-611; Ord. No. 629, § 01.20.001, 12-1-2006)
Sec. 46-612. Application of article.
   (a)   The landscaping requirements of this article shall apply to all land
located in the city and proposed for other than single-family or Downtown
District (DT). Such landscaping requirements shall become applicable as to each
individual lot at such time as an application for a building permit on such lot
is made. All landscaping requirements under this chapter shall run with the
land and their application shall apply to any owner or subsequent owner.
   (b)   Within this article, the term "single-family" means a single detached
dwelling unit not to include duplex, townhouse, or condominium development.
   (c)   Each phase of a phased project shall comply with the requirements of
this article. The portion left for subsequent phases shall remain of
developable size and quality. No certificate of occupancy for the current phase
or no building permit shall be issued for a subsequent phase of a project until
all requirements of this article have been met. In order to issue a certificate
of occupancy on a project in which landscaping improvements are required, the
developer may either install the landscaping to the approval of the city or
submit a letter of credit. In addition to the letter of credit, the owner shall
provide a letter granting the city the right to install the required
landscaping.
   (d)   When the requirements of this article conflict with requirements of
other provisions of this chapter, this article shall prevail; provided,
however, that the provisions of this chapter shall be subordinate to
regulations pertaining to traffic and pedestrian safety.

site) shall be required to be landscaped. In the corridor overlays, an area
equal to 12 percent of the developed area (building site) shall be landscaped.
A lot shall not exceed a total of 90 percent impervious lot coverage. The
developed area shall include the main structure, any accessory structure,
parking lots, equipment lots, and outside storage areas. Landscaping shall be
located to the front and sides of the parcel in those portions of the developed
area facing public rights-of-way. Where screening is required along a public
street, landscaping shall be placed between the screening and the street. The
combination of trees, shrubs, and groundcover shall be used in fulfilling the
landscaping requirements. Where open storage of materials, commodities, or
equipment permitted in the GI and HI Industrial Districts encompass one acre or
more, not including any structures, the area to be landscaped shall be reduced
to five percent of the developed area. Landscaping shall be placed to the
exterior of the screening fence, or be an integral part of the screening fence,
and to the front and sides of the parcel in those portions of the developed
area facing public rights-of way. The combination of trees, shrubs, and
groundcover shall be used in fulfilling the landscaping requirements.
      (2)   Not less than 50 percent of the area to be landscaped shall be
planted in trees.
      (3)   Not less than 50 percent of the trees planted in the area to be
landscaped shall be canopy trees. Canopy trees shall include those species
whose mature crown height is 30 feet or more in height. Noncanopy trees shall
include those species whose mature crown height is at least 15 feet in height.
   (b)   Trees.
      (1)   Trees to be planted shall be six feet or more in height and measure
a minimum of 1½ inches in caliper when measured 12 inches from the base of the
trunk or top of the ball. If smaller caliper trees are desired, 15 square foot
points shall be granted for each. This requirement also applies to all future
building additions.
      (2)   Existing trees used for landscape credit must have a minimum trunk
diameter of 4½ inches or larger and be in a healthy physical state. Should
existing trees used for landscape credit die, they shall be replaced with new
trees according to the requirements of section
46-617(b)(3) of this section. Existing trees with a trunk diameter less than 4½
inches may be given the same landscape credit as that given newly planted trees
with similar characteristics.
      (3)   Square feet of coverage shall be granted in the following amounts
for container trees. If non-container trees are to be used, subtract 50 points.
         a.   Existing canopy trees protected during construction: 225 square
feet.

the number of trees required by subsection (a)(1) of this section. Other
appropriate landscape materials may replace trees in some parking islands.
Substituted trees must be planted elsewhere on-site. Trees to be planted shall
be a minimum of two inches in caliper when measured 12 inches from the base of
the trunk or top of the ball.
      (2)   The remainder of all parking lot islands shall be fully landscaped
with shrubs, grass, live groundcovers, and/or non-vegetative groundcover
approved by the city. When grass is used, 100 percent live grass groundcover
and/or live groundcover is required, whether by solid sod overlay or pre-
planting and successful takeover of grass and/or planting of live groundcover.
Any shrubs used shall constitute partial fulfillment of the requirements of
subsection (a)(1) of this section.
   (f)   Screening. A decorative wall or landscaped earth berm at least two
feet in height or dense shrubbery having year-round foliage at least three feet
in height is required as a visual buffer along street frontages in the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Where outdoor parking areas are located within 30 feet of any
street right-of-way, except for driveway openings providing access from the
street to the parking area;
      (2)   Where fuel pumps are located in any parking area, driveway, or
maneuvering area between the principal building and any street; and

   (g)   Freestanding on-premises signs.
      (1)   Landscaping shall be provided for an area extending a minimum four
linear feet in all directions from the support of all freestanding on-premises
signage. In the event that the signage has more than one support, the
landscaped area shall be extended between the supports at a width of not less
than four feet. This landscaping shall constitute partial fulfillment of the
requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section.
      (2)   The landscaped area shall be composed of a minimum of 50 percent
shrubs. The remainder of the landscaped area shall have 100 percent live grass
groundcover and/or live groundcover whether by solid sod overlay or pre-
planting and successful takeover of grass and/or planting of live groundcover.
   (h)   General use and conformance recommendations of landscaped areas.
      (1)   Trees recommended for use are identified on the tree species list
provided in section
46-618 and may be used to meet these requirements. Other species may be used
upon review and approval of a landscape plan. Native species that conserve
water and have reduced maintenance requirements are suggested for use in
landscaping plans.
      (2)   All required landscaping shall be irrigated by either an
underground sprinkler system, or hose attachment within 150 feet of all
landscaping.
      (3)   All landscaping shall comply with the sight distance requirements
of section

ARTICLE XXI. BUFFER AREA REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 46-640. Purpose.
When it is determined that a zoning district abuts a noncompatible zoning
district along a mutual side or rear property line or where separated only by
an alley, setbacks shall be greater than the minimum requirements set forth.
The purpose of the additional setback is to establish a buffer area to help
mitigate noise, lighting, and other possible adverse impacts. No development
shall be authorized within the buffer area except for required or permitted
landscaping and screening, stormwater detention facilities, and pedestrian
walkways. The increased setbacks, which are measured from the property line,
shall be required on the property in the higher intensity zoning district and
shall be observed at the time of construction. These buffer requirements are in
addition to the screening standards set forth in article XXII of this chapter.
(Code 2014, § 46-640; Ord. No. 629, § 01.21.001, 12-1-2006)
Sec. 46-641. Depth requirements.
   (a)   The depth of the side and rear buffer setbacks shall be in accordance
with the following:
      (1)   100 feet in the General Industrial District (GI) and High
Industrial District (HI) when siding or backing onto General Business District
(GB), Retail District (R), Office District (O), and all residential districts.
      (2)   75 feet in the Commercial District (CD) when siding or backing onto
Office District (O), Retail District (R), and all residential districts.
      (3)   50 feet in the Retail District (R) and General Business District
(GB) when siding or backing onto all residential districts.
      (4)   25 feet in Office District (O) when siding or backing onto all
residential districts.
      (5)   25 feet in Multiple-Family Residential District (MF) when siding or
backing onto all other residential districts of less intensity (ES, SF-1, SF-2,
MH).
      (6)   25 feet in all nonresidential districts when adjacent to a detached
dwelling unit residence located within a Rural Agricultural District (RA) and
no farther than 100 feet from the nonresidential district boundary.
   (b)   The depth of the buffer area may be reduced by the equivalent area of
landscaping provided within the buffer area. No reductions in the setback area
will be allowed where no landscaping is provided parallel to the property
lines. In no event shall the reductions eliminate the standard setbacks
provided in each district. Landscaping used in place of screening, allowed in
section
46-672(a)(4)b, shall not be used to reduce the buffer area. Square feet of
coverage shall be based on the standards provided in all other applicable
sections and/or ordinances. The request for reducing the buffer shall be
submitted with a landscape plan. The minimum depth of the reduced buffer shall
be:
      (1)   60 feet in the General Industrial District (GI) and High Industrial
District (HI) when siding or backing onto General Business District (GB),
Retail District (R), Office District (O), and all residential districts;
      (2)   45 feet in the Commercial District (CS) when siding or backing onto
Office District (O), Retail District (R), and all residential districts;
      (3)   30 feet in the Retail District (R) and General Business District
(GB) when siding or backing onto all residential districts;
      (4)   15 feet in Office District (O) when siding or backing onto all
residential districts; or
      (5)   15 feet in Multiple-Family Residential District (MF) when siding or
backing onto all other residential districts of less intensity (ES, SF-1, SF-2,
MH).

ARTICLE XXII. SCREENING FENCE STANDARDS
Sec. 46-671. Purpose.
Requirements for screening fences is to encourage the most appropriate use of
land and conserve and protect the privacy and value of adjacent permitted uses.
Regulations are prescribed for the location and type of various screening
devices to be used when required in the various zoning districts or in this
section in accordance with the standards in the following section of this
article.
(Code 2014, § 46-671; Ord. No. 629, § 01.22.001, 12-1-2006)
Sec. 46-672. Location and maintenance requirements.
   (a)   Location of required screening.
      (1)   When it is determined that a zoning district sides or backs upon a
noncompatible zoning district, a solid screening wall or fence shall be erected
along the property line, and within the property with the higher intensity
zoning district. The screening requirements shall be observed at the time of
rezoning and/or construction, or upon a change in use of the property where the
screening shall be imposed. The purpose for the screening is to provide a
visual barrier between the properties. The owner of such property shall be
responsible for and shall build the required wall or fence. All wall or fence
openings shall be equipped with gates equal in height and screening
characteristics to the wall or fence. Screening standards shall be in
accordance with the following:
         a.   Screening required in the General Industrial District (GI) and
High Industrial District (HI) when siding or backing onto General Business
District (GB), Retail District (R), Office District (O) and all residential
districts;
         b.   Screening required in the Commercial Services District (CS) when
siding or backing onto Office District (O) and all residential districts;
         c.   Screening required in the General Business District (GB), Retail
District (R) and Office District (O) when siding or backing onto all
residential districts;
         d.   Screening required in the Multiple-Family Residential District
(MF) when siding or backing onto all other residential districts of less
intensity (ES, SF-1, SF-2, MH);
         e.   Screening required in all nonresidential districts when adjacent
to a detached dwelling residence located within an Rural Agricultural District
(RA) and no farther than 100 feet from the nonresidential district boundary;
and
         f.   Screening required in all nonresidential developed tracts of land
within or adjacent to an existing detached dwelling unit residential
development.
      (2)   In any district where loading areas are visible from a public
street, screening shall be provided adjacent to the loading area along the
street, allowing for required landscaping. These standards shall be imposed
except where such use was in existence at the date of the original adoption of
the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
      (3)   Dumpsters, not including containers 300 gallons or smaller, shall
be placed on concrete dumpster pads six inches in thickness, 15 feet in width
and 12 feet in depth. The pad shall be screened with a six-foot fence on three
sides with the fourth side remaining open for access or being fitted with a
gate matching the screening on the other three sides.
      (4)   Where screening is required, the following standards shall be
observed:
         a.   Materials approved for use in screening fences are solid wood
(not including plywood, particleboard, or similar composite), masonry (brick or
stone), or a combination solid wood and masonry. Corrugated metal or fiberglass
panels shall not be used as fence materials. Screening shall be provided that
completely blocks the view of materials, commodities or equipment stored. All
screening materials shall be finished on the sides facing public rights-of-way.
Other types of screening devices may be approved by the planning and zoning
commission;
         b.   Landscaping may be used for screening if the plant materials used
are a minimum of four feet tall at the time they are planted. Any plant
materials used for screening purposes shall be of an evergreen nature and shall
be of sufficient height and type to completely block the view of materials,
commodities or equipment stored from adjacent public rights-of-way or property.
Any time that plant materials are used for screening purposes, the developer
shall post a cash bond to be held in escrow by the city to cover replacement of
plant materials. The amount of such bond shall be determined by the city
manager or his designee. The bond shall be effective for two growing seasons
from the time of the initial planting; any excess funds remaining from such
bond shall be returned at the end of such period to the developer;
         c.   When screening is required to separate a detached dwelling
residential district (ES, SF-1, SF-2, MH) from either the Multiple-Family
Residential District (MF) or a nonresidential district, or when screening is
required to separate nonresidential development from detached dwelling
residential development, any fence or wall shall be not less than six feet or
exceed eight feet in height above the grade of the adjacent property; and
         d.   Along the property line between nonresidential districts, or on
property adjacent to loading areas, open storage and refuse areas, where
screening is required, a minimum six-foot-high uniform screening shall be
provided.
      (5)   In any residential district, the maximum height of any fence or
wall in a required front setback of a detached dwelling unit, townhouse,
duplex, or patio home lot shall be as provided:
         a.   Fencing, screening walls or the combination of berms and fences
or screening walls shall not exceed 36 inches in height when placed a distance
of 25 feet or less from the adjacent paved street surface; and
         b.   Fencing, screening walls or the combination of berms and fences
or screening walls shall not exceed six feet in height when placed a distance
of more than 25 feet or less from the adjacent paved street surface.
      (6)   Where a fence is erected to the rear of the minimum required front
setback line, the fence shall not exceed eight feet in height above the grade
of the adjacent property.
      (7)   A wall or fence, not less than 54 inches in height, with a self-
latching gate at all entrances, shall enclose a swimming pool area or
surrounding yard area.
   (b)   Maintenance of screening fences. Any screening fence erected under the
provisions of this section shall be maintained by replacing or repairing any
dead, loose, damaged, or missing fencing materials within 30 days after
notification by the city manager.

ARTICLE XXIII. CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
Sec. 46-703. Purpose.
The purpose of the conditional use permit process is to identify those uses
which might be appropriate within a zoning district but, due to either their
location, function, or operation, could have a potentially harmful impact on
adjacent properties or the surrounding area; and to provide for a procedure
whereby such uses might be permitted by further restricting or conditioning
them so as to mitigate or eliminate such adverse impacts.
(Code 2014, § 46-703; Ord. No. 629, § 01.23.001, 12-1-2006)
Sec. 46-704. Authority.
The city council may by ordinance approve a conditional use permit for a use in
any district in which such use is authorized under the conditional use list
following proper application. Before taking any such action, the city council
shall submit the same to the planning and zoning commission for its
recommendations and report.
(Code 2014, § 46-704; Ord. No. 629, § 01.23.002, 12-1-2006; Ord. No. 861, § 1,
4-10-2023)
Sec. 46-705. Application and site plan required; Procedure before Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   (a)   No building permit for a use authorized only as a conditional use
within a zoning district shall be issued unless the applicant obtains a
conditional use permit from the city. The application for a conditional use
permit shall be accompanied by a site plan as required in section
46-706. The planning and zoning commission may require additional information
or plans as necessary for review.
   (b)   The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on all
requests for a conditional use permit, and written notice of all such public
hearings shall be sent shall be sent to all owners of real property lying
within 200 feet of the property subject to the conditional use application and
in accordance with the procedures and criteria herein established.
      (1)   Such notice shall be given not less than ten days before the day
set for hearing to all such owners who have rendered their property for city
taxes as the ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll.
      (2)   Such notice may be served by depositing the same, properly

Sec. 46-772. Conditional use permits for WTFs.
Some minor transmission towers and all intermediate and major transmission
towers require a conditional use permit (CUP) from the planning and zoning
commission. The planning and zoning commission may place additional conditions
on the site where it deems necessary to do so to protect the health, safety and
general welfare of the public. The criteria in article XXIII of this chapter
will govern the issuance of conditional use permits for WTFs. In addition to
the standard criteria, the following additional factors shall be considered
when determining whether to grant a conditional use permit for WTFs:
      (1)   Height of the proposed tower, surrounding topography and
surrounding tree coverage and foliage as they relate to:
         a.   Skyline impact, examining whether the proportions of the
structure appear to loom over or blend in with the surrounding environment; and
         b.   Shadow impact, whether or not the proposed tower will cast
shadows that would prevent the reasonable use or enjoyment of surrounding
properties.
      (2)   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness.
      (3)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district/boundaries.
      (4)   Economic impact on adjacent and nearby properties.
      (5)   Proposed ingress and egress.
      (6)   Availability of suitable alternative, existing support structures.

utilities to or to occupy a manufactured home in a new manufactured home land
lease community within the city limits unless the community is duly licensed
under the terms of this article.
   (b)   Licenses shall be issued and renewed annually by the city manager.
Application for a license shall be made in writing, signed by the applicant,
and accompanied by an affidavit of the applicant as to the truth of the
application. Applications shall include the name and address of the applicant,
the location and legal description of the community, and a master plan of the
community. Additionally, a deposit fee, based on the proposed number of lease
lots within the community, will be required at time of application.
   (c)   The chief building official, or his designee, shall renew licenses
annually following a satisfactory inspection of the property for compliance
with this article. Whenever, upon inspection of the property, the chief
building official finds conditions or practices which are in violation of this
article, written notice shall be given to the license holder. The notification
shall state that such conditions or practices must be corrected within a
specified period of time, based on the nature and severity of the violation. At
the end of the specified time, the chief building official shall re-inspect the
property for compliance. Failure to correct the conditions or practices within
the specified time shall result in a suspension of the license. The license
holder will be issued written notice of the suspension. Upon receipt of the
notice of suspension, such person shall cease operation of the manufactured
housing land lease community.
   (d)   A manufactured housing land lease community which does not conform to
the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located shall be deemed a

ARTICLE XXVIII. CLASSIFICATION OF NEW AND UNLISTED USES
Sec. 46-846. Assignment of new uses to zoning districts.
It is recognized that new types of land use may develop and forms of land use
not presently anticipated may seek to locate in the city. These may not be
specified as a permitted use in any zoning district. In order to provide for
such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate
classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made as
follows:
      (1)   The city manager shall refer the question concerning any new or
unlisted use to the planning and zoning commission requesting an interpretation
as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The
referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied by a statement
of facts listing the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling
activity, sales, processing, type of product, storage, anticipated employment,
and transportation regulations likely to be generated and the general
requirement for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer;
      (2)   The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and
described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses

ARTICLE XXXI. PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION
State law reference(s)—Planning and zoning commission, V.T.C.A., Local
Government Code § 211.001 et seq.
Sec. 46-920. Organization.
   (a)   The planning and zoning commission shall be composed of five members,
each of whom shall be appointed by the city council. The city council shall
consider the qualifications of members, including alternate members as
described below, based upon devotion to the best interests of the city and its
citizens. The members shall serve for four-year-staggered terms. An appointee
may be reappointed once, except for in cases of extraordinary circumstances as
determined by the city council, in which case an appointee may be reappointed a
second time. Vacancies occurring within an appointee's term shall be filled by
an appointee from the city council. The members of the planning and zoning
commission shall serve without remuneration for their services as members of
the planning and zoning commission and shall hold no other municipal office.
   (b)   In addition to the five regular members of the commission, two
alternate members of the commission, who shall serve in the absence of one or
more regular members, shall be appointed by a majority vote of the city
council. Alternate members shall be designated in numerical order as first and
second alternates according to length of tenure. If the alternate members have
equal service tenures, then the commission chairperson shall determine which
alternate shall be designated as first or second. The alternate members shall
serve in the absence, vacancy, or disqualification of a regular member in
numerical order. If for any reason, the first alternate member is unavailable
to serve, the second alternate member shall so serve. Alternate members may
participate in discussions on items before the commission, but shall have no
right to make motions or vote except when acting in the absence, vacancy, or
disqualification of a regular member. The alternates shall serve for four-year-
staggered terms and may be reappointed at the discretion of the city council.
Vacancies occurring within an alternate's term shall be filled by an appointee
from the city council. Service as an alternate commissioner does not count
toward the term limitations provided in subsection (a).
   (c)   The planning and zoning commission shall select from its membership a
chairperson and vice-chairperson and such other officers as it may deem
necessary. Such election shall be for a period of one year. It shall adopt
rules for the practical and efficient transaction of business and shall keep a
record of its resolutions, transactions, findings, and determinations, which
record shall be a public record. At least one meeting per month shall be held,
so long as there is a need, and additional meetings may be held from time-to-
time, upon the call of the chair. An alternate commission member may not serve
as a chairperson or vice-chairperson.
   (d)   Commission members and alternates shall attend all meetings of the
commission. Three consecutive absences, or a total of five absences during a
12-month period shall cause the city council to consider removal of the
commission member or alternate. Failure to meet these attendance requirements
will also bar the member or alternate from being reappointed for a subsequent
term, absent the showing of good cause presented to, and accepted by the city
council based on special circumstances.
   (e)   Members and alternates of the commission may be removed by the city
council for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.

Sec. 46-922. Variances.
   (a)   Planning and zoning commission authorization. The planning and zoning
commission may authorize a variance from the regulations in this article when,
in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In
granting a variance, the planning and zoning commission shall prescribe only
conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable in the public interest. In
making the findings hereinbelow required, the planning and zoning commission
shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved,
existing uses of land in the vicinity, and expected type and volume of traffic.
   (b)   Conditions for granting. No variance shall be granted unless the
planning and zoning commission finds that all of the following are met:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this
article would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the applicant's
land;
      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of substantial property rights of the applicant;
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare or injurious to other property or public
facilities in the area; and
      (4)   That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of
preventing the orderly development of the applicant's land and/or land in the
vicinity in accordance with the provisions of this article.
   (c)   Findings of planning and zoning commission. Such findings of the
planning and zoning commission, together with the specific facts upon which
findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the
planning and zoning commission meeting at which such variance is granted.
Variances only may be granted when in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this article so that the public health, safety and welfare may be
secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardship to the developer,
standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship.
   (d)   Requests to be in writing. All requested variances from this article
shall be made in writing at least ten working days prior to the date on which
consideration is to be given by the planning and zoning commission. Submittal
shall be made at city hall.

filing of a notice of appeal, the city council shall, within 30 days, conduct a
review of the decision of the planning and zoning commission denying the
requested variance. In its review of the decision of the planning and zoning
commission to deny the requested variance, the city council shall utilize the
criteria set forth in section
46-922.
   (b)   Failure of city council to act. An application for a variance is
automatically granted if the city council does not act on the variance appeal

of this article, if it makes written findings that:
      (1)   The requirement does not allow for a reasonable use of the
property;

generally characteristic of other parcels of land in the area; and
      (4)   Development under the variance does not:

         b.   Impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in
compliance with the city requirements; or

shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement or diminution
of the measured noise. A windscreen for the microphone shall be used when
required. Traffic and transportation noise sources and other background noises
shall not be considered in taking measurements except where such background
noise interferes with the primary noise being measured. Times when the level of
the primary noise being measured does not exceed that of the background noise
in all octave bands shall be considered as off times of the primary noise.
   (b)   At no point at the bounding property line of any use in the GI or HI
district shall the sound pressure level of any operation or plant exceed the
following decibel limits:
      (1)   Weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.: 75 decibels (db).
      (2)   Weekdays from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and through the weekend: 65
decibels (db).

(Ord. No. 620, § 1, 12-14-2004; Ord. No. 652, § 4, 5-12-2008)
Section 2. Construction, maintenance, operation & relocation of company
facilities.
   (a)   Company shall lay, maintain, construct, operate, and replace its
pipes, mains, laterals, and other equipment to minimize interference with
traffic, place or cause to be placed appropriate barriers to mark excavations
or obstructions, and restore to approximate original condition all Public
Rights-of-Way that it may disturb. In determining the location of the
facilities of the City and other users of Public Right-of-Way within City, City
shall minimize interference with then existing facilities of Company and shall
require other users of Public Rights-of-Way to minimize interference with
existing facilities of Company. In the event of a conflict between the location
of the proposed facilities of Company and the location of the existing
facilities of City or other users of Public Rights-of-Way within Public Rights-
of-Way that cannot otherwise be resolved, City or an authorized agent of City
shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective
facilities within the Public Rights-of-Way. Company shall not be required to
obtain street cutting, street excavation or other special permits related to
excavations in Public Rights-of-Way in connection with Company's operations in
Public Rights-of-Way.
   (b)   When the Company is required by City to remove or relocate its mains,
laterals, and other facilities to accommodate construction of streets and
alleys by City, and Company is eligible under federal, state, county, local or
other programs for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by Company as a
result of such removal or relocation, and such reimbursement is required to be
handled through City, Company costs and expenses shall be included in any
application by City for reimbursement, if Company submits its cost and expense
documentation to City prior to the filing of the application. City shall
provide reasonable notice to Company of the deadline for Company to submit
documentation of the costs and expenses of such relocation to City. If the
Company is required by City to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, or other
facilities for any reason other than the construction of streets and alleys by
City, Company shall be entitled to reimbursement from City or others of the
cost and expense of such removal or relocation. When Company is required to
remove or relocate its mains, laterals or other facilities to accommodate
construction by City without reimbursement from City, Company shall have the
right to seek recovery of relocation costs as provided for in applicable state
and/or federal law.
   (c)   If City abandons any Public Right-of-Way in which Company has
facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Company's right to
maintain its use of the former Public Right-of-Way and on the obligation of the
party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Company for all
removal or relocation expenses if Company agrees to the removal or relocation
of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Right-of-Way. If the
party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned requests the Company to
remove or relocate its facilities and Company agrees to such removal or
relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time
at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation
cannot practically be made to another Public Right-of-Way, the expense of any
right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be
reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation.

extent such injury or damage is attributable to the fault of the City,
including, without limitation, the City's negligent or intentional acts or
omissions. Company's insurance of its obligations and risks undertaken pursuant

Rider:          WNA—Weather Normalization Adjustment
Applicable to:  All customers in the Mid-Tex Division except the city of Dallas
                and unincorporated areas
Effective date: Bills Rendered on or after 11/01/2013
 
[(kk)]   Provisions for Adjustment. The Commodity Charge per Ccf (100 cubic
feet) for gas service set forth in any Rate Schedules utilized by the cities of
the Mid-Tex Division service area for determining normalized winter period
revenues shall be adjusted by an amount hereinafter described, which amount is
referred to as the "Weather Normalization Adjustment." The Weather
Normalization Adjustment shall apply to all temperature sensitive residential
and commercial bills based on meters read during the revenue months of November
through April. The five regional weather stations are Abilene, Austin, Dallas,
Waco, and Wichita Falls.
[(ll)]   Computation of Weather Normalization Adjustment. The Weather
Normalization Adjustment Factor shall be computed to the nearest one-hundredth
cent per Ccf by the following formula:
 
WNAF j = R j (HSFj× (NDD - ADD))
             (BL j + (HSF j × ADD))
 
Where:
j =Any particular Rate Schedule or billing classification within any such
particular Rate Schedule that contains more than one billing classification.
WNAF j =Weather Normalization Adjustment Factor for the jth rate schedule or
classification expressed in cents per Ccf.
R j =Commodity Charge rate of temperature sensitive sales for the jth. schedule
or classification.
HSF j =Heat sensitive factor for the jth schedule or classification divided by
the average bill count in that class.
NDD=Billing cycle normal heating degree days calculated as the simple ten-year
average of actual heating degree days.
ADD=Billing cycle actual heating degree days.
BI j =Base load sales for the jth schedule or classification divided by the
average bill count in that class.
The Weather Normalization Adjustment for the jth customer in ith rate schedule
is computed as:
 
WNA ij = WNAF i × q ij
 
Where:
q ij is the relevant sales quantity for the jth customer in ith rate schedule.

[(mm)]   Weather Normalization Adjustment (WNA) Report. On or before June 1 of
each year, the company posts on its website at atmosenergy.com/mtx-wna, in
Excel format, a Weather Normalization Adjustment (WNA) Report to show how the
company calculated its WNAs factor during the preceding winter season.
Additionally, on or before June 1 of each year, the company files one hard copy
and a Excel version of the WNA Report with the Railroad Commission of Texas'
Gas Services Division, addressed to the Director of that Division.
[(nn)]   Model Staff Report. The City, along with approximately 164 other
cities served by Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division ("Atmos Mid-Tex" or "Company"),
is a member of the Atmos Cities Steering Committee ("ACSC"). On or about July
15, 2013, Atmos Mid-Tex filed with the City an application to increase natural
gas rates pursuant to the Rate Review Mechanism ("RRM") tariff renewed by the
City in 2013 as a continuation and refinement of the previous RRM rate review
process. This is the first annual RRM filing under the renewed RRM tariff.
[(oo)]   The Atmos Mid-Tex RRM filing sought a $22.7 million rate increase
system-wide based on an alleged test-year cost of service revenue deficiency of
$25.7 million. The City worked with ACSC to analyze the schedules and evidence
offered by Atmos Mid-Tex to support its request to increase rates. The
Ordinance and attached rate tariffs are the result of negotiations between ACSC
and the Company to resolve issues raised by ACSC during the review and
evaluation of Atmos Mid-Tex's RRM filing.
[(pp)]   The Ordinance resolves the Company's RRM filing by authorizing
additional revenues to the Company of $16.6 million system-wide. For purposes
of comparison, this negotiated result is about $11 million less than what
ACSC's consultants calculated that Atmos would have been entitled to if Atmos
had filed a case under the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program ("GRIP")
rather than an RRM case. The settlement is expected to increase the average
residential customer's bill by approximately $0.74 per month. An Average Bill
Comparison of base rates has been prepared for residential, commercial,
industrial, and transportation customers.
[(qq)]   The ACSC Executive Committee and ACSC legal counsel recommend that all
ACSC Cities adopt the Ordinance implementing the rate change.
[(rr)]   RRM Background. The RRM tariff was originally approved by ACSC Cities
as part of the settlement agreement to resolve the Atmos Mid-Tex 2007 system-
wide rate filing at the Railroad Commission. In early 2013, the City adopted a
renewed RRM tariff for an additional five years. Atmos Mid-Tex's July 2013
filing was made pursuant to the renewed RRM tariff.
[(ss)]   The RRM tariff and the process implementing that tariff were created
collaboratively by ACSC and Atmos Mid-Tex as an alternative to the
legislatively-authorized GRIP surcharge process. ACSC has opposed GRIP because
it constitutes piecemeal ratemaking, does not allow any review of the
reasonableness of Atmos' expenditures, and does not allow participation by
cities or recovery of cities' rate case expenses. In contrast, the RRM process
has allowed for a more comprehensive rate review and annual adjustment as a
substitute for GRIP filings. ACSC's consultants have calculated that had Atmos
filed under the GRIP provisions, it would have received additional revenues
from ratepayers in excess of $28 million.
[(tt)]   Purpose of the Ordinance. Rates cannot change without the adoption of
rate ordinances by cities. No related matter is pending at the Railroad
Commission. The purpose of the Ordinance is to approve rates (shown on
"Attachment A" to the Ordinance) that reflect the negotiated rate changes
pursuant to the RRM process and to ratify the recommendation of the ACSC
Executive Committee. Please make sure that the tariffs are attached when the
Ordinance is passed by the City Council.
[(uu)]   As a result of the negotiations, ACSC was able to reduce the Company's
requested $22.7 million RRM increase to $16.6 million. Approval of the
Ordinance will result in the implementation of new rates that increase Atmos
Mid-Tex's revenues effective November 1, 2013.
[(vv)]   Reasons Justifying Approval of the Negotiated Resolution. Consultants
working on behalf of ACSC Cities have investigated the support for the
Company's requested rate increase. While the evidence does not support the
$22.7 million increase requested by the Company, ACSC's consultants agree that
the Company can justify an increase in revenues of some lesser amount. The
agreement on $16.6 million is a compromise between the positions of the
parties.
[(ww)]   The alternative to a resolution of the RRM filing would be a GRIP
filing by the Company, based upon the Railroad Commission's decision in the
2012 rate case. A GRIP filing would entitle the Company to receive more than
$28 million in additional revenues, with ACSC being precluded from reviewing
the reasonableness of the GRIP filing. The ACSC Executive Committee recommends
that ACSC members take action to approve the Ordinance authorizing new rate
tariffs.
[(xx)]   No Changes to Residential Customer Charges. For the first annual
filing under the revised RRM tariff, the Company agreed to forgo any change to
the residential customer charge. Therefore, for the 2013 RRM, the result of the
filing will not increase the residential customer charge, and the entirety of
the increase to the residential class will be applied to the commodity (natural
gas consumption) component of rates.
[(yy)]   Explanation of "Be It Ordained" Paragraphs:
            1.   This paragraph approves all findings in the Ordinance.
            2.   This section adopts the attached tariffs ("Attachment A") in
all respects and finds the rates set pursuant to the attached tariffs to be
just, reasonable and in the public interest. Note that only new tariffs or
existing tariffs being revised are attached to the Ordinance. Existing tariffs
not being changed in any way are not attached to the Ordinance.
            3.   This section requires the Company to reimburse ACSC for
reasonable ratemaking costs associated with reviewing and processing the RRM
application.
            4.   This section repeals any resolution or ordinance that is
inconsistent with this Ordinance.
            5.   This section finds that the meeting was conducted in
compliance with the Texas Open Meetings Act, Texas Government Code Chapter 551.
            6.   This section is a savings clause, which provides that if any
section(s) is later found to be unconstitutional or invalid, that finding shall
not affect, impair or invalidate the remaining provisions of this Ordinance.
This section further directs that the remaining provisions of the Ordinance are
to be interpreted as if the offending section or clause never existed.
            7.   This section is a "most favored nations" clause. It provides
that if the Company settles with other parties on better terms than agreed to
with the ACSC Cities, the ACSC Cities (including the City) will automatically
receive the benefit of those better terms.
            8.   This section provides for an effective date upon passage.
            9.   This paragraph directs that a copy of the signed Ordinance be
sent to a representative of the Company and legal counsel for ACSC.

(Ord. No. 334, art. I, § 12, 12-11-1995)
Section 13. Rights of individuals.

with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and
all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination which are
hereby incorporated and made part of this ordinance by reference.

subscriber. The request for such permission shall be contained in a separate
document with a prominent statement that the subscriber is authorizing the
permission in full knowledge of its provision. Such written permission shall be
for a limited period of time not to exceed one year, which shall be renewable
at the option of the subscriber. No penalty shall be invoked for a subscriber's
failure to provide or renew such an authorization. The authorization shall be
revocable at any time by the subscriber without penalty of any kind whatsoever
provided that such revocation request may be required to be in writing by
Grantee. Such authorization is required for each type or classification of
Class IV cable activity planned; provided, however, that the Grantee shall be
entitled to conduct system-wide or individually addressed "sweeps" for the
purpose of verifying system integrity, controlling return-path transmission, or
billing for services.
   D.   The Grantee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not, without the
specific written authorization of the subscriber involved, sell, or otherwise
make available to any party;
      (1)   Lists of the names and addresses of such individual subscribers; or
      (2)   Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual
subscribers.

agencies or other entities having a legitimate use for the network; and no one
shall be arbitrarily excluded from its use; allocation of use of said
facilities shall be made according to the rules or decisions of the Grantee and
any regulatory agencies affecting the same.
   F.   Grantee shall establish rates that are nondiscriminatory within the
same general class of subscribers which must be applied fairly and uniformly to
all subscribers in the franchise area for all services. Nothing contained
herein shall prohibit the Grantee from offering:
      (i)   Discounts to commercial and multiple family dwelling subscribers
billed on a bulk basis;
      (ii)   Promotional discounts; or
      (iii)   Reduced installation rates for subscribers who have multiple

remaining portions of this Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 334, art. I, § 15, 12-11-1995)
ARTICLE II. CS EXTENSION, OPERATION, STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES
Section 1. Service availability.
The Grantee shall provide cable service throughout the entire Franchise area
pursuant to the provisions of this Franchise and shall keep a record of all
service extended by the Grantee. This record shall be available for inspection
by the City at the local office of the Grantee during regular office hours.
   A.   Line Extensions.
       (1)   In all areas of the Franchise territory, the Grantee shall be
required to extend its system pursuant to the following requirements:
         (a)   Grantee must extend and make CS service available to every
dwelling unit in all unserved, developing areas having at least 40 dwelling
units per cable mile as measured from the existing system, and shall extend its
system simultaneously with the installation of utility lines.
         (b)   Grantee must extend and make CS service available to any
isolated resident requesting connection at the standard connection charge, if
the connection to the isolated resident would require no more than a standard
150 foot aerial drop line.
      (2)   Early Extension. In areas not meeting the requirement for mandatory
extension of service, Grantee shall provide, upon the written request of a
potential subscriber desiring service, an estimate of the costs required to
extend service to said subscriber. Grantee may require advance payment or
assurance of payment satisfactory to Grantee. The amount paid by subscribers
for early extension shall be nonrefundable, and in the event the area
subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such
payments shall be treated as consideration for early extension.
      (3)   New Development Underground. In cases of new construction or
property development where utilities are to be placed underground, the
developer or property owner shall give Grantee reasonable notice of such
construction or development, and of the particular date on which open trenching
will be available for Grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals and/or
vaults, and laterals to be provided at Grantee's expense. Grantee shall also
provide specifications as needed for trenching.
      (4)   Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the
development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if
Grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals
within five working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated
in the notice given by the developer or property owner, then should the
trenches be closed after the five-day period, the cost of new trenching is to
be borne by Grantee. Except for the notice of the particular date on which
trenching will be available to Grantee, any notice provided to Grantee by City
of a preliminary plat request shall satisfy the requirement of reasonable
notice if sent to the local general manager or system engineer of Grantee prior
to approval of the preliminary plat request.
   B.   Special Agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent
Grantee from serving areas not covered under this section upon agreement with
developers, property owners, or residents.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 1, 12-11-1995)
Section 2. Construction and technical standards.
   A.   Construction Standard.
      (1)   Compliance with Safety Codes. All construction practices shall be
in accordance with all applicable sections of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970 and any amendments thereto as well as all state and local
codes where applicable.
      (2)   Compliance with Electrical Codes. All installation of electronic
equipment shall be of a permanent nature, durable and installed in accordance
with the provisions of the National Electric Safety Code as amended.
      (3)   Antennas and Towers. Antenna supporting structures (towers) shall
be designed for the proper loading zone as specified in Electronics Industry
Association's R.S.-22A Specifications.
      (4)   Compliance with Aviation Requirements. Antenna supporting
structures (tower) shall be painted, lighted, erected and maintained in
accordance with all applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration and all other applicable state or local codes and regulations.
      (5)   Construction Standards and Requirements. All of the Grantee's plant
and equipment, including, but not limited to, the antenna site, head-end and
distribution system, towers, house connections, structures, poles, wire, cable,
coaxial cable, fixtures and appurtenances shall be installed, located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained and
operated in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by
experienced maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger or
interfere with improvements the municipality may deem proper to make, or to
interfere in any manner with the rights of any property owner, or to
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic on municipal
properties.
      (6)   Safety, Nuisance, Requirements. The Grantee shall at all times
employ ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted
methods and devices preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause
damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
   B.   Network Technical Requirements. The Cable System shall be operated so
as to meet the following general objectives:
      (1)   Capable of continuous 24 hour daily operation;
      (2)   Capable of operating over an outdoor temperature range of -20
degrees Fahrenheit to plus 120 degrees Fahrenheit and meeting all
specifications as set forth herein over said temperature range without
catastrophic failure or irreversible performance changes over variations in
supply voltages from 105 to 130 volts AC;
      (3)   Operated in such a manner as to avoid causing interference with
reception of off-the-air signals by non-subscribers to the network;
      (4)   Designed, installed and operated so as to assure the delivery to
all subscribers of standard color and monochrome signals on the FCC-designed
Class I channels without noticeable picture degradation or visible evidence of
color distortion or other forms of interference directly attributable to the
performance of the Cable System.
   C.   Performance Monitoring.
      (1)   Test procedures used in verification of the performance criteria
set forth herein, if not as set forth in paragraph 76.609, Subpart K of the FCC
Rules and Regulations, shall be in accordance with good engineering practice
and shall be fully described in an attachment to the annual certificate filed
upon request with the City.
      (2)   To the extent that the report of measurements as required above may
be combined with any reports of measurements required by the FCC or other
regulatory agencies, the City shall accept such combined reports, provided that
all standards and measurements herein or hereafter established by the City are
satisfied.
      (3)   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers the City
may require additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, different test
procedures, or test involving a specific subscriber's terminal. Requests for
such additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints received or other
evidence indicating an unresolved controversy or significant non-compliance,
and such tests will be limited to the particular matter in controversy. The
City will endeavor to so arrange its requests for such special tests so as to
minimize hardship or inconvenience to Grantee or to the subscriber.
   D.   Street Occupancy.
      (1)   Grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities
whenever possible, and shall not construct or install any new, different, or
additional poles, conduits, or other facilities whether on public property or
on privately owned property until the written approval of the City is obtained,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, no location of any
pole or wire holding structure of the Grantee shall be a vested interest and
such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the Grantee at its own
expense whenever the City reasonably determines that the public convenience
would be enhanced thereby.
      (2)   The facilities of the Grantee shall be installed underground in
those areas of the City where existing telephone and electric services are both
underground at the time of system construction. In areas where either telephone
or electric utility facilities are installed aerially at the time of system
construction, the Grantee may install its facilities aerially with the
understanding that at such time as the existing aerial facilities are required
to be placed underground by the City, the Grantee shall likewise place its
facilities underground.
      (3)   A Grantee shall notify the City at least ten days prior to the
intention of the Grantee to commence any construction in any streets. The City
shall cooperate with the Grantee in granting any permits required, providing
such grant and subsequent construction by the Grantee shall not unduly
interfere with the use of such streets and that proposed construction shall be
done in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the ordinances of the City.
      (4)   All transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be so
installed and located as to cause minimum interference with the rights and
reasonable convenience of property owners and, at all times, shall be kept and
maintained in a safe, adequate and substantial condition, and in good order and
repair. The Grantee shall, at all times, employ ordinary care and shall install
and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing
failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries, or nuisances
to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices
shall be used at such times and places as are reasonably required for the
safety of all members of the public. Any poles or other fixtures placed in any
public way [by] the Grantee shall be placed in such a manner as not to
interfere with the usual travel on such public way.
      (5)   Grantee shall, at its own expense, and in a manner approved by the
City, restore to City standards and specifications any damage or disturbance
caused to the public way as a result of its operations or construction on its
behalf.
      (6)   Whenever, in case of fire or other disaster, it becomes necessary
in the judgment of the Chief of the Fire Department or Chief of the Police
Department to remove any of the Grantee's facilities, no charge shall be made
by the Grantee against the City for restoration and repair, unless such acts
amount to gross negligence by the City.
      (7)   Grantee or its designee shall have the authority to trim trees on
public property at its own expense as may be necessary to protect its wires and
facilities, subject to the supervision and direction of the City. Trimming of
trees on private property shall require written consent of the property owner.
      (8)   The Grantee at its expense shall protect, support, temporarily
disconnect, relocate, or remove any property of Grantee when, in the opinion of
the City, the same is required by reason of traffic conditions, public safety,
street vacation, freeway or street construction, change or establishment of
street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power line, signal
line, transportation facilities, tracks, or any other types of structure or
improvements by governmental agencies whether acting in a governmental or a
proprietary capacity, or any other structure or public improvement, including,
but not limited to, movement of buildings, urban renewal and redevelopment, and
any general program under which the City shall undertake to cause all such
properties to be located beneath the surface of the ground. The Grantee shall
in all cases have the privilege, subject to the corresponding obligations, to
abandon any property of Grantee in place. Nothing hereunder shall be deemed a
taking of the property of Grantee and Grantee shall be entitled to no surcharge
by reason of anything hereunder.
      (9)   Upon failure of Grantee to commence, pursue or complete any work
required by law or by the provisions of this Ordinance to be done in any
street, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of the
City, the City may, at its option, cause such work to be done and the Grantee
shall pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the
City to Grantee within 30 days after receipt of such itemized report.
      (10)   The Grantee shall make no paving cuts or curb cuts unless
absolutely necessary, but only after written permission has been given by the
City.
      (11)   The Grantee shall install in conduit all cable passing under any
major roadway.

Section 3. Service and rates.
   A.   Office and Phone. The Grantee shall maintain a local office which shall
be open during all usual business hours, have a locally listed telephone and be
so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments may be
received at any time. In addition, the Grantee shall maintain a service during
normal business hours, for the receipt of sums due by its subscribers and shall
provide for regular billing of accounts.
   B.   Notification of Service Procedures. The Grantee shall furnish each
subscriber at the time service is installed, written instructions that clearly
set forth procedures and furnish information concerning the procedures for
making inquiries or complaints, including the Grantee's name, address and local
telephone number. Grantee shall give the City 30 day's prior notice of any rate
increases, channel lineup or other substantive service changes.
   C.   Rate Revision. To the extent that Federal or State law or regulation
may now, or as the same may hereafter be amended to, authorize the City to
regulate the rates for any particular service tiers, service packages,
equipment, or any other services provided by Grantee, the City shall have the
right to exercise rate regulation to the full extent authorized by law, or to
refrain from exercising such regulation for any period of time, at the sole
discretion of the City. If and when exercising rate regulation, the City shall
abide by the terms and conditions set forth by the FCC.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 3, 12-11-1995)
Section 4. Continuity of service.
   A.   It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service
insofar as their financial and other obligations to the Grantee are honored. In
the event that the Grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, or sell the
system, or the City gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this
Franchise, the Grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive
continuous, uninterrupted service unless circumstances are beyond the control
of the Grantee, unforeseen circumstances, or acts of God. In the event of a
change of Grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the
Grantee shall cooperate with the City, new Grantee or operator in maintaining
continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, Grantee shall be
entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system.
   B.   In the event Grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive
days without prior approval of the City or without just cause, the City may, at
its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as
Grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the City or a permanent
operator is selected. If the City is required to fulfill this obligation for
the Grantee, the Grantee shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs or
damages in excess of revenues from the system received by the City that are the
result of the Grantee's failure to perform.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 4, 12-11-1995)
Section 5. Grantee rules and regulations.
The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable the Grantee to exercise its rights and perform
its obligations under this Franchise, and to assure an uninterrupted service to
each and all of its customers. Provided, however, that such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or
applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 5, 12-11-1995)
Section 6. Franchise fee.
Grantee shall pay to the City an annual fee in an amount equal to five percent
(5%) of the annual gross receipts. Such payment shall be in addition to any
other payment, charge, permit fee or bond owed to the City by the Grantee and
shall not be construed as payment in lieu of personal or real property taxes
levied by state, county or local authorities.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 6, 12-11-1995)
Section 7. Payment to city.
   A.   Method of Computation. Sales taxes or any other taxes or fees including
copyright fees which are collected from subscribers by the Grantee to be
remitted by the Grantee to a governmental agency shall be deducted from the
gross subscriber receipts prior to the computation of the annual Franchise fee.
The fee due the City under the provisions of section 6 above shall be computed
and paid quarterly, based on the Grantee's fiscal year, with the last quarter
payment being adjusted based on review of the Grantee's gross receipts and
shall be paid not later than 90 days after the end of the Grantee's fiscal year
at the office of the Treasurer during its regular business hours. The payment
period shall commence as of the effective date of the Franchise. In the event
of a dispute, the City, if it so requests, shall be furnished a statement of
said payment, by a Certified Public Accountant, reflecting the gross receipts
and the above charges, deductions and computations for the period covered by
the payment.
   B.   Acceptance by City. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be
construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City
may have for further or additional sums payable as a Franchise fee under this
Ordinance or for the performance of any other obligation of the Grantee.
   C.   Failure to Make Required Payment. In the event that any Franchise
payment or recomputed payment is not made on or before the dates specified
herein, Grantee shall pay as additional compensation:
      (1)   An interest charged, computed from such due date, at the annual
rate of nine percent per annum; and
      (2)   A sum of money equal to two percent of the amount due in order to
defray those additional expenses and costs incurred by the City by reason of
delinquent payment.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 7, 12-11-1995)
Section 8. Transfer of ownership or control.
   A.   The Franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held for the
benefit of the public. Said Franchise cannot in any event be sold, transferred,
leased, assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by forced or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or other means without the
prior consent of the City, and then only under such conditions as the City may
establish. Such consent as required by the City shall, however, not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.
   B.   The Grantee shall promptly notify the City of any actual or proposed
change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the
Grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders
but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable
presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the
acquisition by any person or group of persons of ten percent (10%) of the
voting shares of the Grantee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control
of the Grantee shall make the Franchise subject to cancellation unless and
until the City shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the City may inquire into
the qualification of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall
assist the City in any such inquiry.
   C.   By its acceptance of this Franchise, the Grantee specifically grants
and agrees that any such sale, assignment or transfer occurring without prior
approval of the City Board shall constitute a violation of this Franchise by
the Grantee.
   D.   The foregoing requirements shall not apply to any sale, assignment or
transfer to any Person which is owned or controlled by the Grantee, or any
Person which owns or controls the Grantee. Grantee shall notify the City 30
days prior to any sale, assignment or transfer.

      (2)   A full and complete set of plans, records and "as-built" maps
showing the exact location of all CS equipment installed or in use in the City,
exclusive of subscriber service drops.
   C.   Filing. When not otherwise prescribed herein, all matters required to
be filed with the City shall be filed with the City Clerk.
   D.   Other Records. The City may impose reasonable requests for additional
information, records and documents from time to time.
   E.   Inspection of Property and Records. At all reasonable times, Grantee
shall permit examination by any duly authorized representative of the City of
all Franchise property, together with any appurtenant property of Grantee
situated within or without the City. Grantee shall also permit any duly
authorized representative of the City to examine and transcribe any and all
maps and other records kept or maintained by Grantee or under its control
concerning the operations or property of Grantee.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 9, 12-11-1995)
Section 10. Removal of CS.
At the expiration of the term for which this Franchise is granted, or upon its
termination as provided herein, Grantee shall forthwith, upon notice by City,
remove at its own expense the CS from all streets and public property within
the City. If Grantee fails to do so, City may perform the work at Grantee's
expense.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 10, 12-11-1995)
Section 11. Required services and facilities.
The Grantee agrees that the equipment used in fulfillment of its franchise
obligation shall be maintained at the highest standards consistent with changes
in the state of the art and Grantee shall regularly advise the City of its
equipment changes and modifications to upgrade the system.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 11, 12-11-1995)
Section 12. Areawide interconnection of cable systems.
The Grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional
interconnection authority or City, county, state and federal regulatory agency
which may be hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing, or
otherwise providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the
boundaries of the City.
(Ord. No. 334, art. II, § 12, 12-11-1995)
Section 13. Community programming.
   (a)   The Grantee shall maintain, without charge, one outlet to each public
school, located in the area served by the system, and will provide free basic
service, for so long as the system remains in operation in the area. Any such
school may install, as its expense, such additional outlets for classroom
purposes at it desires, provided that such installation shall not interfere
with the operation of Grantee's system, and that the quality and manner of
installation of such additional connections shall have been approved by the
Grantee and shall comply with all City, state and federal laws and regulations.
   (b)   In addition, the Grantee shall furnish to the City, without charge,
that is, without installation or monthly charges, one outlet to each Police and
Fire Station, and to the City hall.
   (c)   In addition to the local Public, Education and Government (PEG) access
channels available to subscribers on the effective date of this Ordinance, the
Grantee shall also maintain a minimum of one equipped production studio for the
service area, technical assistance, maintenance for the equipment, and a staff

determine, in its discretion, whether or not any default, failure, refusal or
neglect by the Grantee was with just cause.

with just cause, the Board shall direct the Grantee to comply within such time
and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.

attachments. The City shall inspect and approve the condition of the public
ways and public places; and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal.
