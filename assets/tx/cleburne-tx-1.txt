any place of business fail or refuse to pay the charges for garbage pickup
fixed against him or his place of business when due the city, the City Water
Department shall be authorized to cut off and terminate the water and sewer
services to his place of abode or place of business. In addition thereto, the
city shall be authorized to discontinue garbage pickup services until any
outstanding pickup fees have been paid in full.
   (B)   In the event that the city does not provide water and sewer service to
property owners within the city limits but the city does provide garbage pickup
service to such property owners, and in those cases in which a number of
buildings or structures within the city limits are leased by one common owner
or landlord to several different tenants or lessees, and the landlord pays
water and sewer service fees for each individual structure or leased premises
owned by such landowner, then in such cases each tenant, lessee, occupant or
property owner responsible for payment of garbage pickup fees will be required
to put up a deposit equal to one month's garbage service fee in order to
initiate garbage pickup service to the premises. Should any such tenant or
occupant of a leased premises or any property owner receiving garbage pickup
services within the city limits fail or refuse to pay the charges herein
specified on the date the same shall become due and payable, such occupant
shall have his garbage service suspended, the deposit posted for such unit
shall be forfeited and applied against any outstanding garbage bill assessed
against such occupant; in addition thereto, the Environmental Health Officer
shall be notified immediately of cases of terminated service for appropriate
action in accordance with the health and sanitation regulations set forth in
Chapter 96 of this code and any other applicable ordinance of the city. The
deposit herein required shall be refunded to the customer upon termination of
service and the payment of all services charges then due and owing. All
security deposits are to be held by the city and shall not bear interest while
in the city's possession.
   (C)   All trash carts shall remain the property of the city and shall be
surrendered upon termination of service. Any account unable to furnish cart
upon termination shall be billed for the replacement cost of said cart.

horizon, formation strata or depth for the purpose of producing water for any
use.
   (B)   Drilling of water wells will not be allowed within the city limits

following exception:
      (1)   Adequate public water supply, as determined by the Water Utilities
Superintendent, does not exist within 660 feet (1/8 mile) of the property line
or cannot be made available in a reasonable time. If such is the case, the
person(s) desiring to drill a water well may apply to the City Council for
permission to drill the well. The City Council shall hold a hearing on such
application and shall obtain a recommendation from a competent water engineer
familiar with water strata in the county. The cost of such investigation and
report shall be paid for by the person(s) making such application.
      (2)   After such hearing and necessary investigation by the City Council,

water supply, then the City Council may grant such applicant a permit to drill
such water well.
      (3)   A person commits an offense if the person causes, allows, or

(1/8 mile) of the property line.
      (4)   Any person found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this
section shall be fined not more than $2,000. Each day that a violation is
permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense.

RATES, CHARGES AND COLLECTIONS
§ 51.015 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE, TRANSFER OR FINAL; CONTENTS OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   Application required.  A person shall not use a service without first
making the proper application for the service with the Water Utilities
Department. For general service accounts, a written application will be
required of those persons desiring service. The application must be made on
forms provided by the Water Utilities Department. The Utility Manager is
authorized to establish other procedures, not in conflict with this chapter or
state law, to process and accept customer applications and to collect and
process security deposits as necessary to secure customer accounts.
   (B)   Restriction of application.  The person making the application shall
include that person's spouse, if any, as an applicant on the application. If
unmarried or unrelated individuals or unrelated business entities who jointly
own or occupy premises desire service, the Utility Manager may require
application to be made jointly in the names of those individuals or business
entities. The Utility Manager may also require application for service to be
made only by and in the name of the owner of property if the Utility Manager
determines that substantial risk of financial loss to the Utility Department
would occur as a result of acceptance of an application for a person other than
the owner. Only adults over the age of 17 years of age or those persons 17
years of age and under who are or have been married shall be allowed to make
application for utility service.
   (C)   Contract. The application constitutes a contract to pay all charges
for service and to abide by all provisions of this chapter, the provisions of
this code, and other local, state and federal laws relating to the service.
   (D)   Accurate information. An applicant shall furnish the names and
addresses of any other joint owners, regardless of whether or not they reside
at the premises, if this information if known to the applicant. An applicant
shall also furnish proper identification and shall correctly furnish any other
relevant information, including but not limited to proof of ownership or
agency, required by the Utility Department in order to properly provide the
service. If information is not furnished or is false, the application may be
denied and service, where provided, may be discontinued. A person commits an
offense if he knowingly makes a false statement on an application for service
under this chapter.
   (E)   Use without application. A person who occupies premises and uses
service without making application is responsible for all water used from the
date of the last meter reading previous to that person occupying the premises.
If the person is a tenant and the owner of the premises failed to give notice
required by this chapter, then the owner is jointly and severally liable with
the tenant for the charges.
   (F)   Outstanding balance of applicant. If any person, firm or corporation
applies to the city for service and it is determined by the Utility Department
that such person, firm or corporation is indebted to the city on any previous
utility account, such service shall not be connected, or if discovered later,
shall be disconnected until full payment, plus any charges, is received by the
Utility Department.
   (G)   Transfer accounts.
      (1)   For all customers requesting a transfer of service from one place
to another within the city, such request may be made by telephone. Person
requesting transfer will be required to identify the correct utility account by
giving the following information:
         (a)   Account Number.
         (b)   Customer Name.
         (c)   Service Address.
      (2)   A transfer fee shall be charged in accordance with §
51.034(A).
   (H)   Final accounts. For all customers requesting to terminate their
utility service, such request may be made by telephone. Persons requesting

by giving the following information:
      (1)   Account Number.
      (2)   Customer Name.
      (3)   Service Address.
   (I)   Meters for multi-unit service. Any structure having multi-unit design,
whether multiple dwelling units or multiple business units, shall be required
to provide a separate water main tap and meter for each unit if the tenant is
responsible for the utility bill. If the entire water service to the structure
is paid by the owner or landlord, then only one water main tap and meter shall

      (1)   The customer account number;
      (2)   The customer name and service address;
      (3)   The service date period and the due date;

the bill is paid by the due date; and
      (5)   The amount, including the late payment penalty as set out in
division (B) of this section, if not paid on or before the due date.
   (B)   When charges are delinquent — bill items. Except where otherwise

become delinquent if payment is not received by the Water Utilities Department
on or before the due date, which is a minimum of ten days after bill rendering.
After the due date, the customer must pay the bill amount plus a 10% late
penalty. The Water Utilities Department shall send the customer a notice of
discontinuance indicating, but not limited to:
      (1)   The customer account number;
      (2)   The customer name and service address;
      (3)   The service date and the due date;

delinquent charges, plus penalty); and
      (5)   The amount, including the late payment penalty.

Department does not relieve a customer or other person liable for charges under
this chapter from liability for service.
   (D)   Authority to discontinue service. The Utility Manager may refuse
application for service, discontinue service, or refuse to restore service to:
      (1)   A customer who fails to pay any charges due under this chapter
within seven days after the sending of notice of discontinuance;
      (2)   A person who violates any portion of:

substantial waste of water, or a health hazard is occurring as a result of
leaking, damaged, open or disconnected private laterals, pipes, or drains on
the premises.

connections to private property. The costs of cutting and plugging connections
will be charged to the customer in addition to the delinquent charges due.

until the customer or other person who has or accepts legal responsibility for
violations committed or charges unpaid either pays all charges due (including
the charges to restore connections), makes arrangements for payment
satisfactory to the Utility Manager, or, where applicable, ceases violation of
the particular code provision in question. The decision to restore service
while delinquent charges or code violations still exist rests solely with the
Utility Manager.

      (2)   Damage to city or private property; or
      (3)   Contamination of the water system.
   (I)   Customer's request to discontinue service. Upon a customer's request
for discontinuance of service, the Utility Manager may discontinue treated or
untreated water service to the customer. Upon receipt of the application for
termination, the Utility Manager may remove the water meter and service
connections. However, the customer is liable for all charges incurred prior to
removal of the meter. Where service is furnished through more than one meter,
the customer may request discontinuance of one or more meters and thereafter be
billed on the basis of the remaining meter or meters.
   (J)   Penalty fee not charged. Persons, with single-family residential
accounts, who are 65 years of age or older may request an exemption from the
late payment charge. This is to accommodate those persons who receive their
social security checks later than they receive the utility bill. This exemption
shall apply to only one residential account at a time, and shall remain in
effect, without renewal, as long as the account name does not change. Proof of
age shall be required.
   (K)   Cumulative remedies. Enforcement of this section does not waive any
additional remedies, civil or criminal, available to the city under law.

§ 51.022 (RESERVED).
§ 51.023 METERS — REQUIRED; READ MONTHLY; CHARGE; WATER LEAKAGE.
   (A)   Meters generally. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, a
customer shall receive water service only when measured through a meter. The
Utility Manager shall determine the size, type, number, and location of meters
and connections to meters to be installed. Each meter shall be read, when
possible, once a month and a bill rendered accordingly.
   (B)   Meters reading. The meters shall be read to the nearest cubic foot
monthly at approximately the same time each month.
   (C)   Estimated bill circumstances.  The quantity of water delivered to a
premises may be estimated under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   The meter reader is unable to procure a reading of the meter
because access to the meter is obstructed or made hazardous by an animal or
circumstance.
      (2)   The meter does not properly function, or the equipment used to read
the meter does not properly function.
      (3)   Adverse weather or an act of God prevents the reading of the meter.
      (4)   No meter is in place at the premises.
      (5)   For some other reason, a meter reading is not available to the
billing section of the Utility Department at the time of preparing a bill to a
customer.
   (D)   Basis for estimate. An estimate shall be based on past consumption
experience at the premises. If there is no past consumption experience, then an
estimate will be based on consumption of the same class under similar
conditions using the best information available. If a customer demonstrates
that an estimated bill is excessive, then the Utility Department shall render a
bill based on a revised estimate.
   (E)   Meter reading verification. If the customer contends that a
discrepancy appears in a bill or meter reading, the Utility Manager will
inspect the meter and verify the reading, or cause same to be done.
   (F)   Water leakage.  
      (1)   When a customer experiences a substantial increase in water or
wastewater usage from a hidden water leak, the Utility Department will adjust
the amount and bill the customer in accordance with the rates prescribed in §
51.030. The Utility Department will adjust a bill only if a customer presents a
plumber's statement, or the customer's written statement, which indicates the
water leak was not reasonably detectable from the surface, the leak has been
repaired, and the type of repairs made. The Utility Manager may request
additional information before determining if a water leak was reasonably
detectable based upon facts presented to the Utility Manager. A customer may
receive only one adjustment during a 12-month period, unless the Utility
Manager determines that extenuating circumstances justify allowing additional
adjustments.
      (2)   The leak adjustment will be 40% of the increased billing due to the
leak for the month the leak is repaired and the previous month if leakage was
occurring.
      (3)   The adjustment will be calculated as follows: determine an average
usage for that month using the three previous years. That usage which exceeds
the average will be adjusted 40%.
   (G)   Return of meters. All water meters furnished to customers are property
of the city and will be returned immediately upon request of the Utility
Manager. Failure to return a meter when requested constitutes grounds for
discontinuance or refusal of service.
   (H)   Maintenance of meters. The Utility Department is responsible for
maintenance, inspection and repair of all water meters. When any act, neglect
or carelessness of the customer or owner of any premises causes damage to a
meter requiring adjustment, repair or replacement, the resulting expense will
be charged against the customer or owner.

work. At no time will the meter and meter box be allowed to be buried.
   (C)   Request to move meter. The owner or occupant of premises adversely
affected by the location of a meter bay make written application to the Utility
Manager to have the device moved, under the following conditions:
      (1)   The Utility Manager may approve the application if he determines
that the move will not interfere with normal Department operations and will not
cause damage to the water system. The decision of the Utility Manager is final.
      (2)   Upon the approval of the application, the Utility Manager will
furnish the applicant an estimate of costs to move the meter.
      (3)   Upon deposit of the estimated cost by the applicant, the Utility
Department will make the agreed change in location.

§ 51.025 REVENUE COLLECTION REGULATIONS.
   The Utility Manager is authorized to promulgate regulations and procedures,
not in conflict with this code, the city charter, or applicable state and
federal laws or regulations, concerning the collection of charges for services

(Ord. 10-1993-36, passed 10-12-93)
§ 51.026 JOINT OWNERS OR USERS; LIABILITY; TRANSFER OF ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   Charges a lien. When delinquent charges remain unpaid and the
procedures of §
51.027 are followed, those delinquent charges shall constitute a lien against
the property served.
   (B)   Personal liability. The customer of record has the primary personal
liability for services rendered under this chapter. Nevertheless, if service is
provided to property owned by a person or entity jointly with the customer of
record, or if the customer of record is an agent or property manager for one or
more owners of property, the joint owners shall not be treated as new
customers, but shall remain jointly and severally liable with the customer of
record for unpaid delinquent charges. The Utility Manager may refuse or
discontinue service in the same manner provided for in §
51.016 until all delinquent charges are paid.
   (C)   Liability of spouses. Spouses receiving service to premises they
jointly own or occupy are deemed to be joint customers of record,
notwithstanding that only one spouse may have signed an application, and shall
be jointly and severally liable for unpaid delinquent charges.
   (D)   Liability of tenants. Where service is provided to a tenant in a
single-family residence, or to more than one residential or commercial tenant
through a master meter or single service connection, and the landlord is the
customer of record, a tenant or duly organized association of tenants may
establish a new service account without being held responsible for any previous
unpaid charges owed by the landlord if the appropriate facilities are in place
and the tenant or association of tenants otherwise meets the applicable
requirements of this chapter; however, the Utility Manager may refuse service
if it appears the application is being made for the purpose of assisting the
landlord to avoid payment of delinquent charges or for the purpose of
defrauding the city. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require
the Utility Department to apportion charges or to provide individually-metered
service at a master-metered premises.
   (E)   Transfer of accounts. Where a person liable for delinquent charges at
one address is found to have an account in his name at another address, the
delinquent amounts due at the previous address shall be transferred to the
account at the new address, and service discontinued at the new address until
the delinquent amounts are paid.

perfect the lien upon property which occurs as provided in §
51.026, for the purpose of securing the payment of delinquent charges incurred

delinquent charges for service where a tenant is the customer of record, if the
owner of the property served has sent notice to the Utility Manager that the
property is rental property.
   (B)   When lien is perfected. The lien may be perfected only when charges
incurred by a customer for service become delinquent and when the Utility
Manager determines that other means for fully collecting the delinquency are
inadequate or unavailable.
   (C)   Form of lien. Upon request of the Utility Manager, the form of the
lien must be prepared by the City Attorney. The form must contain:
      (1)   A statement indicating the purpose of the lien;
      (2)   The address of the property which is the subject of the lien, where
the address is ascertainable;

of the lien; and
      (4)   The amount of delinquent charges, including penalties, interest and
collection costs, if any, incurred upon the property as of the date of
execution of the lien.
   (D)   Execution and recording. The lien must be:
      (1)   Executed by the City Manager and acknowledged by a notary public of
the state;
      (2)   Approved as to form by the City Attorney; and
      (3)   Filed in the deed or lien records of the county.
   (E)   Priority of lien. The lien is superior to all other liens except a
bona fide mortgage lien recorded prior to the recording of the city's lien in
the deed or lien records of the county.
   (F)   Additional charges; correction lien. Should additional delinquent
charges be incurred subsequent to the date of the original lien's execution, a
correction lien may be executed and filed, in the form provided above, fixing
the additional delinquent charges. The correction lien, when filed of record,
shall relate back to the date of recording of the original lien and shall
become a part of the original lien.
   (G)   Suit to foreclose. The City Attorney, at the request of the Utility
Manager, may file suit to judicially foreclose the lien in a state court of
competent jurisdiction. The suit may not be filed earlier than 60 days after
the recording date of the lien.
   (H)   Release of lien. Upon certification of the Utility Manager that all
delinquent charges which existed against the property have been fully paid, the
City Manager is authorized to execute a release of the lien. The release shall
be prepared and approved as to form by the City Attorney and shall be duly
acknowledged. After execution, the Utility Manager must immediately file the
release in the deed or lien records of the county.
   (I)   Cumulative remedies. This section is cumulative of any other remedies,
methods of collection or security available to the Utility Manager or the city
under the charter and ordinances of the city or under state law. This section
does not affect the Utility Manager's authority to refuse or to furnish service
when delinquent charges exist.

Manager shall send notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that a
lien will be fixed on the property in accordance with law. The notice must
provide a time, place and means by which the charges causing the lien may be
paid or disputed. The notice must be sent to:
      (1)   The customer in whose name the account for service to the property
exists; and
      (2)   The last known record owner of the property according to the tax
rolls of the city, if the customer is not the owner.
   (B)   Absence of notice. Absence of receipt of notice does not affect the
enforceability of a lien perfected under §
51.027.
(Ord. 10-1993-36, passed 10-12-93)
§ 51.029 USING ANOTHER PERSON'S WATER; USE BEFORE FILING APPLICATION FOR
SERVICE.
   (A)   Use without consent. A person commits an offense if where water is
furnished to any premises, the person knowingly takes water from any faucet or
water connection on the premises without first securing the consent of, and
making arrangements with, the owner of the premises or the customer in whose
name the account exists. This section does not apply to a person employed by
the city who is engaged in work of an emergency nature in his official capacity
as a city employee.
   (B)   Use without application.  A person commits an offense if he knowingly
diverts or uses water from any part of the water system without making
application and without receiving the Utility Manager's consent to use a
service. Absence of an account for service on file with the Utility Department
constitutes prima facie proof of the lack of the Utility Manager's consent to
use a service.

§ 51.039 CITY RELEASED FROM LIABILITY IF CUSTOMER CANNOT BE PRESENT WHEN WATER
SERVICE IS INITIATED.
   (A)   Release of liability.
      (1)   Normally, the customer should be present when water service is
turned on in order to avoid inadvertent water damage due to faucets being open,
broken pipes, and the like. Appointments will be made for this purpose. If a
customer or his authorized agent cannot be present, the customer may sign a
form provided in the Utility Billing Office which releases the city from
liability for any damages at the customer's service address as a result of
turning on the water.
      (2)   The release of liability must be signed by the customer in whose
name an account is being established. The customer is agreeing that he assumes
responsibility for damages that may result when the water is turned on. The
signer of the document must present identification, have his signature
witnessed, and the document notarized.
      (3)   Under no circumstances will water be turned on unless the customer
is present at the service address or has provided the city with the release of
liability.
   (B)   Exception.  If at the time water is turned on a leak is suspected, the
water will be turned off again. The customer or his authorized agent bust be
present when the water is turned on again and a $10 service fee will be
required for the additional service call.

   (A)   The Water Utilities Department shall have the right to temporarily
discontinue, disconnect, and reconnect water supply without notice to all
customers for the purposes of making repairs, connections, extensions, and
cleaning of mains, machinery, reservoirs or any part of the water system. The
Water Utilities Department shall have the right to temporarily disconnect
service to a customer having a break on their private line should that break
present a hazard to the general public. None of the terms of this chapter shall
ever be construed as requiring the Water Utilities Department to maintain a
specific constant pressure in its lines.
   (B)   All persons having devices such as, but not limited to, boilers or air
conditioning equipment which utilize, employ, or make use of water in any
manner whatsoever, which may become damaged due to interruption of water
service, and which are supplied directly with city water, do so at their own
risk. The city shall not be liable for any damage that may occur as a result of
the water being cut off for any purpose, or as a result of the breaking of any
pipe or fixture by pressure of the water from the city mains.

Department and separately maintained from the other Water and Wastewater Fund,
to be designated the Water/Wastewater Rate Mitigation and Capital Improvement
Trust Reserve (the Reserve).
   (B)   The Water/Wastewater Rate Mitigation and Capital Improvement Reserve
shall be accounted for in the Water and Wastewater Fund.
   (C)   Contributions may vary from year to year when the Water and Wastewater
Fund has produced a surplus after payment of all operation and maintenance
expenses, debt service, and required contributions to reserves, if any.
Contributions shall be added to such Fund per the above criteria.
   (D)   At the option of the City Council, other sources of surplus finds, if
available, may be used to contribute to the Fund.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that any
contribution to the Fund is mandatory, but such will be solely at the
discretion of the City Council.

§ 51.042 EXPENDITURES FROM THE WATER/WASTEWATER RATE MITIGATION RESERVE;
PROHIBITED EXPENDITURES.
   (A)   Withdrawals from the Fund require the authorization of the City
Council. At the time of withdrawal, a plan to replenish the Fund over a
reasonable time frame shall be adopted by the City Council. The plan may or may
not include a rate increase, depending on the circumstances.
   (B)   Withdrawals from the Fund should be restricted to:
      (1)   Make up for a severe shortfall in funds where projected revenues
are not met, typically because of unusually wet weather or other unexpected
negative influence on revenue stream;
      (2)   Pay for catastrophic repair events of such magnitude that the cost
of such would initiate an unplanned rate increase or a greater than planned
rate increase (i.e. increases that would not have been needed if such event had
not occurred);
      (3)   Smooth a sharp rate increase necessitated by sudden increase in an
uncontrollable, ongoing expense; and/or
      (4)   To pay for capital improvement projects as necessary. At the time
of any such withdrawal, a plan to raise rates over a reasonable time period to
a level sufficient to cover the ongoing cost of the utility should be presented
to the Council and adopted.
   (C)   Withdrawal from the Fund should not be allowed for the following
reasons:
      (1)   To make any expenditure not clearly and directly for the operation,
maintenance, or repair of the water or wastewater system, or to stabilize the
rate structures thereof;
      (2)   To pay for expense made necessary as a result of growth, expansion,
or enhancement of existing services or inflation; or
      (3)   For the addition of permanent personnel or equipment.

sanitary sewer service. A charge, which shall be known as the “pro rata,” shall
be made against each lot or tract of land, and the owner thereof, whose water
or sewer line shall be hereafter connected to any water mains or sewer mains in
the city, and the charge shall be based on the following:
      (1)   Based upon the actual cost of installation to include all
engineering and appurtenances as reflected in a bonded contract.
      (2)   One-half of the cost to be distributed to property on each side of
the line or street.
   (B)   The above front foot rates shall apply to property fronting on streets
in areas platted into the usual rectangular lots or tracts of land, with a
depth of not to exceed 150 feet, where lots or tracts have a greater depth than
150 feet from the front street line, and are occupied or to be occupied
exclusively as dwelling places, then the additional depth shall not be
assessed. If the property is later subdivided, requiring an extension of mains
to serve same, then the terms of this subchapter shall govern. On lots or
tracts of land which extend through from one street to another with frontage on
both streets, and where the distance between the street lines is 260 feet or
more, then the pro rata charges herein provided shall be paid on both frontages
when a connection is secured to the lot or tract. where lots or tracts are
irregular in size or shape, then pro rata charges shall be based upon
equivalent rectangular lots or tracts using one front foot for each 150 square
feet of area, or the pro rata charges provided herein on the average frontage
of such tracts, whichever is least.
   (C)   Where lots or tracts are intended to be used for business, commercial,
or industrial purposes or have a depth greater than 150 feet from the front
street line, then the pro rata herein provided shall be paid on the frontage on
all streets which the property may abut minus 150 feet frontage for each corner
of the property abutting a street intersection. Should the property be
resubdivided whereby water and sewer mains extensions are required to serve
same, the terms of this subchapter shall apply.
   (D) In addition to the pro rata charge on water, the property owner must pay
a connection charge as established by the city.

§ 51.053 EXTENSION OF WATER AND SEWER LINES.
   (A)   Upon request of the owner, or his agent, of a given lot or tract of
land, for the purpose of this subchapter known as the “applicant,” accompanied
by the payment of the charges due under this subchapter, the city shall extend,
lay or construct all necessary sanitary sewer and water mains, including valves
and hydrants, a distance of 100 feet, plus the distance across the frontage
necessary to provide the service for which application has been made. The
property owner to be served shall be required to pay the charge herein provided
for. The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extension
shall be required to pay the charges provided for herein at such time as their
property is connected to the mains thus laid. Where an applicant for service
secured an extension and service under this particular option for main
extension, he shall pay the pro rata charges on all property owned by him which
is served by the extension requested. In applying the 100-foot rule, the
required extension of main shall be figured in such a manner as to leave out of
the calculation that portion of any main adjacent to property already having
other than a temporary water service and for which the pro rata charges thereon
have been paid or credited under the terms of this subchapter. Only one
extension under the 100-foot rule will be given to an individual during a 12-
month period.
   (B)   An exception to the above 100-foot rule shall be made where two or
more individual applicants desire water and/or sewer service and the nearest
applicant is more than 100 feet from existing lines, the city will extend their
mains upon payment of the charge due under this subchapter, provided, that
there is one customer for every 100 feet of such extension, excluding street
intersections and that portion of the extension adjacent to property already
having other than temporary water and/or sewer service.
   (C)   At the option of the city the following method for extending water and
sewer mains may be used where the applicant's property is more than 100 feet
from an existing water and sewer main. This method shall be available only for
use by an individual owner, person or corporation to secure water and sewer
service for the individual's residence or place of business. Where eligible for
this option, the owner may advance and pay into the city, the entire pro rata
costs, as set forth in this subchapter.

      PRETREATMENT. The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination
of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to or in lieu of introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or
biological processes, by process changes, or by other means, except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless dilution is allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard.
      PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS. Any substantive or procedural requirement
related to pre-treatment imposed on an industrial user, other than a
pretreatment standard.
      PRETREATMENT STANDARD or STANDARDS. Prohibitive discharge standards,

Subchapter N; and any other industrial user that discharges an average of
25,000 gpd or more of process wastewater, contributes a process waste stream
which makes up 5% or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic
capacity of the POTW's wastewater treatment plant, or is designated as
significant by the city on the basis that the industrial user has a reasonable
potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any
pretreatment standard or requirements (in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6)).
      SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE (SNC). The Superintendent shall publish
annually (in April), in a newspaper of general circulation that provides

§ 51.073 GENERAL SEWER REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Prohibited discharge standards. No industrial user shall introduce or
cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes
or contributes to pass through or interference. These general prohibitions
apply to all industrial users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to
categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirement. Furthermore, no industrial user may
contribute the following pollutants, substances or wastewater to the POTW:
      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal
wastewater collection and POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams
with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      (2)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or more than 11.0, or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment, or
endangering city personnel.
      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction
of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference with proper operation of the
POTW, such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings,
sawdust, metal, glass, glue, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, whole blood,
paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, lime slurry, lime residues, slops,
chemical residues, paint residues, bulk solids, and paper products, either
whole or ground by garbage grinder.
      (4)   Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen demanding
pollutants (BOD and the like), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or
pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with either the POTW or any wastewater
treatment or sludge process, or which will constitute a hazard to humans or
animals.
      (5)   Any wastewater having a temperature greater than 150°F (65°C), or
which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in
interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104°F (40°C).
      (6)   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, products of mineral
oil origin, gasoline, benzene, fuel oil, or other flammable or explosive
liquid, solid or gas, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
      (7)   Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.
      (8)   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the city in accordance with §§
51.074 and
51.101.
      (9)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry
into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
      (10)   Any garbage that has not been properly comminuted or shredded. If
properly comminuted or shredded, then it may be accepted under provisions
established in §
51.072(A) under the definition of “properly shredded garbage”.
      (11)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes
except as specifically approved by the Superintendent in compliance with
applicable state or federal regulations.
      (12)   Storm water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water,
roof runoff, subsurface drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact
cooling water, and unpolluted industrial wastewater, unless specifically
authorized by the Superintendent.
      (13)   Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment
of industrial wastes.
      (14)   Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the
Superintendent in a wastewater discharge permit.
      (15)   Any wastewater causing the treatment plant's effluent to fail a
toxicity test, violate its NPDES, TPDES, or TCEQ permit or create a hazard in
the receiving waters.
      (16)   Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other
substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW or in discharges from
the POTW.
      (17)   Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's
effluent thereby violating the city's TPDES permit.
      (18)   Any wastes or wastewater that may deposit grease or oil in the
sewer lines in such a manner as to clog the sewers, overload skimming and
grease handling equipment, pass to the receiving waters without being
effectively treated by normal wastewater treatment processes due to the
nonamenability of the substances to bacterial action, or deleteriously affect
the POTW treatment processes.
      (19)   Any waste or wastes not identified in the city's application for a
wastewater discharge permit that the city has not specifically authorized for
discharge.
   (B)   Discharge prohibited. Wastes prohibited by division (A) of this
section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located in process or materials
storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility
before connecting with the POTW.
   (C)   National categorical pretreatment standards. The national categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405
through 471 are hereby incorporated by reference and shall be treated as if set
forth in full herein.
      (1)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
      (2)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Superintendent
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
   (D)   State pretreatment standards. TCEQ's pretreatment regulations for
existing and new sources of pollution, found at 30 TAC Chapter 315, which adopt
by reference certain portions of 40 CFR 403, are hereby incorporated by
reference and shall be treated as if set forth in full herein.
   (E)   Specific pollutant limitations or local limits.
      (1)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against
pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing
in excess of the following instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits:
         Pollutants            Limits, mg/l
         Arsenic            0.059
         Oil and Grease         200
         Cadmium            0.056
         Chromium (Hex)         0.146
         Copper            1.770
         Cyanide (Total)         0.117
         Lead               0.307
         Mercury            0.001
         Nickel               0.438
         Pollutants            Limits, mg/l
         pH               5.5-11 standard units
         Silver               0.131
         Zinc               0.719
      (2)   The city will set limits on a permit by permit basis for Chromium
(total). These limits are provided in Subpart F of the Standard Operating
Procedures and Table 2 and 10 of the most current local limits. The city will
provide notice and an opportunity to comment on local limits to industrial
users and the public, pursuant to 40 CFR 403.11.
      (3)   The city will set limits on a permit by permit basis for TDS. These
limits are provided in Subpart F of the Standard Operating Procedures and Table
6 of the most current local limits. The city will provide notice and an
opportunity to comment on local limits for TDS to industrial users and the
public, pursuant to 40 CFR 403.11.
      (4)   Concentrations apply at the point where the industrial waste is
discharged to the POTW (end of pipe).
      (5)   Mass limitations for SIUs. The Superintendent may impose mass
limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations
above. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that
the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits shall be determined with the
discretion of the city. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if
the industrial user meets all the following conditions in 40 CFR § 403.6 (c)(5)
(i) and is subject to the conditions described on (c)(5)(ii) of the same
section.
      (6)   Concentration limits for categorical SIUs. The city may convert the
mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards at 40 CFR parts 414, 419,
and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations
applicable to individual industrial users under the conditions described in 40
CFR § 403.6(c)(6). When converting such limits to concentration limits, the
city shall use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR
parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for
treatment as prohibited by 40 CFR § 403.6 (d).
   (F)   City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in §
51.070 or the general and specific prohibitions in divisions (A) and (B) of
this section.
   (G)   Special agreement.
      (1)   The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with
industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to
the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may request
a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR
403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment
standard from EPA.
      (2)   Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can
prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from
the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An
industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must
comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
   (H)   Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process
water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, unless expressly authorized
by the city pursuant to an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Superintendent may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (I)   Best management practices. The city may develop best management
practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits,
to implement Local Limits and the requirements of section §
51.073(A). BMPs that are enforceable pretreatment standards are required to
include the following: categorical standards that have BMPs (or pollution
prevention alternative) and/or local limits and/or other pretreatment
standards, if applicable. The city shall notify and submit a request to modify
its approved program to the Approval Authority, any new BMPs prior to
implementation.
   (J)   Non-significant categorical industrial user. City may develop and
issue permits for NSCIUs.

Ord. 02-2006-16, passed 2-28-06; Am. Ord. 04-2020-24, passed 4-14-20)
§ 51.074 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment facilities.
      (1)   Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits
and the prohibitions set out in §
51.073 above within the time limitations specified by the EPA, TCEQ, or the
Superintendent, whichever is more stringent, if applicable. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under
the provisions of this subchapter. The city shall require the industrial user
to verify prior to discharge that wastes authorized to be discharged will
receive suitable treatment within the provisions of laws, regulations,
subchapters, rules and orders of federal, state and local government.
      (2)   Industrial users responsible for discharges through a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall, at his or her own expense and as
required by the city, install an accessible and safely located control manhole,
install meters and other appurtenances to facilitate observation sampling and
measurement of the waste, and maintain the equipment and facilities.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require
industrial users to control the quantities and rates of discharge during peak
flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into
specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, require pretreatment of
unacceptable discharges, require payment to cover the cost of handling and
treating wastes, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of
this subchapter.
      (2)   The city has the authority to reject and refuse discharges or
proposed discharges from the industrial users. If discharges or proposed
discharges to the public sewer system may deleteriously affect wastewater
facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, create a hazard to life
or health, or create a public nuisance, the city will refuse acceptance of the
waste.
      (3)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be required when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, oil, sand, flammable wastes
or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for residential users. All interceptors shall be of type and capacity
approved by the Superintendent and shall be so located to be easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be installed, inspected,
cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his or her expense.
   (C)   Accidental discharge/slug control plans.
      (1)   The Superintendent may require any industrial user to develop and
implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The city will evaluate the
SIU, within one year of being designated an SIU, to determine whether such SIU
needs a plan or other action to control slug discharges (40 CFR § 403.8(f)(2)
(vi)). The city shall keep records of the activities associated with slug
control evaluation, and results of such activities are required to be available
to the city upon request. The city shall also keep records of all information
resulting from any monitoring activities required by 40 CFR Part 403, including
documentation associated with BMPs. Any industrial user required to develop and
implement an accidental discharge/control slug plan shall submit a plan which
addresses, at a minimum, the following:
         (a)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges.
         (b)   Description of stored chemicals.
         (c)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental
or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the prohibited discharges in §
51.073.
         (d)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment for emergency response.
      (2)   The Superintendent shall regulate the flow and concentration of
slug loads when they may:
         (a)   Impair the treatment process, or cause interference or pass
through;
         (b)   Cause damage to collection facilities;
         (c)   Incur treatment costs exceeding those for normal wastewater; or
         (d)   Render the treated wastewater unfit for stream discharge or
reuse.
   (D)   Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to
any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the
owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held
responsible for compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (E)   Vandalism. No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person
found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set
out in §§
51.081 through
51.083.
   (F)   Fraud and false statements. No user may in any way falsify statements
or provide fraudulent information to the city. Any user that knowingly makes
any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application,
record, report, plan or other communication or documentation filed, or required
to be provided, performed or maintained, pursuant to this subchapter,
wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this subchapter shall be subject to the provisions of 40 CFR 403.12(n) and
penalties stipulated in §§
51.081 through
51.083.
(Ord. 12-1994-59, passed 12-13-94; Am. Ord. 08-2003-32, passed 4-26-03; Am.
Ord. 02-2006-16, passed 2-28-06; Am. Ord. 04-2020-24, passed 4-14-20)
§ 51.075 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ELIGIBILITY.
   (A)   Wastewater survey. When requested by the Superintendent, all
industrial users must submit information on the nature and characteristics of
their wastewater by completing a wastewater survey prior to commencing their
discharge. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose
and may periodically require industrial users to update the survey. Failure to
complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the
industrial user and shall be considered a violation of the subchapter.
   (B)   Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to
discharge wastewater into the city's POTW without first obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit from the Superintendent. Any violation of the terms and
conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this
subchapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set
out in §§
51.081 through
51.083. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of
its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or
requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require other industrial users, including
liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to
carry out the purposes of this subchapter.
   (C)   Wastewater discharge permitting - existing connections. Any
significant industrial user which discharges industrial waste into the POTW
prior to the effective date of this subchapter and which wishes to continue
such discharges in the future, shall, within 120 days after said date, apply to
the city for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with this section, and
shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 120 days of
the effective date of this subchapter except in accordance with a wastewater
discharge permit issued by the Superintendent.
   (D)   Wastewater discharge permitting - new connections. Any significant
industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging industrial wastes
into the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to the beginning
or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge
permit must be filed at least 120 days prior to the date upon which any
discharge will begin.
   (E)   Extrajurisdictional industrial users. The city does not extend sewage
lines outside of the City of Cleburne Certificate of Convenience and Necessity
(CCN) service area or accept hauled wastes from sources outside of the CCN.
Therefore, the city will not accept permit requests from potential industrial
users outside of the CCN. Customers within the CCN that receive wastewater
service will enter the city’s customer service agreement and where applicable
an industrial user wastewater discharge permit.
   (F)   Wastewater discharge permit application contents.
      (1)   In order to be considered for a wastewater discharge permit, all
industrial users required to have a wastewater discharge permit must submit the
information required by this subchapter. The Superintendent shall approve a
form to be used as a permit application. In addition, the following information
may be requested:
         (a)   Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on
the premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or
stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be,
discharged to the POTW.
         (b)   Number and type of employees, hours of operation, and proposed
or actual hours of discharge to the POTW.
         (c)   Each product produced by type, amount, process or processed, and
rate of production, and the process waste stream(s) to be discharged to the
POTW.
         (d)   Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum
per day).
         (e)   The site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and
details to show all sewers, floor drains, and appurtenances by size, location,
and elevation, and all points of discharge.
         (f)   Time and duration of the discharge.
         (g)   Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the
Superintendent to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application.
         (h)   Pursuant to 33 U.S.C.A. 1318(a), consent for the Superintendent
or any other duly authorized person to have access to records or right of entry
to the property of the applicant.
      (2)   Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and
will be returned to the industrial user for revision.
   (G)   Application signatories and certification. All wastewater discharge
permit applications, industrial user reports, correspondence and documents of
any kind submitted to the city, shall contain the following certification
statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user:
“I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
   (H)   Wastewater discharge permit decisions. The Superintendent will
evaluate the data furnished by the industrial user and may require additional
information. Within 120 days of receipt of a complete wastewater discharge
permit application, the Superintendent will determine whether or not to issue a
wastewater discharge permit. If no determination is made within this time
period, the application will be deemed denied. The Superintendent may deny any
application for a wastewater discharge permit.
   (I)   Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit. The Superintendent may grant
a wastewater discharge permit to discharge industrial wastewater to the POTW to
an industrial user meeting all requirements of this subchapter provided that

POTW from regulated processes.
         (d)   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured averaged
daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated
process streams and other streams; as necessary, to allow use of the combined
wastestreams formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6.
         (e)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   Information concerning the categorical pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process.
            2.   The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature
and concentration (and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the city)
of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process.
Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations (or mass,
where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in
division (J) of this section. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires
compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention (P2) alternative, the user shall
submit documentation as required by the CA or applicable standards to determine
compliance with the standard.
            3.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in division (K) of this section.
         (f)   Certification. A statement reviewed by the industrial user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating

whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. To assess and assure
compliance, the SIU must submit compliance schedule progress reports. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out
in division (B) of this section.
         (h)   All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
51.075.
   (B)   Compliance schedule progress report. The following conditions shall
apply to the schedule required by subdivision (A)(2)(g) of this section. The
schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting
routine operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months.
The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no
event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the
Superintendent.
   (C)   Compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline report.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the city a report containing the information described in subdivisions (A)(2)
(d) through (f). For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial
user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
51.075(G).
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   Any significant user or significant industrial user subject to a
pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the Superintendent
but in no case less than twice per year (except for IUs which fall under the
NSCIU category or qualify for a monitoring waiver or reduced monitoring per 40
CFR §§ 403.3(v)(2), 403.8(f)(2)(v), 403.12 (e)(1), (2) and (3)), submit a
report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge
which are limited by such pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention
(P2) alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the CA or
applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. All periodic
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
51.075(G).
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial
user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall
be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times at the expense of the permit holder. The failure of an industrial user to
keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the
industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
      (3)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and
of this section monitors any pollutant at the identified sampling location more
frequently than required by the POTW by using the procedures prescribed in
division (K) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included
in the report.
      (4)   If approved by the city, the industrial user may submit electronic
reports, however the user must submit hard copies of the documents within five
working days.
      (5)   Waiver of pollutant sampling.
         (a)   The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated,
through sampling and other technical factors, that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or, if present, is only
present at background levels from intake water, without any increase in the
pollutant due to activities of the industrial user.
         (b)   The authorization is subject to the following conditions:
            1.   The pollutant is determined to be present solely due to
sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility, provided that the sanitary
wastewater: is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard; and cm
includes no process wastewater.
            2.   The waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective
period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer
than five years. The industrial user must submit a new request for a waiver
when a subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit is granted.
            3.   The industrial user must provide data from at least one
sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at
the facility. The process wastewater sample must be representative of
wastewater from all processes.
            4.   The request for a waiver must be signed in accordance with §
51.072(A), under the definition of “authorized or duly authorized
representative of the industrial user,” and include the certification statement
in §
51.075(G).
            5.   Non-detectable sample results may be used as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA-approved method from Title 40, Code
of Federal Regulations, Part 136, as amended, with the lowest minimum detection
level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
            6.   Any waiver by the Superintendent must be included as a
condition in the industrial user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the industrial user in its request for the
waiver must be maintained by the Superintendent for a period of three years
after the expiration of the waiver.
            7.   The industrial user must certify that there has been no
increase of the pollutant in its wastestream due to its activities. The
certification must appear on all future reports, along with the statement in
Section 49-5ICm).
            8.   If a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to
be present because of changes occurring in the industrial user's operations,
the industrial user must immediately comply with the sampling requirements of §
51.077(D)(1) or other more frequent sampling requirements imposed by the
Superintendent; and notify the Superintendent.
            9.   This division does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise provided in the categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to
notify the Superintendent of any planned significant changes to the industrial
user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of
its wastewater at least 120 days before the change.
      (1)   The Superintendent may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
51.075(F).
      (2)   The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
51.075(H) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
51.076(D).
      (3)   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s)
until and unless the Superintendent has responded to the industrial user's
notice.
      (4)   For purposes of this requirement flow increases of 10% or greater,
and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed
significant.
      (5)   Notification is required in advance of any substantial change in
the volume or character of pollutant in the discharge, including listed or
hazardous wastes for which the IU has submitted initial notification under 40
CFR 403.12(p).
      (6)   Notification is required for any discharge of hazardous waste in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(p) and §
51.077(I).
   (F)   Report of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a slug discharge, or a slug load which may cause or
have the potential to cause problems for the POTW (including a violation of the
prohibited discharge, discharge standards in §
51.073(A)), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately
telephone and notify the Superintendent of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user
shall, unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by the Superintendent or the city pursuant
to this subchapter.
      (3)   Failure to notify the city of discharges or potential discharges
that may cause interference or pass through, damage the POTW, or pose a threat
to POTW worker safety, or a threat to the general public, shall be deemed a
separate violation of this subchapter.
      (4)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a discharge described in division (F)(1) of this section. Employers
shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to
occur, are advised of emergency notification procedure.
      (5)   SIUs are required to notify the Superintendent immediately of any
changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
   (G)   Reports from nonsignificant industrial users.
      (1)   All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment
standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall
provide appropriate reports to the city as the Superintendent may require.
      (2)   Reports from non-significant categorical industrial users. All
NSCIUs pursuant to 40 CFR § 403.3(v)(2) shall annually submit the following
certification statement to the Superintendent, signed in accordance with the
signatory requirements in paragraph § 403.3(l). This certification must
accompany any alternative report required by the city:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR ____, I
certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period
from ________ ____, to ________, ____ [month, days, year]:
(a)   The facility described as ________ [facility name] met the definition of
a non-significant categorical Industrial User as described in § 403.3(v)(2);
(b) the facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards and
requirements during this reporting period; and (c) the facility never
discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical wastewater on any given
day during this reporting period. This compliance certification is based upon
the following information:
                                                                                                                           
   (H)   Notice of violation, repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must
notify the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to
resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user's facility or
plant at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the time
of the industrial user's initial sampling and the time when the industrial user
receives the results of this sampling, or if the POTW has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste
shall notify the POTW, EPA, and TCEQ authorities in writing of any discharge
into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of
the hazardous waste set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number,
and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user
proposed to discharge more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month
to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to
the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial
user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes,
an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste
stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed discharges must be submitted under division (E) of this section. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported under the self-monitoring requirements of §
51.073(A), (C), and (D).
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (I)(1) of
this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time predischarge notification. Subsequent months during which
the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste
do not require additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and TCEQ authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this division, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   (J)   Analytical requirements.
      (1)   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall
be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and
amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA and TCEQ.
      (2)   The city may select an independent firm or laboratory to collect
and analyze samples for which the city is responsible for under this
subchapter.
      (3)   The city has the authority to reject data from laboratories which
do not have adequate quality assurance and/or quality control procedures. Data
submitted in monitoring reports to the city must be legally defensible.
   (K)   Sample collection.
      (1)   Except as indicated in divisions (2) and (3) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, or time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Superintendent in the permit. Note: Daily discharge is
required to be defined as “the discharge of a pollutant” measured during a
calendar day or any 24-hour period that reasonably represents the calendar day
for purposes of sampling. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by
POTW, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits, if applicable.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §
51.077 (A) and (C) and 40 CFR § 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling
data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. Sampling
requirements, which previously only applied to BMRs and 90-day reports, extend
to reports on continued compliance and noncategorical SIU reports (40 CFR
§403.12(g)(1) and (3)). For the reports required by paragraphs in §
51.077(D) and 40 CFR § 403.12(e) and § 403.12(h)), the industrial user is
required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The city
may require that more than four grab samples be taken and separately analyzed
to ensure that sampling is representative (where the city cannot verify that
previous techniques were representative, such data will not support the use of
this alternative practice). Where there is a change to existing IU operation,
(for example, the addition of treatment) historic data that does not represent
the current discharge will not be able to be used to justify a lower minimum of
grab samples.
      (4)   Non-detectable sample results. Non-detectable sample results may be
used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA
approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level
for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
      (5)   Where the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of
the industrial user, then the city shall perform the repeat sampling and
analysis. If the city notifies the industrial user of the violation and
requires the industrial user of the violation and requires the industrial user
to perform repeat sampling and analysis then submission of the results are due
within a 30 day time frame. Resampling is not required if the following are
performed: (1) the city performs the sampling at the IU at a frequency of at
least once per month or (2) the city performs sampling at the IU between the
time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the IU or the
city receives the results of this sampling [40 CFR §403.12(g)(2)].
      (6)   Sampling must be taken within a 24-hour period, however, the sample
should only be collected during the portion of the 24-hour period that the IU
is discharging from the regulated process and/or pretreatment unit (as long as
regulated process wastewater is flowing through the pretreatment unit). During
parts of the day when there is no discharge of process wastewater, standing
water shall not be disproportionately sampled and analyzed as it would not be
representative of the discharge from the IU. The city shall only approve a
sampling protocol that produces representative results and is based on
(operation conditions and physical configuration of the IU facility). The city
shall require documentation of site-specific circumstances prior to allowing
alternate sampling by including the alternate sampling in the IU control
mechanism. The city shall require documentation of how alternate sampling
techniques are representative of the discharge.
   (L)   Determination of noncompliance. The Superintendent may use a grab
sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
   (M)   Timing for submitted reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the
date of receipt of report shall govern.
   (N)   Record keeping.
      (1)   Any industrial user subject to reporting requirements established
in this subchapter shall maintain records of all information resulting from any
monitoring activities required by this subchapter, any additional records of
information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs
established under § 51.073. Such records shall include for all samples:
         (a)   The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the person or persons taking the samples;
         (b)   Dates analyses were performed;
         (c)   Who performed the analyses;
         (d)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
         (e)   The results of such analyses.
      (2)   Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection
and copying, all records and information required to be retained under this
subchapter. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning compliance with this subchapter, or where the industrial
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.

§ 51.078 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Inspection and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter 24
hours/day the sampling facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this subchapter, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is
being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements
thereof. Industrial users shall allow the Superintendent or his representatives
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
independent sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties. All significant industrial users will be subject to
annual inspections in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v).
      (1)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
TCEQ and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
      (2)   Pursuant to 33 U.S.C.A. 1318(a), the city, TCEQ and EPA shall have
the right to enter upon the industrial user's property for inspections,
sampling or metering, and/or require installation of such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
      (3)   The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring
equipment as it deems necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the industrial user at its sole expense. All other devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure
their accuracy, unless the need for more frequent calibration is indicated.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the
Superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the industrial user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the
industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this subchapter.
      (6)   Anyone acting under the authority of this section shall observe the
industrial user's rules and regulations concerning safety, internal security,
and fire protection.
      (7)   Except when caused by negligence or failure of the industrial user
to maintain safe conditions, the city shall indemnify the industrial user
against loss or damage to its property by city employees and against liability
claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the
industrial user and resulting from the city's sampling operation.
      (8)   The Superintendent and other duly authorized persons of the city
bearing proper credentials and identification are entitled to enter all private
properties through which the city holds a negotiated easement for the purpose
of:
         (a)   Inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, or repair;
         (b)   Maintenance of any portion of the sewerage system lying within
the easements; and
         (c)   Conducting any other authorized activity.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Superintendent, or any other duly authorized
person, including a state and federal representative, has been refused access
to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the
Superintendent has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this subchapter or that there is need to inspect as part of a
routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with the
requirements and provisions of this subchapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then upon application by the City Attorney, the Municipal Court
Judge of the city or other magistrate may issue a search and/or seizure warrant
describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant
shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property
described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the
Superintendent in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city. In the
event of an emergency affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be
made without the issuance of a warrant.

§ 51.079 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data related to an industrial user that is included in
reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater
discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction
unless the industrial user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted
at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information
should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by
the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES and/or TPDES programs, or
the city's pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and
other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.

§ 51.080 PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The city shall publish at least annually (in April), in a newspaper of
general circulation that provides meaningful notice within the jurisdiction(s)
served by the POTW, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous
12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements as defined in §
51.072 under “significant noncompliance”.

§ 51.081 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Phone call. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any user has
violated or is violating any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
requirement, the Superintendent or his or her agent may inform the noncompliant
industry via telephone. The Superintendent will attempt to speak to the
authorized industrial user contact and explain the violation. The information
received from the industrial user contact concerning the violation will be
documented along with the time and date of the call in the violation summary
file. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
this notice.
   (B)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any user
has violated or is violating any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
requirement, the Superintendent or his or her agent may serve upon the user a
written Notice of Violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
   (C)   Warning meetings. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any user has
violated or is violating any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
requirement, the Superintendent or his or her agent may hold a warning meeting
with the industrial user's authorized representative to discuss such violation.
Records of actions taken, attending personnel, and other notes from the warning
meeting will be put in the Violation Summary file. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first holding this meeting.
   (D)   Consent orders. The Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar orders
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance within a
time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions (F)
and (G) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (E)   Show cause hearing. The Superintendent may order any user which causes
or contributes to violation(s) of any provisions of this subchapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, to appear before the Superintendent and show cause why
an enforcement action should not be pursued by the city. Notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why an enforcement action should not be pursued. The notice of the
meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether the user appears
as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued by the Superintendent
following the hearing. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against the user.
   (F)   Compliance orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this subchapter, wastewater
discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a reasonable amount of time designated in the order. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time allowed in the order, additional
enforcement action may result or sewer service may be discontinued. Compliance
orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other
action against the user.
   (G)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that a user is violating any
provision of this subchapter, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations by
revoking the user's wastewater discharge permit and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge;
         (c)   Stop illegal or authorized discharges immediately; and/or
         (d)   Terminate all discharge from user's facility.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to
taking any other action against the user.
   (H)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, any user
that is found to have violated any provision of this subchapter, its wastewater
discharge permit, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such
fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
      (2)   The Superintendent shall have such collection remedies as may be
available for other service charges and fees.
      (3)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after being due and
unpaid for 30 days, be assessed an additional penalty of 15% of the unpaid
balance and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A
lien against the individual user's property will be sought for unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties.
      (4)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Superintendent to reconsider the fine, and submit such with request of
full payment of the fine amount, within 15 days of being notified of the fine.
Where a request has merit, the Superintendent shall convene a hearing on the
matter within 120 days of receiving the request from the industrial user. In
the event the user's appeal is granted by the Superintendent, all or part of
the payment, together with all or part of any interest that has accrued and
been paid, shall be returned to the industrial user. The city may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to
the fine.
      (5)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
      (6)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against the user.
   (I)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   Following verbal notice to the user, the Superintendent may
immediately suspend a user's discharge whenever such suspension is necessary in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. Following written notice and an opportunity of the user to
respond, the Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge that
threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may
present an endangerment to the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to persons or the environment. The
Superintendent shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user
has demonstrated to the Superintendent's satisfaction that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in
division (J) of this section are initiated against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Superintendent, prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under divisions (E) and (J) of this
section.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (J)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to those provisions in §
51.076(F), any user that violates the following provisions of this subchapter,
wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to
discharge termination. The city may terminate wastewater disposal service and
disconnect an industrial user from the system when there is a:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling;
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards or pretreatment
requirements in §
51.073;
         (f)   Failure to pay monthly bills for water, sanitary sewer, and
industrial wastewater services when due;
         (g)   Discharge from the industrial user which, alone or in
combination with other discharges, causes the POTW to exceed its NPDES or TPDES
permits, or which causes damage or imbalance at the POTW; or
         (h)   Failure to fulfill the requirements of an order issued by the
city.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and may be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (E) of
this section why the proposed action should not be taken. The authority to
terminate an industrial user's discharge is available to the city regardless of
the industrial user's compliance status.
      (3)   The city will continue a disconnection from the POTW until such
time as the industrial user substantiates its compliance with this subchapter,
and/or provides additional pretreatment or other facilities designed to address
the requirements of any wastewater discharge permit or order issued by the
city, or any provision of this subchapter. When the city agrees to reconnect
the industrial user, the industrial user will pay all costs for reconnection
and file for a new wastewater discharge permit. No waste can be discharged from
the industrial user to the POTW until a new wastewater discharge permit is
issued.

§ 51.082 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this subchapter,
wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the Superintendent may petition a District Court of
Johnson County through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement
imposed by this subchapter on activities of the industrial user. Such other
action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by
the city. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite
to taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any user which has violated or continues to violate this
subchapter, any order of wastewater discharge permit hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum
civil penalty of $1,000 per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or
other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day
during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court may, in
addition to the criteria established in Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 54.017 take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, and corrective
actions taken by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other
factor as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this subchapter, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine no more than $2,000 per violation per day.
      (2)   Any user that willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine not more than
$2,000 per violation per day. This penalty shall be in addition to any other
cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state
law.
      (3)   Any user that knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
subchapter, wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers
with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required
under this subchapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
than $2,000 per violation per day.
      (4)   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a
fine of not more than $2,000 per violation per day.
   (D)   Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in §§
51.081 through
51.086 are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any,
all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the
city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city
is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user and these actions may be taken concurrently.

§ 51.083 SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (A)   Performance bonds. The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue
a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has in the past failed to
comply with the provisions of this subchapter, any orders, or a previous
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
   (B)   Liability insurance. The Superintendent may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has in the past failed
to comply with the provisions of this subchapter, any order, or a previous
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge or future discharges.
   (C)   Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this subchapter, any orders, or wastewater discharge
permits issued hereunder, water service to the user may be severed. Service
will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily
demonstrated its ability to comply with this subchapter.
   (D)   Public nuisances. Any violation of this subchapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public
nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Superintendent or
his or her designee. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject
to the provisions of Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Chapter 217, Subchapter C,
authorizing prohibition of such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for
any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.

§ 51.084 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Act of God. If an industrial user can establish that an event that
would otherwise be a violation of this subchapter, or a violation of a permit
issued pursuant to this subchapter, was caused solely by an act of God, war,
strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of this
subchapter or permit.
      (1)   Act of God defense.
         (a)   Act of God defense. The act of God defense constitutes a
statutory affirmative defense in an action brought in municipal or state court.
If a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of
a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under the ordinance, was caused
solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe, the event is
not a violation of the ordinance or permit.
         (b)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the act of God
affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through relevant evidence that:
            1.   An event that would otherwise be a violation of pretreatment
ordinance or a permit issued under the ordinance occurred, and the sole cause
of the event was an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe; and
            2.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW and the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event that would
otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under
the ordinance (if this information is provided orally, a written submission
must be provided within five days):
               a.   A description of the event, and the nature and cause of the
event;
               b.   The time period of the event, including exact dates and
times or, if still continuing, the anticipated time the event is expected to
continue; and
               c.   Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the event.
         (c)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial
user seeking to establish the act of God affirmative defense shall have the
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an event that would
otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under
the ordinance, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other
catastrophe.
   (B)   General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in §
51.073 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either a local limit exists for
each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each
local limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference
event, or that no local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its TPDES, NPDES, or TCEQ permit, and
in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   (a)   BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
         (b)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the presence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation and the
Superintendent is properly notified. These bypasses are not subject to the
provision of division (C)(3) and (4) of this section.
      (3)   (a)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the
date of the bypass or as soon as forseeable.
         (b)   An industrial user shall submit an oral notice of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass
has been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement
action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
division (C)(3) of this section.
         (b)   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) of this section.

   (C)   The assessment of drainage charges in Cleburne is based upon an

§ 52.023 MONTHLY DRAINAGE CHARGE.
   (A)   The following schedule of drainage charges is hereby established:
      (1)   Residential (0 - 0.5 acre) = $2.75 per month;
      (2)   Residential (0.5 - 1 acre) = $3.63 per month;
      (3)   Residential (over 1 acre) = $4.85 per month;
      (4)   Commercial (0 - 0.3 acre) = $3.19 per month;
      (5)   Commercial (0.3 - 0.5 acre) = $6.71 per month;

utility services afforded to the property. The drainage charges shall be
identified separately on the bill as "Drainage Utility Charge."
   (C)   The city shall not require a deposit for drainage charges as a
precondition to accepting surface flow into the city's drainage system.
Delinquent drainage charges are subject to the same penalties and methods of
collection as other utility charges for utility services provided by the city.
   (D)   The income of the drainage utility system shall be segregated and
completely identifiable in the accounts of the city pursuant to Tex. Local
Gov't Code § 402.049. The revenues produced by the drainage charges established
by this chapter shall be applied to the funding of operating requirements,
maintenance requirements, future system improvements and other capital costs,
and the development and implementation of a storm water management program by
the city.
   (E)   A user may apply to the City Manager or his or her designee for an
adjustment in the user's drainage charge if:
      (1)   The user demonstrates that the drainage charge schedule, as applied
to the user's benefitted property, does not fairly reflect the cost of service
to the user's benefitted property;
      (2)   The user demonstrates that the category of developed use or another
factor used in calculating the drainage charge for the user's benefitted
property is unfair; or
      (3)   The user demonstrates that the user's drainage charge has been
assessed in error.
   (F)   The City Manager or his or her designee shall adopt procedures to
ensure that applications for adjustments of drainage charges will be processed
and acted upon in a consistent and uniform manner, and may thereafter adjust
the drainage charge of a user who applies for an adjustment under division (E)
of this section and who meets the standards required therein.

§ 90.082 ZONES.
   In order to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, there are created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the
approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical surfaces as they apply to
Cleburne Regional Airport. Such zones are shown on Cleburne Regional Airport
Zoning Map prepared by Coffman Associates, and adopted by City Council on
December 13, 2022, which is attached to this subchapter and made a part hereof
by reference. A copy of the map shall be made available upon request at the
Cleburne Regional Airport administrative office. An area located in more than
one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:
   (A)   Approach zones. Approach zones are hereby established beneath the
approach surfaces at each end of Runway 15-33 at the airport. The approach
surface shall have an inner edge width of 500 feet, which coincides with the
width of the primary surface, at a distance of 200 feet beyond each runway end,
widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance
of 10,000 feet beyond the end of the primary surface. The centerline of the
approach surface is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   (B)   Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces. Transitional surface, symmetrically located on either
side of the runway, have variable widths as shown on the Cleburne Regional
Airport Hazard Zoning Map. Transitional surfaces extend outward perpendicular
to the runway centerline and the extended runway centerline from the periphery
of the primary surface and the approach surfaces to where they intersect the
horizontal surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach surface
projects through and beyond the conical surface, there are hereby established
transitional zones beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface and extending for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet as
measured perpendicular to the extended runway centerline.
   (C)   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established beneath the
horizontal surface at the airport which is a plane 150 feet above the
established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of the runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent
to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones.
   (D)   Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area beneath the
conical surface at the airport that commences at the periphery of the
horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of 4,000
feet.

created by this subchapter, to a height in excess of the applicable height
herein established for such zone, except as provided in this § 90.083. Such
applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in
question as follows:
   (A)   Approach zones. Slope one foot in height for each 34 feet in
horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a point 10,000 feet beyond the end of the
primary surface.
   (B)   Conical zone. Slopes one foot in height for each 20 feet in horizontal
distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet
above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the
airport elevation, or to a height of 1,204 feet above mean sea level.
   (C)   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation,
or at a height of 1,004.2 feet above mean sea level.
   (D)   Transitional zones. Slope one foot in height for each seven feet in
horizontal distance beginning at the sides of and at the same elevations as the
primary surface and the approach surfaces.

§ 90.084 LAND USE RESTRICTION.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, no use may be made
of land or water within any zone established by this subchapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create potential bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport.

be construed as to require the removal, lowering, or other change to any
existing nonconforming structure including all phases or elements of a
multiphase structure the construction of which was begun prior to the effective
date of these regulations and is diligently prosecuted.
   (C)   Nonconforming trees. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed
as to require the removal, lowering, or other change to any nonconforming tree.
However, any nonconforming tree which grows to a greater height than it was as
of the effective date of these regulations is subject to the provisions of
these regulations as described in §
90.083 above.
   (D)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding divisions (A) through (C) of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such

§ 90.086 PERMITS.
   (A)   Permits.
      (1)   Any person who desires to replace, rebuild, substantially change,
or repair a nonconforming structure or replace or replant a nonconforming tree
must apply for and receive a permit, and the permit shall be granted upon
affirmative demonstration by the applicant that the proposed construction,
repair, or tree conforms to the requirements of this subchapter. However, no
permit shall be granted which would allow the establishment of an airport
hazard or allow a nonconforming structure or tree to exceed its original height
or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was at the time of the
adoption of these regulations, except as provided for in §
90.086(D) below. Applications for permit shall be applied to and issued by the
City Manager or designee.
         (a)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain,
land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend
above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
         (b)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
         (c)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or
topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such
transition zones.
      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions set forth in
divisions (a) through (c) above shall be construed as permitting or intending
to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any
tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this subchapter
except as set forth in §
90.083(E) above.
   (B)   Existing structures. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming structure
or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the
effective date of this subchapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when
the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
   (C)   Nonconforming structure abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the City
Manager determines that a nonconforming tree has physically deteriorated, or
decayed, or a structure has been abandoned or more than 50% torn down or
damaged, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to
be rebuilt in such a way that it exceeds the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviates from the regulations of this subchapter.
   (D)   Variances.
      (1)   Any person desiring to erect, substantially change, or increase the
height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree so as to exceed the
height limitations set forth in this subchapter, or change the use of property
in such a way as to create a hazardous condition as described in §
90.084 above, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from such
regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration under 14 C.F.R. Part 77
as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.
      (2)   Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship, and that relief granted will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this
subchapter.
      (3)   Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of
this subchapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of
the application has been furnished to the City Manager or designee for advice
as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the City Manager or designee
does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Board of
Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
   (E)   Requirements and reasonable conditions. Any variance granted may, at
the discretion of the Board of Adjustment, impose any reasonable conditions as
may be necessary to accomplish the purpose of these regulations.
   (F)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate and
maintain the necessary markings and lights.

including the day of impoundment), after which, if the animal has not been
claimed by the owner and the proper fee paid as prescribed herein, the animal
shall be considered abandoned and the owner shall be divested of all ownership
and rights to the animal. The animal shall become the property of the city and
shall be subject to adoption, transfer to another shelter or animal rescue
organization, or humane euthanasia at the city’s sole discretion.
   (B)   If the owner of the impounded animal is known, as soon as practicable
after impoundment, immediate notice shall be given to such owner. Animals with
any type of traceable identification shall be kept for not less than ten days,

the shorter time period. If such animal is not redeemed within three days, and
after reasonable effort has been made to locate its owner, it shall be
considered abandoned and the owner shall be divested of all ownership and right
to the animal. After this time period, the animal shall become the property of
the city and may be placed for adoption subject to payment of the impoundment

including the day of impound, as set forth in §
91.037(B), all provisions of §
91.041 will apply and the animal will be sterilized prior to release.
   (D)   Due to the potential for contaminating the environment and causing
harm to scavenging animals, the carcass of any animal that has been humanely
euthanized with sodium pentobarbital or any other controlled substance will not
be released to any individual except as provided herein.
      (1)   Burial of animals that have been euthanized with sodium
pentobarbital is prohibited within the corporate city limits of Cleburne.

   If a complaint has been filed in city court against the owner of an
impounded animal for violation of this chapter, the animal shall not be
released except on the order of the court, which may also direct the owner to
pay any penalties for violation of this order in addition to all impoundment

that it represents a clear and present danger or nuisance to the citizens or
other animals in the community, order said animal to be euthanized in a humane

court, nor to the fees and fines which may result from a violation or
violations of this chapter.

and reinterments within all cemeteries:
   (A)   Written authorization from the owner of record of a space or his
designated representative, successor in interest or other proper legal
authority will be required before an interment or reinterment is allowed. In
certain cases, the city may require grave sites to be physically located by the
family or its representatives and authorization signed by the space owner or
legal representative of the space owner prior to opening the space for
interment, disinterment or reinterment. This gives the city the right to open
the grave space selected by the family.
   (B)   Proper authorization as required by the State of Texas or any public
authority having jurisdiction in the matter must be presented to the city at
the time an interment, disinterment or reinterment is effected. The city shall
not be liable for the accuracy of the data contained in said authorization or
for the identity of the person to be interred or disinterred.
   (C)   All interments, disinterments and reinterments shall be performed by a
licensed funeral director, the city employees or its contractors or other
persons as provided by state and local laws. In the event that a funeral home
or its contractor is in arrears for charges owed to the city for cemetery
services performed by the city or cemetery related fees and permits required of
the funeral home or its contractors, and these said charges remain unpaid for a
period of 30 days from the date services were rendered or fees or permits were
required, the city may prohibit the opening and closing of any other grave site
requested by such funeral home or its contractors until such time as the debt
is paid in full.
   (D)   Interment of human remains is allowed only in areas dedicated for
grave sites.
   (F)   The scattering of human cremation remains in any city owned cemetery
is not allowed.
   (G)   Contractor guidelines for work performed in cemeteries.
      (1)   Contractors shall contact cemetery clerk to locate interment
spaces, and the clerk will contact a staff representative to assist if
interment location is in question or not found.
      (2)   Cemetery clerk will take digital pictures of the interment area to
record any pre-existing damages prior to the contractor beginning gravesite
opening procedures. Additionally, the cemetery clerk will inspect the interment
area after closing operations to record any damage that may have been caused by
the contractor.
      (3)   In the event of inclement weather, the cemetery clerk at their
discretion may call in a staff representative to look at the site and recommend
an alternate digging procedure.
      (4)   Contractors shall place 3/4 inch sheets of plywood under the front
bucket and the outrigger arms of the backhoe during the excavation process to
reduce damage to cemetery grounds near the interment area.
      (5)   If the interment is not on the same day as gravesite opening
operations, the contractor must cover the open grave with three 3/4 inch sheets
of plywood and cover with a six-foot by eight-foot tarp to protect visitors of
the cemetery.
      (6)   During wet conditions, the contractor shall use plywood for
equipment to drive on so as not to create damage to streets or cause ruts.
      (7)   If ruts are created, the contractor shall repair the area as soon
as possible. If the repairs are not made within ten business days, the city
will make the repairs and bill the contractor for the cost of repairs. Failure
to repair damages may lead to the contractor being removed from the city’s
approved contractor list.
      (8)   Monuments that may hinder the digging operation will need to be
moved by the contractor by rolling the monument onto plywood to accommodate the
backhoe and dump truck. Two two-inch by six-inch boards should be laid on both
sides of the monument’s concrete slab, with two 3/4 inch sheets of plywood on
top to protect the slab. After digging has been completed, the monument shall
be rolled back into place until the service is over. The monument may need to
be rolled again to accommodate a burial vault if the funeral is not on the same
day that the gravesite is opened. After the closing duties are performed, the
monument will be placed in the original location and the contractor shall reset
it using a setting compound.
      (9)   If the contractor decides they do not need to roll the monument,
then the contractor shall use three 3/4 inch sheets of plywood placed under the
backhoe outrigger arms to increase the digging height advantage on monuments
three feet or more in height. Two 3/4 inch sheets of plywood shall be placed
under the backhoe outrigger arms to increase the digging height advantage on
monuments two feet or less in height.
      (10)   The contractor shall cover each monument in close proximity to the
interment site with a six-foot by eight-foot tarp to avoid hydraulic spill
damage during opening and closing procedures.
      (11)   Contractor shall maintain general liability insurance coverage of
at least $1,000,000 and automotive liability insurance of at least $1,000,000
with the city listed as an additional insured.
      (12)   All contractors shall be required to sign an acknowledgement that
they will abide by these rules and regulations, and obtain a contractor’s
registration permit. Permits are available at the cemetery office.

(Ord. 02-2000-18, passed 2-22-00)
§ 94.10 GREASE TRAPS.
   (A)   Applicability and minimum size.
      (1)   All food establishments must be equipped with a grease trap. A
plumbing permit must be obtained by a licensed plumber prior to installation of
a grease trap. Day care centers and churches with commercial kitchen operations
are included as food establishments.
      (2)   Grease traps shall be installed and sized in accordance with the
currently adopted plumbing code or the sizing chart adopted by Ordinance 04-
2022-39 or its successor ordinances, whichever requires a larger trap. The
chart must be updated by ordinance every five years to account for advances in
technology and changes in best practices based on a survey of benchmark cities.
      (3)   The applicant may request the use of a smaller trap according to
the following process:
         (a)   If the sizing chart requires a size that is larger than the
plumbing code, the Health Inspector may grant the use of a smaller trap sized
according to the plumbing code;
         (b)   If the plumbing code requires a size that is larger than the
sizing chart, the Building Official may grant the use of a smaller trap sized
according to the chart.
      (4)   Dishwashers and food waste grinders are not acceptable substitutes
for a grease trap and will not be permitted in lieu of a grease trap.
   (B)   Location of grease traps. Grease traps installed in food
establishments shall be located outside of the establishment unless approved in
writing by the Health Inspector, or authorized designee.
      (1)   A grease trap shall not be installed in any part of a building
where food is handled or stored. Grease traps shall be located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and where equipment or personnel servicing the trap
would not pass through food handling or storage areas.
      (2)   Wastewater sample ports must be located in an area with 24-hour
access, outside the building, after the grease trap and before co-mingling with
other wastewater.
   (C)   Exceptions.
      (1)   Roadside vendors, temporary food establishments, day care centers
and churches without a commercial kitchen, and concession stands are exempt
from the requirement of grease traps. The Health Inspector may grant other
exceptions based upon food operations.
      (2)   Mobile food vendors are required to have a central preparation
kitchen that complies with Texas Food Establishment Rules within the Texas
Administrative Code.
      (3)   Downtown. Within the downtown area as identified on the adopted
Future Land Use Map, the Building Official may issue a permit for an
alternative size and type of grease trap, including a trap that is located
inside a building, if the trap is certified in writing by a licensed engineer.
         (a)   Once the trap is installed, the trap must be operated per
manufacturer specifications. Manufacturer specifications must be provided to
the Health Inspector and retained on site for compliance verification of waste
removal schedule and health permit requirements.
         (b)   Oils, fats, and greases must be removed from the trap per
manufacturer specifications or as often as deemed necessary by the Health
Inspector to maintain sanitary conditions within the building and to prevent
such oils, fats, and greases from entering the city sewer system.
   (D)   Cleaning and sanitation. All areas surrounding treatment devices,
sample ports and holding tanks shall be kept clean and free of fats, oils and
grease, and other wastes that create odors or attract pests. Additionally,
these areas shall be maintained to facilitate immediate access for cleaning by
the user and inspection by the city at all times.
      (1)   Wastes shall not be spilled, splashed, allowed to overflow, or
otherwise placed on the area surrounding treatment devices.
      (2)   In the event wastes are spilled, splashed, allowed to overflow, or
otherwise placed on the area surrounding the treatment device, the owner or
operator of the business is responsible for cleaning all waste from the area
and ensuring that the waste is properly removed according to divisions (D) and
(E).
      (3)   A user shall not remove any inlet or outlet piping or otherwise
alter a treatment device in any way which may allow fats, oils and grease,
flammable wastes, sand or other objectionable wastes to pass through the
treatment device into the wastewater collection system.
      (4)   During cleaning activities, residues shall be removed from piping
and walls of the treatment devices. Additionally, the piping and walls of the
treatment device shall be inspected to assure the integrity of the device is
maintained.
   (E)   Waste removal schedule. All grease trap waste shall be pumped and
removed, and its tanks thoroughly cleaned at least once every three months.
      (1)   Any deviation from this schedule must be granted in writing from
the Health Inspector.
      (2)   The Health Inspector may require additional pumping, increase the
frequency of cleanings, or require immediate pumping of a grease trap if the
Health Inspector deems it necessary in order to prevent grease from entering
the city sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Treatment devices shall be maintained in an efficient operating
condition by the owner or operator at his or her expense and shall produce a
discharge that complies with this division, other divisions of this section and
Chapter 51.
      (4)   Any establishment who utilizes microorganisms in any grease trap
within the city will still be required to comply with the aforementioned
pumping schedule.
   (F)   Transportation. All grease waste must be transported by a grease waste
hauler licensed by TCEQ. The grease hauler is responsible for proper disposal
of grease waste in an approved permitted site. It is the responsibility of the
grease waste hauler to forward a copy of each waste trip ticket to the
regulatory authority.
   (G)   Enforcement remedies. If the property owner fails to maintain a grease
trap in a sanitary working condition or fails to comply with any other
provision or requirement of this section, the city may pursue any
administrative remedy at its disposal to protect the public health, including
discontinuance of water or electrical service, revocation of certificate of
occupancy, or issuance of an industrial user wastewater discharge permit with
stipulated regulatory compliance.
   (H)   Change of operation. If a property changes its use, or a use changes
its operations, such as adding or expanding a commercial kitchen, the city may
require that a grease trap be installed or that an existing trap be increased
in size. The Building Official may withhold issuing a certificate of occupancy

analogue, or drug if the person is arrested for any offense arising out of acts
alleged to have been committed while the person was operating or in actual
physical control of a moving vessel or manipulating water skis, an aquaplane,

giving of any other type of specimen to determine the person's alcohol
concentration, but the person is not deemed, solely on the basis of the
person's operation of a moving vessel or manipulating water skis, an aquaplane,
or a similar device, to have given consent to give any specimen other than a
specimen of the person's breath or blood. The specimen or specimens shall be
taken at the request of a peace officer having probable cause to believe the
person was operating or in actual physical control of a moving vessel or
manipulating water skis, an aquaplane, or a similar device while intoxicated.
   (I)   When a person gives a specimen of blood at the request or order of a
peace officer under this section, only a physician, qualified technician,
chemist, registered professional nurse, or licensed vocational nurse may

inspected periodically by the county in which the sample is taken or in a
physician's office or a hospital licensed by the Texas Department of Health.
This limitation does not apply to the taking of specimens of breath, urine, or
bodily substances other than blood. The person drawing the blood specimen at

to take the blood specimen as provided by this section, if the blood specimen
was withdrawn according to recognized medical procedures This division does not
relieve a person from liability for negligence in withdrawing a blood specimen.

to exceed two hours after the arrest, have a physician, qualified technician,
chemist, or registered professional nurse of the person's own choosing draw a
specimen and have an analysis made of the person's blood in addition to any
specimen taken and analyzed at the direction of a peace officer. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional specimen or analysis by a person does not
preclude the admission of evidence relating to the analysis of the specimen
taken at the direction of the peace officer under this section.
   (K)   On the request of a person who has given a specimen at the request of
a peace officer, full information concerning the analytical results of the test
or tests of the specimen shall be made available to the person or the person's
attorney.
   (L)   If for any reason the person's request to have a chemical test is
refused by the officer or any other person acting for or on behalf of the
state, that fact may be introduced into evidence at the person's trial.
   (M) If the person refuses a request by an officer to give a specimen of
breath or blood, whether the refusal is express or the result of an intentional
failure of the person to give the specimen, that fact may be introduced into
evidence at the person's trial.
   (N)   Before requesting a person to give a specimen, the officer shall
inform the person orally and in writing that if the person refuses to give the
specimen that refusal may be admissible in a subsequent prosecution. The
officer shall provide the person with a written statement containing this
information. If the person refuses the request of the officer to give a
specimen, the officer shall request the person to sign a statement that the
officer requested that the person give a specimen, that the person was informed
of the consequence of not giving a specimen, and that the person refused to
give a specimen.
   (O)   Except as provided by division (Q) of this section, if a person under
arrest refuses upon request of a peace officer to give a specimen designated by
the peace officer as provided by division (H), a specimen may not be taken.

rendering the person incapable of refusal, whether the person is arrested or
not, is deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by division (H) of
this section. If the person is dead, a specimen may be withdrawn by the county
medical examiner or the examiner's designated agent or, if there is no county
medical examiner for the county, by a licensed funeral director or a person
authorized as provided by division (I) of this section. If the person is not
dead but is incapable of refusal, a specimen may be withdrawn by a person
authorized as provided by division (I) of this section. Evidence of alcohol
concentration or the presence of a controlled substance, controlled substance
analogue, or drug obtained by an analysis authorized by this division is
admissible in a civil or criminal action.

      (1)   The officer arrests the person for an offense under Tex. Penal Code
§ 19.05(2)(a) or this section;
      (2)   The person is the operator of a vessel involved in an accident that

and/or the general public;
      (3)    That the conduct of the proposed activity, event or use is
reasonably likely to result in or create a clear and present danger of violence
to persons or property resulting in serious harm to the public;
      (4)    That the facility desired has already been reserved for another
activity, event or use at the same day and hour requested in the reservation

      (7)   (a)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.
            COMPETING SHOW. An event which has 35% or more of its net square
footage of exhibit space showing/selling product lines or businesses the same
or substantially similar to those in the client’s show. However, a show that is
open to the public shall not be deemed a competing show with a show open only
to the trade.
            PROTECTION CLAUSE. Center agrees that it will not lease any portion
of the facility to any competing show within the protection period.
         (b)   Protection clause. A protection clause may be granted by Center
to recurring consumer or trade shows that have a proven record of success in
the region, and which have produced significant local economic benefit. If
granted, the protection clause will offer protection 45 days on either side of
the show (protection period) from a competing show. The determination whether
or not an event is a competing show is solely within the discretion of the
Center Manager and shall be based upon the target audience, product lines and/
or business listings or prospects from both events. In the event a show’s
audience, product lines or businesses change and is then deemed to be a
competing show, the reservation will be in violation of the agreement and will
result in cancellation of this agreement and forfeiture of all payments made by
the client. No client may reserve the Center 45 days on either side of an event
that is substantially similar.
   (B)   The Cleburne Conference Center Manager may impose reasonable
conditions or restrictions on the granting of a reservation, including but not
limited to any of the following:
      (1)   Restrictions on fires, amplified sound, use of alcoholic beverages,
dancing, sports activities, use of animals, equipment or vehicle use, the
number of persons in attendance, the location of any bandstand or stage or any
other use which may appear likely to create a risk of harm to the use and
enjoyment of the Cleburne Conference Center and the senior citizens center.
      (2)    A requirement that the applicant post a reasonable deposit of
security for the repair of any damage to these facilities or the cost of clean-
up or both.
      (3)   A requirement that the applicant furnish adequate security forces
as determined by Conference Center Manager or Cleburne Police Chief or his
designee during the proposed use or activity. Cleburne Police Department Off-
Duty Security and Traffic Control Policy will apply.
      (4)    A requirement that the reserving party furnish additional sanitary
and/or refuse facilities that might be reasonably necessary, based on the use
or activity for which the reservation is being sought.
   (C)   Reservations shall not be transferrable without the written consent of
the Cleburne Conference Center Manager.
   (D)   Any aggrieved person who is denied a reservation shall have the right
to appeal, in writing, within five days to the City Manager, who shall consider
the request and either sustain or overrule the Cleburne Conference Center
Manager's decision.
   (E)    A reserving party shall be bound by all rules and regulations and all
applicable ordinances fully as though the same were inserted in his
reservation.
   (F)    The person or persons to whom the reservation is issued shall be
liable for any loss, damage or injury to any person or property whatsoever by
reason of the negligence of the person or persons to whom such reservation is
issued.
   (G)   The Community Services Division Director or the Cleburne Conference
Center Manager shall have the authority to revoke a reservation upon finding of
a violation of any rule, ordinance, state, federal or local law or upon the
violation of any condition or restriction under which the reservation was
issued.
   (H)    Reservations shall be made in person by the responsible person.
   (I)   If approved, it will be the applicant's responsibility to pick up the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 112.001 TITLE.
   This chapter may be known and cited as the Multi-Channel Service Providers
Regulatory Ordinance for the City of Cleburne, Texas.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.002 CONSTRUCTION; GOVERNING LAW; VENUE.
   This chapter shall be construed under and in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas and the City Charter and City Code to the extent that such
Charter and Codes are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution
and laws of the United States or the State of Texas. All obligations of the
parties hereunder are performable in Johnson County, Texas. In the event that
any proceeding is brought to enforce the terms of this chapter, the same shall
be brought in Johnson County.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.003 SCOPE.
   This chapter shall be effective within the geographical limits of the city,
including any areas subsequently annexed by the city.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.004 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   (A)   The Council recognizes the United States Congress' intent in approving
the Cable Acts of 1984 and 1992, being 47 USC 521 et seq. As such, the Council
reaffirms and adopts those principles and ideals as part of the city's intent
with respect to cable television and expands its intent (where applicable) to
cover all MCS providers.
   (B)   As expressed by Congress, and adopted by the Council, its intent is as
follows:
      (1)   Establish a local policy concerning communications and
technologies;
      (2)   Establish franchise procedures and standards which encourage the
growth and development of cable systems which assure that cable systems are
responsive to the needs and interests of the city;
      (3)   Establish guidelines for the exercise of local authority with
respect to the regulation of cable systems;
      (4)   Assure that cable communications provide, and are encouraged to
provide, the widest diversity of information and services to the public;
      (5)   Establish an orderly process for franchise renewal which protects
cable operators against unfair denials of renewal where an operator's past
performance and proposal for future performance meet the standards set by the
Cable Acts of 1984 and 1992, an applicable franchise, and this chapter;
      (6)   Promote competition in cable communications and minimize
unnecessary regulations that would impose an undue economic burden on cable
systems; and
      (7)   Regulate rates charged by Multi-Channel Service Providers for the
basic service tier if the Multi-Channel Service Provider is not subject to
effective competition.
   (C)   In addition to principles and ideals listed in subsection (B), the
Council also expresses that its intent covers the following:
      (1)   To create a set of regulations, standards, and procedures for MCS
providers;
      (2)   To create a comprehensive customer service and consumer protection
policy for MCS providers;
      (3)   To provide for access and inspection of an MCS provider's books and
records in order to monitor compliance of local, state, and federal laws, and
any franchise agreement (if one has been granted);
      (4)   To create a thorough construction and installation policy for an
MCS provider's system;
      (5)   To provide for health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
city in light of the MCS provider's construction, operation, and maintenance;
      (6)   To provide for emergency override capability, so that citizens of
the city may be warned of a potential, imminent, actual disaster or emergency
situation that exists in the area;
      (7)   To provide for the introduction and installation of safety alert
technology in order to notify both subscribers and non-subscribers of imminent
disaster emergencies;
      (8)   To create a thorough procedure for collecting and monitoring
franchise fees and alternative user charges;
      (9)   To create a viable alternative to franchise fees in case such fees,
or their collection, are ruled invalid, unenforceable, or unconstitutional;
      (10)    To create a thorough default and revocation procedure for
licensed and franchised MCS providers;
      (11)    To provide for continuity of services in the event of city
acquisition, abandonment, withdrawal, cessation of service, revocation,
termination, non-renewal, or expiration of an MCS provider;
      (12)    To create a performance review procedure in order to assist the
city in its periodic evaluation of a franchised MCS provider's performance; and
      (13)    To create procedures for the evaluation and grant of MCS provider
applications for authorization, the identification of multi-channel service
related to community needs, and the establishment and enforcement of rules and
regulations of MCS providers consistent with the identified needs of the
community.
   (D)   Further, the Council recognizes that with respect to cable operators,
the Council's power to adopt regulations is, in part, authorized under the
Cable Acts of 1984 and 1992, as well as the Council's police powers, due to the
potential for physical scarcity and public disruption when cable either
occupies or uses the public rights-of-way.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)

and is in conflict with an expressed right that is specifically noted in an
existing franchise agreement (but only for the term of the existing franchise).
This provision covers situations where an MCS provider known as a cable
operator seeks, and is granted, modification of an existing franchise agreement
under Section 625 of the CCPA, codified at 47 USC 545; or
      (3)   That the imposition of such provisions and/or requirements will
create such an undue economic hardship on an MCS provider so as to imperil or
eliminate an MCS provider's ability to provide multi-channel service to a
majority of current subscribers; or
      (4)   That one or more time frames listed in this chapter are either
impossible to meet, or impractical to meet in light of the MCS provider's
operational policy; or
      (5)   That the MCS provider has its own construction, maintenance,
operation, or customer service policy, which the Council/franchising authority
deems comparable to, or exceeding, any provision and/or requirement from which
the MCS provider seeks relief.
   (C)   The Council/franchising authority shall have the responsibility of
determining whether and MCS provider's construction, maintenance, operation, or
customer service policy is comparable to, or exceeds, a similar provision in

delegate investigative and reporting functions to an authorized representative
of the city.

MCS provider may submit a written request or petition for clarification on the
precise intent and effect that one or more provisions or sections of this
chapter has on the petitioning MCS provider.
   (E)   In accordance with this chapter, the Council/franchising authority may
charge the petitioning MCS provider with the actual costs for processing such a
petition, including any costs incurred by outside consultants who are retained
by the city to review an MCS provider's petition.
   (F)   In those instances where the Council/franchising authority grants an
exemption or relief to a franchised MCS provider, or deems a franchise MCS
provider's operational policy to be comparable to an chapter provision, then
the franchise agreement (initial, existing, or renewal) shall be amended within
30 days to reflect the exact extent of such exemption and/or relief. It should
be specifically noted that the benefit of such exemption, relief,
clarification, or comparable policy extends only to the MCS provider granted
such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy.

shall not only supersede the effect of the chapter, but also control in any
local application.

   (B)   In the case where a franchised MCS provider receives an exemption,
relief, clarification from one or more provisions or section of this chapter,
or has one or more of its policies deemed comparable to a provision contained
in this chapter, then the franchise agreement should specifically note such
exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy, and to the extent that
such an exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy is inconsistent
with a provision contained in this chapter, then the specifically noted
exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy language contained in
the franchise agreement shall control.

representing the insurance to the Council/franchising authority, and each
policy or certificate delivered shall be accompanied by evidence of payment of
the premium thereon.
   (I)   If the state permits an MCS provider to self-insure, then the MCS
provider may exercise its right to self-insure, so long as the minimal amounts
of insurance coverage outlined in this section are met and maintained for the
entire period of that the affected MCS provider is self-insured. However, for
the reasons listed in division (E) of this section, the Council/franchising
authority may make a formal determination and require an increase in the
minimal amounts of insurance coverage.

§ 112.019 PERFORMANCE AND CONSTRUCTION/COMPLETION BOND.
   (A)   An MCS provider shall furnish the Council/franchising authority, in an
amount totalling at least $100,000, a performance bond or security bond
executed by a surety licensed to business in this state. The purpose of the
performance bond is to ensure performance of any requirements imposed by this
chapter on an MCS provider. Further, the purpose is to guarantee that should
the MCS provider not fulfill any obligations imposed by this chapter (or where
applicable a franchise agreement), then the surety will make whole (to the
extent of the policy) any monetary losses incurred by the city.
   (B)   An MCS provider shall furnish to the Council/franchising authority a
construction/completion bond prior to the time it commences a construction,
upgrade, rebuild, or repair/maintenance project that has a capital construction
cost or outlay exceeding $50,000 in value. The amount of the bond shall equal
at least 90% of the projected capital construction cost or outlay. The
construction/completion bond shall remain in force at all times, unless relief
is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in an agreement between the
Council/franchising authority and the MCS provider.
   (C)   The construction/completion bond or security bond shall specifically
guarantee that an MCS provider will timely abide by its construction, upgrade,
rebuild, or repair/maintenance schedule for the multi-channel system and/or any
timetable for technical and service improvements or additions to the multi-
channel system as may be committed to, or agreed upon, from time to time, by
the Council/franchising authority and MCS provider.
   (D)   If the city draws on a performance or completion bond or cash deposit
as a result of an MCS provider's failure to timely discharge its obligations,
or failure to construct and activate the multi-channel system, or failure to
complete a multi-channel system upgrade or rebuild or repair/maintenance, then
the MCS provider shall be required, within 30 days to replenish the completion
and performance bond or security bond to the minimal level required by the
Council/franchising authority.
   (E)   Should the Council/franchising authority make a formal determination
that due to the MCS provider's past performance (such as a documented history
of repeated or multiple franchise violations), or increased cost (greater than
50% of the original estimated cost), or documented untimeliness, or
incompletion of projects listed in construction schedules, the Council/
franchising authority may raise the required amount of either the performance
or the construction/completion bond.
   (F)   The performance bond or security bond shall be in force at all times
unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in a written
agreement between the MCS provider and the Council/franchising authority.

§ 112.020 REPORTS AND RECORDS; POLICY.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that advances in
technology and the adoption and application of a multi-channel laws, rules,
regulations, and court decisions may have a profound effect and impact on an
MCS provider in any given year.
   (B)   Consequently, it is incumbent that the Council/franchising authority
take measures to reduce the risk that multi-channel service or the multi-
channel system will be adversely affected in any given year.
   (C)   Therefore, the evaluation of legal, technical, financial, and
character qualifications of an MCS provider is viewed as a constant undertaking
on the part of the city. As a result, the Council/franchising authority
requires that the operator maintain and retain all records and reports
necessary for the Council/franchising authority to determine compliance with
the obligations imposed on an MCS provider, and to determine the MCS provider's
legal, technical, financial, and character qualifications for the proceeding
four years.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.021 FURNISHING OF REPORTS.
   (A)   Within 90 days after this chapter becomes effective, and thereafter,
at least once every 12 months, an MCS provider shall submit a list to the
Council/franchising authority, or designee, of files, reports, records, data,
or other information that the MCS provider periodically files with the FCC, or
another federal or state agency. If the MCS files a non-periodic or non-regular
file with the FCC, or another federal or state agency, then the MCS shall,
within 60 days of that filing, notify the Council/franchising authority of such
federal or state filing. As part of a performance evaluation, or for any
legitimate matter related to the administration of an MCS provider (or if
applicable the MCS provider's franchise), the Council/franchising authority may
specifically request that it be provided with any or all listed reports,
records, data, or other information that were originally filed with the FCC, or
another federal or state agency. However, unless specifically authorized by the
state, an MCS provider shall not be required to provide to the Council/
franchising authority any state or federal tax returns, or any documents
(inclusive of all above-referenced categories) exempted under federal privacy
laws, including Section 631 of the CCPA, codified at 47 USC 551, as amended.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements noted in division (A) of this section,
an MCS provider shall timely submit those reports, statements, and logs
required by this chapter, including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A periodic gross revenue statement in the manner set forth in this
chapter;
      (2)   A periodic certification that answering of phones is meeting the
specifications listed in this chapter;
      (3)   Preventive maintenance reports in the manner set forth in this
chapter; and
      (4)   Any other reports or information required by another section of
this chapter, or by the Council/franchising authority which are necessary to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city.

§ 112.022 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   (A)   An MCS provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and
records of the business and operations under and in connection with the MCS
system.
   (B)   The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to review
(either by mail or at the MCS provider's local office) all records needed for
the administration enforcement of this chapter or any franchise on seven days
written notice. Such review, unless mutually agreed upon or judicially ordered
should occur within the MCS provider's regular office hours.
   (C)   The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to hire, at its
own expense, an independent certified public accountant or other business or
financial expert to review the books and records of an MCS provider. If after a
financial audit it is determined that the MCS provider has under paid amounts
owed to the city (in excess of 2%), then the city may require the MCS provider
to reimburse the city for the actual cost of the audit. Note well, however,
that absent fraud, all audits shall be binding on the city.
   (D)   A false entry into the books and/or records of an MCS provider made by
an MCS provider of a material and substantial fact shall constitute a material
violation of this chapter. However, an erroneous entry, made in good faith,
shall not constitute a material violation of this chapter.
   (E)   An MCS provider at the local office shall keep complete and accurate
books and records of the key aspects of the multi-channel system's operation
for at least the preceding four years in such a manner that all matters
pertaining to the city can be easily produced and/or verified at the city's
request. Also, the MCS provider shall keep at its local office and shall make
available and provide upon request any other applicable records and information
that may be required by any other federal or state agency having jurisdiction
over MCS providers.

§ 112.023 CONTINUED USE OF INDIVIDUAL ANTENNAS PROTECTED.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority does not intend to prohibit the
erection or continued use of individual television antennas within the city so
long as the individual television antennas conform to any and all applicable
zoning and/or land use regulations. Consequently, no person shall be required
to receive multi-channel service, or to physically connect to a multi-channel
system.
   (B)   It is also noted that no person shall be penalized or fined (through
either a home sales contract, deed of restrictive covenants, or other type of
agreement) for failing or refusing to receive multi-channel service, or
physically connecting to a multi-channel system.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.024 ALERTING SUBSCRIBERS IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY; STANDBY POWER.
   (A)   In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending,
imminent or actual, natural or man-made emergency, then all MCS providers shall
ensure that the multi-channel system providing multi-channel service to all or
part of the city is designed so as to permit an authorized official of the city
to override the audio portion of all channels, by touch-tone phone (or
functional equivalent) from any location.
   (B)   In addition to any other requirements listed in this section, and MCS
provider shall:
      (1)   Designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of
both audio and video. This channel need not be solely use for emergency
broadcasts, and may in fact be used for any lawful purpose;
      (2)   Inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel on a
periodic basis (not less than twice a month);
      (3)   Maintain all channel video blanking capability to facilitate the
needs of hearing and sight-impaired customers;
      (4)   Test the emergency override system not less than once a month;
      (5)   Cooperate with the city on the use and operation of the emergency
alert override system; and
      (6)   Develop a plan (with the city's concurrence) in order to provide
continuity of multi-channel service, and response to service calls in the event
of a natural or man-made emergency.
   (C)   As one method of providing continuity of multi-channel services in the
event of a natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider shall, unless
exempted by the Council/franchising authority, have the capacity for two-hour
automatically activated standby power on all trunk and feeder cable, and all
headends, hubs, and reception sites associated with the distribution of service
to and throughout the city. The capacity shall automatically be increased when
technologically feasible.

§ 112.025 SAFETY ALERT TECHNOLOGY.
   (A)   The city may require an MCS provider, as a means of protecting the
health, safety and welfare of the public and of communicating with the public,
who utilizes a means of transmission that allows such, to provide a technology
or service that:
      (1)   Provides effectively instantaneous access into potentially every
home, regardless of whether or not one subscribes to basic cable service;
      (2)   Does not require that the television be turned on, or the volume
turned up to receive the message;
      (3)   Does not require that the resident be home at the time of
transmission to receive the message;
      (4)   Covers the entire range of human hearing;
      (5)   Stores the message in case no one is home at the time;
      (6)   Has an emergency audio alert intended to awaken a sleeping
individual;
      (7)   Can notify any one, or combination of discreet segments of the
population, without unnecessarily alarming the rest of the populace;
      (8)   Provides a different alert notification for emergency and non-
emergency situations;
      (9)   Is tied directly into the local office of the National Weather
Service's Site Selection weather warning service and standard weather radio
service.
   (B)   In the event the city chooses not to require the provision of the
technology or service, the MCS provider shall reserve the bandwidth necessary
for the provision of the service for use by any third party designated or
approved by the city/franchising authority.
   (C)   The city/franchising authority designates the necessary bandwidth as a
form of Governmental Access and as such may require the provision of the
necessary bandwidth at no charge.
   (D)   The city/franchising authority requires the MCS provider the necessary
bandwidth to fully and completely cooperate with the city/franchising
authority, and any third party provider of the service, in all matters related
to the provision of the service, including but not limited to:
      (1)   Making the public aware of the availability of the service;
      (2)   Educating the public as to the benefits, value and use of the
service;
      (3)   The distribution and installation of any in-home device(s) needed
for the reception and use of the service;

(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.026 PROVIDING BROAD CATEGORIES OF VIDEO PROGRAMMING; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 624 of
the CCPA, codified at 47 USC 544, the legal power of local government is
severely restricted in requiring and/or demanding that particular video
programming or other services be provided to subscribers over the multi-channel
system.
   (B)   Nevertheless, the Council/franchising authority recognizes that it
should strive to ensure that its citizens receive the widest and most diverse
selection of video programming possible. Consequently, for those MCS providers
required to maintain a franchise, the Council/franchising authority states as
its objective to such franchised MCS providers that the provision of video
programming to subscribers should include the following broad categories:
      (1)   Local broadcast stations;
      (2)   Two distant carriage signals or satellite-fed broadcast stations;
      (3)   PEG programming on the lowest offered and/or available tier;
      (4)   Sports programming services (regional and/or national);
      (5)   News, information, or public affairs/interest programming services;
      (6)   Financial/consumer-oriented programming services;
      (7)   Scientific and/or cultural programming services;
      (8)   Children's programming services; and
      (9)   Ethnically sensitive programming services.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.027 PROVIDING SEAMLESS OR SEE-THROUGH TECHNOLOGY; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority recognizes the fact that it is in
the public's interest to be able to utilize the functions inherent in
subscriber receiving equipment without having to incur additional costs to
obtain the same functions.
   (B)   Consequently, the Council/franchising authority may require that,
unless a franchised MCS provider can demonstrate to the city that it is
technically or economically unfeasible or commercially impracticable, then such
MCS provider shall provide the ability to utilize the functions inherent in
subscriber equipment in a seamless or see-through manner which allows:
      (1)   The use of any built-in remote control capability of a subscriber's
television for the control of any and all television channels provided by the
franchised MCS provider without the use or necessity of additional equipment;
and
      (2)   The ability to record video programming on any channel provided by
the MCS provider while watching programming on any different channel without
the use or necessity of any additional in-home equipment other than the
television receiver/monitor and a recorder.

§ 112.028 TAMPERING; UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION OF CERTAIN SERVICES.
   (A)   Consistent with Section 633 of the CCPA, codified at 47 USC 553, no
person shall intercept or receive, or assist in intercepting or receiving any
communications service offered over a multi-channel system unless specifically
authorized to do so by an MCS provider, or as may otherwise be specifically
authorized by law.
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, the term ASSIST IN INTERCEPTING OR
RECEIVING shall include the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended
by the manufacturer or distributor (as the case may be) for the unauthorized
reception of multi-channel service as noted in division (A) of this section.
   (C)   Without securing permission from an MCS provider, or making payment to
an MCS provider, then no person shall be authorized to make any connection,
whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with
any part of an authorized or franchised multi-channel system for purpose of
receiving or intercepting, or assisting other to receive or intercept any cable
service provided lawfully by the MCS provider.
   (D)   No person shall be authorized to willfully tamper with, remove or
damage any cable, wires, equipment or facilities used for the distribution of
multi-channel services.
   (E)   Any and all MCS providers are encouraged to work with the Council/
franchising authority in developing and implementing a plan designed to control
and eliminate the unauthorized reception of certain cable services within the
city.

NOTIFICATION OF SERVICES; BILLING
§ 112.045 NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES; POLICY.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that it is critical that
a customer of an MCS provider fully understands and realizes the rights and
responsibilities of both the customer and MCS provider with respect to the
provision, maintenance, and repair of multi-channel service.
   (B)   Further, the Council/franchising authority believes that if sufficient
information is provided to a customer on certain customer service practices
such as rates, billing periods, number and types of services provided, and
rules concerning equipment use and return, then that customer will have the
information necessary to make an informed decision on what, if any, multi-
channel services to subscribe to and receive.
   (C)   In order to provide customers with the variety of information needed
to make an informed decision, and to ensure that customers are notified of
their and the MCS provider's rights and responsibilities with respect to the
multi-channel system, an MCS provider must provide a customer with a written
Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and Responsibilities with
Respect to the Provision of Multi-Channel Service.
   (D)   The Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and
Responsibilities with Respect to the Provision of Multi-Channel Service shall
be provided at the time of initial installation. Thereafter, a subscriber shall
be provided with a written Notice at least once every 12 months. If, however,
an MCS provider amends, repeals, adds, deletes, modifies, or makes other
changes to any customer service practice that is required in this chapter, then
the MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with such written notification at
least 30 days prior to the effective date of such amendment, repeal, addition,
deletion, modification, or other change.
   (E)   Unless expressly prohibited by the state, an MCS provider may comply
with the notice requirements by providing the notice over the MCS system, on a
channel clearly designated for the dissemination of such information. Such a
channel need not be solely designated for dissemination of such information,
and may, in fact, be used at other times for any lawful purpose.

   (C)   Existing subscribers shall be informed of the items listed in division
(A) of this section at least once every 12 months.
   (D)   Whenever there is a change in an MCS provider's billing practices or

days before such billing practices or payment requirements become effective.
   (E)   In any case where a subscriber requests a cancellation or reduction of

§ 112.048 BILLING CREDIT FOR SERVICE OUTAGES; INTERRUPTIONS; SUBSTANDARD SIGNAL
OR PICTURE QUALITY OR UNSOLICITED SERVICE.
   (A)   An MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with a pro rata credit for
service outage exceeding eight hours in duration.
   (B)   Where not expressly prohibited by the state, the Council/franchising
authority may prescribe rules for giving credit to a subscriber in cases of
substandard signal or picture quality.
   (C)   In the case of a charge for unsolicited service, an MCS provider shall
provide a subscriber with an adjustment or billing credit on the next available
billing statement. Moreover, in such a case, an MCS provider shall not consider
a subscriber delinquent for failure to pay a charge for unsolicited service.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.049 PROHIBITION AGAINST NEGATIVE OPTION PROMOTIONAL PACKAGE.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority both recognizes and determines that
as a matter of consumer protection, a subscriber should be charged only for
those services that such subscriber has affirmatively and specifically
requested. Therefore, an MCS provider may not bill or invoice any subscriber
for any multi-channel service that is not affirmatively requested by the
subscriber by name.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, a subscriber's affirmative request need
not be in writing, but an MCS provider relying on an oral request must keep an
accurate, precise, and exact record of the date, and time the request was made
and the CSR or service technician to whom the request was made.
   (C)   For purposes of this section, a subscribers shall be deemed to have
affirmatively requested a multi-channel service if:
      (1)   The subscriber voluntarily makes payment for the multi-channel
service after an initial free trial period; and
      (2)   There was included in the notice or advertising material describing
the service a statement clearly advising the subscriber that such subscriber
has incurred no obligation to pay for such service, and that such subscriber
need not take any action to avoid incurring any such obligation.
   (D)   Moreover, an MCS provider may not automatically enroll a subscriber
into a different class or tier of multi-channel service without first
informing, at least 30 days in advance, such subscriber of any and all costs
associated with such a different call or tier of multi-channel service.
   (E)   Additionally, an MCS provider may not invoice a subscriber for
disconnecting or downgrading from a negatively promoted or automatically
enrolled class or tier or multi-channel service.
   (F)   Should a subscriber be charged for a multi-channel service in
violation of this section, then the MCS provider shall provide a subscriber
with an adjustment or billing credit on the next available billing statement.
Moreover, in such case, an MCS provider shall not consider a subscriber
delinquent for failure to pay a charge for a non-affirmatively requested multi-
channel service.
   (G)   This provision, however, shall not preclude the addition or deletion
of a specific program from a service offering, the addition or deletion of
specific channels from an existing tier of service, or the restructuring or
division of existing tiers of service that do not result in a fundamental
change in the nature of an existing service or tier of service, provided that
such change is otherwise consistent with applicable regulations.

§ 112.050 SALES SOLICITATIONS; SPECIAL RULES.
   (A)   For MCS providers engaged in sales solicitations via phone, cellular
phone, interactive multi-channel system, PCN, or other type of personal
communications system, the following rules apply (unless preempted by federal
or state law):
      (1)   Sales solicitors identify themselves as sales solicitors at the
outset of the communication by saying, “I am a sale solicitor.”;
      (2)   Sales solicitors must not engage in bait-and-switch tactics, that
is they must not initially offer a lower priced service only to inform the
customer of its unavailability, or offer the lower priced service in order to
pressure sale a higher priced service; and
      (3)   Sales solicitors must quote the full and complete cost for any
service sold or subscribed to during the course of the communication.
   (B)   The restrictions outlined in division (A) of this section shall not

circumstances:
      (1)   In response to a customer's specific request;
      (2)   In connection with a charitable contribution or charitable purpose
for which 90% of the proceeds are delivered to a bona fide charitable
organization recognized as such by Internal Revenue Service Regulations;
   (C)   This restriction outlined in division (A) of this section shall not
apply to sales solicitations via printed material in that such printed
solicitations or advertisements are deemed not as disruptive or intrusive as
solicitations noted in division (A) of this section.

§ 112.051 MENU-DRIVEN SYSTEMS, SERVICE CLUSTERS, AND PACKAGING OF SERVICE
TIERS; SPECIAL RULES.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that the concept of menu-
driven program/service selection has both positive and negative aspects. On the
one hand, menu-driven program/service selection allows the greatest flexibility
for a subscriber in that it permits the subscriber to essentially create a
program/service package tailored to the subscriber's budget, viewing habits,
and informational needs. On the other hand, menu-driven program/service
selection is susceptible to unauthorized or unknowing purchases, and uninformed
program choices if certain procedural and operational safeguards are not
maintained.
   (B)   Should an MCS provider implement and/or offer menu-driven program/
service selection for all,or the majority of the MCS provider's multi-channel
services, then the Council/franchising authority reserves the power to adopt
additional rules and regulations (subject to the conditions listed in division
(C) of this section) concerning the following potential problem areas:
      (1)   Notification to the subscriber on a periodic (at least monthly)
basis of the exact costs for each menu-driven program/service, including any
installation or equipment rental charges;
      (2)   Notification of what constitutes, or what is required for selection
or subscription to a particular program/service;
      (3)   Limitations or prohibitions on negative option marketing plans when
done in connection with a menu-driven system unless the subscriber is initially
is informed, consents (in writing), and periodically (at least semi-annually)
renews the consent to be included on a list of potential subscribers; and
      (4)   Restricting access to menu-driven program/service selection by
subscribers through the use of individual, non-duplicative access codes or some
other means, in order to limit unauthorized purchases, or purchases above a
certain pre-set amount (without additional written approval).
   (C)   If, at the time an MCS provider implements and/or offer menu-driven
program/service selection, such MCS provider also adopts an operational policy
which protects subscribers from those potential problem areas listed in
division (B) of this section, then the Council/franchising authority shall not
exercise its additional regulatory authority on this subject, unless there is
documentation that the adopted policy of the MCS is not being enforced, or is
ineffective in safeguarding subscribers from the potential abuses listed above.
   (D)   As for service clusters, and the packaging of service tiers, and to
provide both a disincentive for bait and switch tactics, and to promote cluster
and tier stability, an MCS provider may not switch any particular multi-channel
service from one tier or cluster to another without 60 days notice; provided,
however, that upon 60 days prior notice, an MCS provider may rearrange, retier,
recluster, or otherwise offer its multi-channel service in a manner consistent
with FCC regulations.
   (E)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as mandating any
particular programming choice being provided to a subscriber. Nor should this
section be construed as requiring any particular program, service, cluster or
tier. Rather, this section is designed to promote cluster and tier stability so
that a subscriber may choose a program, service, cluster, or tier that best
suits the subscriber's individual programming and informational needs.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.052 DISCONNECTION FOR NON-PAYMENT.
   (A)   A subscriber shall not be considered delinquent in payment until at
least 45 days after the posting of the bill to the subscriber, and payment has
not been received by an MCS provider.
   (B)   Before disconnection of a subscriber's multi-channel service (either
physically or electronically) takes place, the following must occur:
      (1)   The subscriber must in fact be delinquent in payment of a multi-
channel service; and
      (2)   At least five days have elapsed after a separate written notice of
impending disconnection has been personally served upon the subscriber; or
      (3)   At least eight days have elapsed after mailing a separate written
notice of impending disconnection to the subscriber; or
      (4)   At least five days have elapsed after the subscriber has either
signed for or refused to accept a separate written notice of impending
disconnection.
   (C)   The written notice of disconnection must expressly and clearly state
the amount that is owed by the subscriber to an MCS provider, the minimum
amount required to be paid to avoid disconnection, and the date and place
within the city where such payment must be made.
   (D)   Disconnection of service must occur both on a normal service day and
within normal business hours of an MCS provider, unless the subscriber is given
the opportunity to pay the full amount of the past due amount.
   (E)   An MCS provider who physically retrieves its equipment, including
converter, remote control unit, or digital audio tuner, from a subscriber, must
do so within both a normal service day and normal service hours of an MCS
provider.
   (F)   Receipt of a bad check from a subscriber, in response to a written
notice of disconnection, does not constitute payment, and the affected MCS
provider need not give the subscriber further notice prior to disconnecting
multi-channel service.
   (G)   An MCS provider may add a reasonable collection charge to the
subscriber's bill if the applicable provisions of this chapter and any
applicable state or federal regulations are followed.
   (H)   Any refund due a subscriber after such a disconnection shall be made
within 60 days of the disconnection for non-payment.

Penalty, see § 112.999
§ 112.053 VOLUNTARY CUSTOMER CHANGES.
   (A)   This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers,
service cluster, menu-driven program/service, pay channel, premium channel,
informational service, entire multi-channel service or equipment provided to
the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after initial
service installation.
   (B)   The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely by
coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall
be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs. The actual cost charge shall
be either the HSC, as defined in §
112.146, multiplied by the number of person hours need to implement the change,
or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in
implementing customer changes.
   (C)   The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that
involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly simple method
shall be based on actual cost.
   (D)   A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected
solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple
methods, subject to written approval by the city, for a subscriber changing
service tiers more than two times in a 12 month period, except for such changes
ordered in response to a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system
adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers
in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers
more than the specified number of times in any 12 month period.
     (E)   Downgrade charges that are the same as or lower than upgrade charges
are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges.
   (F)   For 30 days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a customer
may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge.
   (G)   From the date that such a subscriber makes such a request for either a
disconnect or downgrade, then the MCS provider shall have two days or 48
service hours, whichever is longer, to disconnect or downgrade the service
tier, pay channel, premium channel, informational service, or entire multi-
channel service. In the event that an MCS provider does not disconnect or
downgrade service within 48 hours, a subscriber's obligation to pay for such
service shall cease, or in the case of a downgrade, a subscriber's obligation
to pay for the more comprehensive and/or higher priced service shall cease.
   (H)   For a service tier, service cluster, menu-driven service, premium
channel or informational service which is voluntarily disconnected, a
subscriber shall pay a pro rata share of the monthly rate for such service
tier, service cluster, menu-driven service premium channel or informational
service.
   (I)   Once a valid connection to a menu-driven program or a pay-per-view
event occurs, then the MCS provider may collect the full advertised or quoted
rate should the customer then attempt to disconnect the menu-driven program or
pay-per-view.
   (J)   If, however, an MCS provider's equipment is or has been damaged by a
subscriber prior to such disconnection, then the MCS provider may charge the
subscriber with the entire cost for such damage, provided that the MCS provider
notifies the subscriber within 10 days of the disconnection. A subscriber shall
not be required to pay for equipment failure, if the circumstances fall within
the normal wear and tear guidelines established in this chapter.
   (K)   Any refund due a subscriber after voluntary disconnection shall be
made within 45 days after such disconnection. This division specifically
includes the situation where a subscriber voluntarily disconnects service but
is entitled to a refund as a result of a service outage that exceeds eight
hours in duration. In such case a subscriber will also receive any refund due
as a result of the service outage within 45 days after the voluntary
disconnection.
   (L)   In no event will this section be viewed as abridging the rights and
remedies afforded by the subscriber complaint/inquiry resolution process
outlined in this chapter.

CUSTOMER SERVICES; EQUIPMENT
§ 112.070 CUSTOMER SERVICE HOURS; CAPABILITIES OF CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICE;
TELEPHONE.
   (A)   In order to facilitate the needs of the local customers, and MCS
provider shall maintain a fully operational, full service customer service
office which is both within the city, and easily accessible to customers. No
change in location shall be made without the express written approval of the
Council/approving authority.
   (B)   The customer service office shall be open at least 50 hours per week
(exclusive of holidays).
   (C)   Within the 50 hours per week that a customer service office must be

(after 5:00 p.m.), or on Saturdays and/or Sundays (if not prohibited by state
law). The office must remain open and fully operational from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. daily, Monday through Friday.
   (D)   The customer service office should have an adequate and knowledgeable
staff in order to handle the vast majority of customer services inquiries,
specifically including, but not limited to, billing inquiries, refunds, service
outages, equipment service and repair, payment of bills and other charges.
   (E)   An MCS provider may install at its customer service office an after
hours depository in order to collect invoice payments and receive requests for
service appointments (including connections, and disconnections) after
scheduled office hours.
   (F)   An MCS provider may install an automated (audio, or video) customer
assistance device or machine which can handle various types of customer
inquiries, but such automated device shall be provided in addition to personal,
live service outlined in this section.
   (G)   Neither the presence of an after hours depository or automated
customer service device relieves an MCS provider from maintaining the minimal
required number of office hours, or adequate CSR staff to handle the majority
of service inquiries.
   (H)   At least annually, any non-exempt MCS provider shall certify to the
Council/franchising authority that each customer service representative (CSR)
has taken and passed and MCS provider-implemented course designed to trains
CSRs to handle their jobs in a courteous, efficient, and responsive manner.
   (I)   An MCS provider shall maintain at least one toll-free and/or local
telephone number to accommodate normal business inquiries.
   (J)   An MCS provider shall maintain a separate 24 hour toll-free or local
telephone number to facilitate calls concerning repair of equipment and
extended interruption of service. During any hours that the customer service
office is open, the MCS provider must have or make available in-house personnel
to address a customer's inquiries. During other hours, a telephone may be
manned by an automatic answering device, provided that the use of an answering
device or answering service still results in an initial phone call by the MCS
provider within 60 minutes, in order to at least determine the extent of the
outage. The MCS provider shall not be required to make in-person telephone
contacts to subscribers at a rate which exceeds 60 calls per hour, and shall
not be required to make such calls between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00
a.m.
   (K)   A non-exempt MCS provider shall have adequate staff and/or extension
lines in order to handle calls to the general information number to the
following specifications:
      (1)   90% of all customer calls received in a year shall be answered
within three minutes by a representative of the MCS provider, or by a device
that is capable of complaint/inquiry resolution; and
      (2)   The rate of abandoned calls shall be less than 5% over a year's
period of time. Abandoned calls shall in no event be deemed to include calls in
which the caller hangs up within 45 seconds of making the call.
   (L)   With respect to the specifications listed in division (K) of this
section, it shall be the MCS provider's responsibility to certify monthly to
the Council/franchising authority that the affected MCS provider is meeting the
minimal specifications.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.071 PREFERENTIAL OR DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES PROHIBITED.
   (A)   An MCS provider shall not, as to rules, regulations, rates, charges,
provision of service, or use of a provider's facilities and equipment, make,
allow, or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person, nor subject
any person to prejudice or disadvantage on the basis of age, race, creed,
color, sex, national origin, handicap, religious affiliation or location of
residence.
   (B)   Consistent with Section 621(a)(3) of the CCPA, codified at 47 USC 541
(a)(3), MCS providers shall not deny cable service or the extension of cable
service to any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the
income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.
   (C)   Division (A) of this section, however, does not prohibit an MCS
provider from offering a promotional or incentive discount rate or charge as
long as the rate or charge does not exceed 370 days in length. This subsection
does not prohibit an MCS provider from offering special incentive rates such as
one month basic service free, if 12 months of basic service are paid in one
payment, or within a certain time frame.
    (D)   Division (A) of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from denying service based on location of residence if that residence is
outside the parameters for line extension as detailed in a franchise agreement
(if applicable).
   (E)   Division (A) of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from denying service to a subscriber who is more than 30 days delinquent in the
payment of any periodic service or special service bill so long as the
requirements for disconnection (as outlined in this chapter) have been
satisfied.
   (F)   Division (A) of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from implementing a carefully designed no-frills service tier or service
cluster for lower income and/or fixed income individuals.
   (G)   Division (A) of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from making agreements or entering into multi-channel service agreements with
multiple dwelling unit owners (including hotel, motel, and mobile park owners)
to provide multi-channel service under a bulk billing or other type of
arrangement.

§ 112.072 USE AND RETURN OF EQUIPMENT; SECURITY DEPOSITS AND THEIR RETURN.
   (A)   Prior to formally delivering any equipment, including auxiliary
equipment (such as a conver-ter, input selector switch, or video control
recorder) to a customer, an MCS provider shall have tested a representative
sample (at least 1%) of such equipment to ensure that it is in proper working
order.
   (B)   If needed for proper operation, or requested by a customer, an MCS
provider shall deliver to a customer handwritten or typed instructions
detailing the proper use of rented, loaned, or purchased equipment. Unless
required by another section of this chapter, an MCS provider may comply with
this section by delivering the manufacturer's instructions to a customer.
   (C)   An MCS provider is not required to seek a security deposit from a
customer for use or rental of the MCS provider's equipment.
   (D)   An MCS provider shall comply with any and all applicable rules
concerning the imposition, retention, and return of security deposits.
   (E)   Unless prohibited by other applicable law, the security deposit for a
particular piece of equipment, then the MCS provider shall be prohibited from
charging any security deposit for equipment which exceeds the replacement cost
to the MCS provider.
   (F)   As a matter of consumer protection, an MCS provider shall be
prohibited from charging any security deposit for multi-channel service which
exceeds twice the basic monthly rate.
   (G)   An MCS provider may charge an appropriate security deposit (consistent
with division (F) of this section) in those instances where a customer is
reconnected after an involuntary disconnection for nonpayment or prior history
of unsatisfactory payment.
   (H)   An MCS provider shall return a security deposit (together with any
interest earned) after the equipment is satisfactorily returned, or the
subscriber maintains a satisfactory payment history (which is determined as no
payment delinquencies within the preceding 12 month period).
   (I)   A customer shall maintain any equipment rented or leased from an MCS
provider in good working order, and operate such equipment only in the manner
specified by the MCS provider or manufacturer of the equipment.
   (J)   A customer shall totally and fully reimburse an MCS provider for any
damage or loss of their equipment that is due to the customer's failure to
properly maintain and operate such equipment.
   (K)   A customer shall be relieved from any responsibility for reimbursing
an MCS provider for equipment which malfunctions or does not operate due to a
hidden or latent defect in the equipment, or for equipment which fails to
operate, or improperly operates due to natural occurrences conditioned by the
normal wear and tear of such equipment, or for equipment damaged or destroyed
by an act of nature, and which is not covered by a customer's home or apartment
insurance policy.

§ 112.073 SERVICE INQUIRY LOGS.
   (A)   An MCS provider shall be required to keep and maintain service inquiry
logs, subject to any limitations imposed by state or federal law, including
(for MCS providers classified as cable operators) any subscriber privacy
limitations imposed by state, federal or local law.
   (B)   The purpose of the service inquiry logs is to assist the city in
assessing (in the aggregate) the type, degree, and resolution of customer
service requests, inquiries, and complaints.
   (C)   At a minimum, the service inquiry logs should contain the following:
      (1)   The time and date of initial receipt of any service request,
inquiry, or complaint, together with the time and date of initial response to
that service request, inquiry or complaint;
      (2)   The nature of the service request, inquiry, or complaint;
      (3)   The precise action taken by an MCS provider in order to resolve the
service inquiry, request, or complaint;
      (4)   Whether the service request, inquiry, or complaint was resolved by
allowing a credit or refund of some sort; and
      (5)   The area, location, or quadrant of the city where the service
request, inquiry, or request was generated.
   (D)   In addition to any other right of inspection that the Council/
franchising authority may possess, it shall have the right to review and
inspect a compilation of such logs. However, the Council/franchising authority
shall not have the right of access, review, or inspection for any service
inquiry logs or any information contained within service inquiry logs that are
otherwise protected from access, review, or inspection by state or federal law.
   (E)   This section does not require MCS providers to maintain service
inquiry logs on scheduled installations.

   (A)   At any time an MCS provider, in furtherance of its right to construct,
operate, and maintain a multi-channel system, disturbs the yard, residence, or
other real or personal property of a subscriber, such MCS provider shall ensure
that the subscriber's yard, residence, or other personal property is returned,
replaced, and/or restored to a condition that is sufficiently comparable to the
condition that existed prior to the commencement of the work.
   (B)   The costs associated with both the disturbance and the return,
replacement, and/or restoration shall be borne by the MCS provider. This
division also requires the MCS provider to reimburse a subscriber or private
property owner for any damage caused by the MCS provider, its subcontractor, or
its independent contractor, in connection with the disturbance of a subscriber
or private property owner's property which is not fully and completely restored
or repaired as required in division (A) of this section.
   (C)   The types of acts specifically included in this section are the
following:
      (1)   Removal of a subscriber's sod, lawn, plants, shrubbery, flowers,
trees, driveway, or fence to install, trench, repair, replace remove, or locate
cable or other equipment of an MCS provider;
      (2)   Installation or removal of cable or other equipment of an MCS
provider within a subscriber's residence which requires drilling, excavating,
plastering, or the like on the part of the MCS provider;
      (3)   Temporarily relocating or moving a piece of personal property or a
fixture of a subscriber, such as a motor vehicle, fence, air conditioning or
heating unit, or the like, in order to perform some sort of construction,
maintenance, or repair on the multi-channel system; or
      (4)   Permanently removing an MCS provider's cable or equipment due to
either the revocation, termination, or non-renewal of a franchise (if
applicable), or the abandonment, withdrawal, or cessation of multi-channel
service to any portion of the city.
   (D)   The requirements imposed upon the MCS provider extend to any
subcontractor or independent contractor that the MCS provider might employ to
perform the tasks outlined in this section.
   (E)   In light of the foregoing, an MCS provider has the authority and
responsibility to diligently trim trees of a private property owner (including
a subscriber), but only to the extent necessary to prevent the branches of the
trees from coming in contact with the MCS provider's wires and cables. The
manner of trimming shall be approved in writing by the Council/approving
authority.

§ 112.075 SERVICE INQUIRIES, REQUESTS, COMPLAINTS, AND RESPONSE TIMES.
   (A)   Except in times of a natural or man-made emergency, or an appointment
scheduled with the mutual consent of a subscriber, an MCS provider shall
respond to the service inquiries, requests, and complaints of subscribers
within such MCS provider's normal business or service hours, and within the
time schedules detailed in divisions (B) through (G) of this section. Moreover,
except in emergency situations, an MCS provider shall inform the customer
whether the service call is scheduled for the morning, afternoon, or evening
hours. If the service call has to be canceled or rearranged, then the MCS
provider shall make every effort to notify the customer as soon as possible,
and shall (unless the subscriber decides otherwise) re-schedule the service
call for a time within 24 hours of the cancellation. The term service call as
used in this section does not refer to initial installation.
   (B)   In the case of a signal or service interruption, an MCS provider shall
respond to and make repairs as are necessary to resume the signal or service to
the subscriber within 24 hours from the time the MCS provider first received
notification of the signal of service interruption.
   (C)   In the case of a blank or no-picture situation of any given level of
billing or service (except for pay-per-view events), an MCS provider shall
respond to and make repairs as are necessary to return the multi-channel
service within 24 hours from the time the MCS provider first received
notification of the blank or no-picture situation.
   (D)   In the case of a defective, improperly operating, or non-operating
piece of equipment, an MCS provider shall respond to and make repairs as are
necessary to correct the problem within 36 hours from the time the MCS provider
first received notification of the defective, improperly operating, or non-
operating piece of equipment.
   (E)   In the case of repair to a piece of equipment in a subscriber's
residence, or repair to the cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent),
the repair should be completed and the situation resolved at the conclusion of
the first service visit. If the repair is not completed and resolved within 3
visits, and if as a result of the insufficient repair a situation remains
wherein there is a visually or audibly detected degradation of a multi-channel
signal, then the MCS provider must immediately and completely either replace
all drop cable (coaxial, fiber or its functional equivalent), or isolate and
correct the source of signal degradation in order to rectify the situation.
   (F)   In no case shall a subscriber's service request or inquiry go
unresponded or unattended to for more than one work day from the time the MCS
provider first received notification of the service inquiry or request.
Moreover, except in emergency situations, all requests and inquiries shall be
handled or corrected within 36 hours from the time the MCS provider first
received notification. If a cancellation of a service call occurs, then the MCS
provider shall re-schedule the call in a manner consistent with the guidelines
expressed in division (A) of this section.
   (G)   In case of a dispute concerning the precise time that the MCS provider
received notification, or the precise circumstances surrounding the MCS
provider receiving the notification, or whether notification was received at
all, the Council/franchising authority shall reserve the right and authority to
settle such a dispute.
   (H)   Provided, however, that the MCS provider may rank service calls in
order of severity. That is, total outages will take precedence over area
outages; area outages take precedence over a single home and multi-channel
problems take presidency over a single channel.

§ 112.076 REPAIR PARTS AND REPAIR PERSONNEL.
   (A)   Except in times of natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider
shall, at all times, have access to and be able to secure sufficient
maintenance and repair parts and equipment for the MCS system so that the MCS
provider can respond to and correct all subscriber service interruptions within
the time periods specified in this chapter.
   (B)   Having access to and being able to secure sufficient maintenance and
repair parts and equipment is necessary to promptly restore a subscriber's
multi-channel service and avoid delays caused by having to obtain needed parts
and equipment.
   (C)   Except in times of natural or man-made emergency, or a strike (whose
duration has been less than 72 hours), an MCS provider shall have sufficient
maintenance and repair personnel so that the MCS provider can respond to and
correct subscriber service interruptions within the time periods specified in
this chapter.
   (D)   An MCS provider shall annually certify the Council/franchising
authority that each service technician has taken and passed an MCS provider-
implemented course designed to train service technicians to handle their jobs
in a courteous, efficient, and responsive manner. Also, the course should be
designed to provide continuing education to service technicians in changes in
technology, repair/maintenance procedures and related matters.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the other requirements and provisions contained in
this section, an MCS provider shall maintain at least one service technician on
call 24 hours per day.

SHORT-TERM, PAY-PER-VIEW, AND MENU-DRIVEN; RE-CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   New installations, promotional, short-term, or seasonal connections,
re-connections, and upgrades of multi-channel service by an MCS provider shall
be performed and completed within seven days of a customer requesting such.
   (B)   The provisions of division (A) shall not apply to pay-per-view or
menu-driven connections.
   (C)   While an MCS provider may charge a customer for installing,
connecting, or re-connecting multi-channel service, such charge must be
understood and approved by the customer prior to the installation, connection,
or re-connection.
   (D)   In the case of a promotional or seasonal connection, any limitations
or restrictions must be explained prior to the promotional or seasonal
connection.
   (E)   Any MCS provider may charge an appropriate re-connection charge or
require a security deposit in those instances where a customer is re-connected
after an involuntary disconnection for non-payment or a prior history of
unsatisfactory payment. However, the re-connection charge or security deposit
must be based on the prior unsatisfactory payment history, or involuntary
disconnection or the customer, and not the location or address of the residence
or structure.
   (F)   Downgrading a particular service level or service cluster to a lower-
priced or less compre-hensive service or cluster level shall not be considered
a connection to the lower-priced or less compre-hensive level of service. An
MCS provider shall comply with all rules concerning downgrading.

§ 112.079 RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS/INQUIRIES.
   (A)   An MCS provider is required to develop a comprehensive complaint/
inquiry resolution policy that is consistent with the rules and regulations
outlined in this chapter.
   (B)   An MCS provider's complaint/inquiry resolution policy shall be reduced
in writing, and such policy shall be available upon request to any person. In
any event, a subscriber shall receive notice of such policy in the manner that
is prescribed by this chapter.
   (C)   The Council/franchising authority shall establish a neutral, third-
party appeal process to handle complaints/inquiries that are not satisfactorily

§ 112.080 CONTINUITY OF MULTI-CHANNEL SERVICE PROVISIONS; POLICY.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority declares that as part of its right
to establish multi-channel customer service guidelines, it has the duty to
ensure continuity of multi-channel service for all subscribers. In that light,
the Council/franchising authority also determines that it may take appropriate
measures in order to ensure that no portion of the city is threatened or faced
with a disruption, interruption, or discontinuance of multi-channel service due
to the actions of any MCS provider.
   (B)   In addition to the principles and ideals enumerated in division (A),
the Council/franchising authority also expresses that its policy covers the
following:
      (1)   To provide for continuity of multi-channel service in the event of
acquisition by the city;
      (2)   To provide for continuity of service in the event of a proposed
abandonment, withdrawal, or cessation of multi-channel service by an MCS
provider;
      (3)   To provide for continuity of service in the event of revocation,
termination, or non-renewal of a franchised MCS provider's franchise;
      (4)   To provide for continuity of service in the event that a
transaction occurs that affects the ownership or control of the MCS provider,
such as an assignment, sale, transfer, or merger;
      (5)   To provide for continuity of service in the event of an expiration
of a franchise;
      (6)   To prevent disruption of multi-channel service which would provide
a hardship on those subscribers who rely on a multi-channel system as their
primary or secondary source for information; and
      (7)   To prevent the interruption or cessation of multi-channel service
which would disrupt or eliminate the diversity of programming choices enjoyed
by subscribers of a multi-channel system, and thereby restricting their ability
to receive information.
   (C)   In any situation, including those mentioned above, which threatens the
city and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-
channel service, then the MCS provider shall provide the Council/franchising
authority with at least 45 days notice (except in extreme circumstances) prior
to the effective date of any action which would cause a loss or interruption in
the continuity of multi-channel service. The purpose of the notice is to
apprise the Council/franchising authority of the possibility of such loss or
interruption in the continuity of multi-channel service so that it might
explore its options and take appropriate measures.
   (D)   Whenever any situation occurs, including those mentioned above, which
threatens the city and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the
continuity of multi-channel service, then the Council/franchising authority may
direct the MCS provider for a period of up to 24 months to do everything in its
power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted multi-
channel service of the same quality, mix, and level(s) regardless of the
circumstances.
   (E)   During the interim period, the Council/franchising authority shall
work with the MCS provider in order to secure a new multi-channel system owner,
or rectify the problem, so that the threat of loss of continuity is removed at
the earliest possible instance.
   (F)   During any interim period in which the MCS provider continues to
provide multi-channel service to subscribers, the MCS provider is entitled to
all revenues collected, except sums owed (including franchise fees, alternative
user charges, and taxes) to the city or to other persons.
   (G)   In the event that the threat of loss of continuity is not resolved
within 24 months, then the Council/franchising authority may extend the interim
period on a month-to-month basis until the situation is satisfactorily
resolved. Also, in such a circumstance, the Council/franchising authority may
adopt any emergency rules or procedures which will ensure that the subscribers
will receive continuous, uninterrupted multi-channel service of the same
quality, mix, and level(s).
   (H)   Nothing in this section should be construed as requiring an MCS
provider to operate a multi-channel system at a continued financial loss (due
to bankruptcy or insolvency) for an extended period of time. In such case,
while the Council/franchising authority may require continuity of service, it
must lift such requirement as soon as the threat of loss of service is removed.
Consequently, the Council/franchising authority must take appropriate steps to
both ensure the continuity of service, and minimize the financial loss incurred
by the MCS provider if the abandonment, cessation, or withdrawal is caused by
bankruptcy, or insolvency.

   (A)   All wires, conduits, cable (coaxial, fiber, or functional equivalent),
and other property and facilities of an MCS provider shall be so located,
constructed, installed and maintained so as not to endanger or unnecessarily
interfere with usual and customary use, traffic and travel upon the streets,
rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the city.
   (B)   In the event an MCS provider's system creates a hazardous or unsafe
condition or an unreasonable interference with property, then at its own
expense such MCS provider shall voluntarily, or upon the request of the
Council/franchising authority remove that part of the system that creates the
hazardous condition from the subject property.
   (C)   An MCS provider shall not place equipment where it will interfere with
the rights of property owners or with gas, electric or telephone fixtures, or
with water hydrants or mains, or with wastewater lift stations, or any other
service or facility that benefits the city's or its residents' health, safety,
or welfare.
   (D)   An MCS provider, at either its own expense or that of a private
contractor, shall protect, rights of and easements, and support or temporarily
disconnect or relocate in the same street or other public way, any property of
such MCS provider when necessitated by reason of:
      (1)   Traffic conditions;
      (2)   Public safety;
      (3)   A street closing;
      (4)   Street construction or re-surfacing;
      (5)   Change or establishment of street grade;
      (6)   Installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, storm drains, lift
stations, force mains, power or signal lines; or
      (7)   An improvement, construction or repair related to the city's or its
residents' health, safety, or welfare.
   (E)   Upon 24 hours verbal or written notice, it shall be the responsibility
of an MCS provider (acting alone or in conjunction with another person) to
locate and mark or otherwise visibly indicate and alert others to the location
of its underground cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) before
employees, agents, or independent contractors of any entity install cable,
power or utility lines in the marked-off area.
   (F)   An MCS provider shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit, temporarily remove, raise or lower the cable wires to allow the
moving of the building. The expense of temporary removal shall be paid by the
person requesting it, and such MCS provider may require payment in advance. The
affected MCS provider shall be given not less than 10 days notice of a
contemplated move to arrange for temporary wire changes.
   (G)   For any new installations occurring after the effective date of this
chapter, and at the time that an MCS provider rebuilds or upgrades the multi-
channel system, all trunk or feeder cable (coaxial, fiber or functional
equivalent) shall be placed underground when and if utilities are placed
underground. Further, where both power and utilities are presently underground,
multi-channel system cable shall also be placed underground.
   (H)   It shall be the responsibility of any MCS provider to comply with the
most current FCC technical standards.

§ 112.098 DUTY TO REMOVE FRANCHISED PROPERTIES FROM THE PUBLIC STREETS.
   (A)   This section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a
franchise to operate within the city.
   (B)   Whenever the following occurs, then, unless the city or another MCS
provider uses such multi-channel system under the continuity provisions
outlined in this chapter, the affected franchised MCS provider shall promptly
remove its multi-channel system property from the streets, public ways, and
private property located within the city:
      (1)   A franchised MCS provider ceases to operate all or part of the
multi-channel system for a continuous period of six months;
      (2)   A franchised MCS provider ceases and fails to construct the multi-
channel system outlined in the application, or proposal for renewal, or renewal
franchise agreement;
      (3)   The Council/franchising authority elects not to renew the franchise
pursuant to the provisions set forth in this chapter; or
      (4)   The franchised MCS provider's franchise is revoked pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this chapter.
   (C)   If not removed voluntarily by a franchised MCS provider, then the
Council/franchising authority may notify such franchised MCS provider that if
removal of the property is not accommodated within 180 days, or substantial
progress towards removal is not made within 120 days, then the Council/
franchising authority may direct officials or representatives of the city to
remove such franchised MCS provider's system property at that franchised MCS
provider's expense. The performance and/or construction bond, irrevocable
letter of credit, cash deposit, or full faith and credit guarantee required as
set forth in this chapter shall be available to pay for such work.
   (D)   If officials or representatives of the city remove a franchised MCS
provider's system property, and such franchised MCS provider does not claim the
property within 90 days of its removal, then the Council/franchising authority
may take whatever steps are available under state law to declare the property
surplus, and sell it, with the proceeds of such sale (if permitted by state
law) going to the city.
   (E)   When such franchised MCS provider removes its multi-channel system
property from the streets, public ways, and private property located within the
city, the franchised MCS provider shall, at its own expense, and in a manner
approved by the Council/franchising authority, replace and restore such public
or private property in as good a condition as before the work causing the
disturbance was done.

§ 112.099 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Methods of construction, installation, maintenance repair of any
multi-channel system shall comply with the most current editions of the
National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electric Code, as affects the
construction, installation, and maintenance of electrical supply and
communication lines and attachments and supports. To the extent that these are
inconsistent with other provisions of a franchise or state or local law, then
the state or local law shall apply.
   (B)   All construction, installation, maintenance, and repair shall treat
the aesthetics of the property as a priority, shall not substantially affect
the appearance of the structure, and shall not be installed on the bias across
the property or any side of a residence or other structure without the property
owner's written permission.
   (C)   All underground drops shall follow (to the greatest extent possible)
property lines, and cross property only at right angles, unless otherwise
permitted in writing by the property owner, required due to the physical
characteristics of the subsurface, or required under city, state, or federal
rules.

Penalty, see § 112.999
§ 112.101 SYSTEM EXPANSION FOR MCS PROVIDERS.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that one of its primary
purposes in the franchising process is to ensure that the widest diversity of
programming source be available to the greatest number of city residents. The
Council/franchising authority is also cognizant that an MCS provider may have
some constitutionality protected rights with respect to when and what areas of
the city are provided service.
   (B)   In order to balance those interests, the Council/franchising authority
sets the minimum guidelines for any system expansion on the part of a
franchised MCS provider.
   (C)   A franchised MCS provider shall submit, within four months of the
effective date of this chapter, a detailed plan for multi-channel system
expansion to any area not presently served within the city. Such plan should
not be construed as a requirement for universal service, but rather as a means
for achieving the Council/franchising authority's goals, mentioned in division
(A). However, at a minimum, a franchised MCS provider shall extend multi-
channel service to any area within the city that has a density of five home or
building passings per mile, or fractional equivalent thereof, as measured from
the extremity of the system nearest the unserved area. Also, in such a case, a
newly installed subscriber shall not be assessed or apportioned the cost for
installation, except for the usual and normal connection fees paid by
subscribers.
   (D)   The detailed plan must include criteria for extending the provision of
service to isolated subscribers. For purposes of this section, isolated
subscribers means any potential customer of a franchised MCS provider who
dwells in a house more than ½ mile from the nearest franchised MCS provider
connection.

§ 112.103 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS; POLICY.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority requires that the MCS provider's
construction, operation, and maintenance of the multi-channel system meet
certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the public and
lessen the likelihood of interruption of multi-channel service.
   (B)   Consequently, the Council/franchising authority requires an MCS
provider to adopt the following safety requirements:
      (1)   Emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this
chapter;
      (2)   Minimum standby power as noted in this chapter;
      (3)   The provision of signal alert technology in the manner noted in
this chapter;
      (4)   Implementing a periodic preventative maintenance program as set
forth in this chapter;
      (5)   Follow all FCC rules and regulations concerning maximum cumulative
leakage index (CLI) limits; and
      (6)   Comply with and abide by any construction, safety or fire codes, as
noted in this chapter or required by local law.

§ 112.104 PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of an MCS provider to devise and implement a
periodic preventative maintenance program for the multi-channel system in order
to ensure that there is no material degradation of the multi-channel system
that would affect the citizens' health, safety, and welfare, or negatively
affect the quality of multi-channel services being provided. The requirements
of this section shall be construed as augmenting and clarifying applicable FCC
regulations.
   (B)   The Council/franchising authority shall have the right of approval of
any preventive maintenance program. Within 45 days after the completion of any
preventive maintenance component test, the MCS provider shall prepare and
submit a written report (except for daily or weekly components, and tests which
may be submitted once a quarter) to the Council/franchising authority detailing
the results of the tests conducted, and all items performed or addressed during
the periodic preventive maintenance program. Although not exhaustive, the
following areas should be included in a preventive maintenance program, and
subsequent report:
      (1)   inspection and repair, if needed, of the headend;
      (2)   Inspection and repair, if needed, of the antenna tower;
      (3)   Requiring weather-proofing and protection of the antenna lead
connectors and on any other exposed fittings;
      (4)   Requiring the conducting of signal leakage tests that are in accord
with FCC requirements;
      (5)   Removal of tree roots, limbs, and branches that interfere with or
come in contact with the MCS provider's cable;
      (6)   Requiring the periodic servicing, testing, and calibration of the
MCS provider's equipment, including service vehicles and field test equipment;
      (7)   Employing a status monitoring system to identify problems or
situations in which the multi-channel system electronics are operating outside
pre-programmed parameters;
      (8)   Testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will
function properly during an emergency situation;
      (9)   Testing of the safety alert system or technology, if provided;
      (10)    Testing and recording of test data for all signals (audio and
video) at the headend and all system extremity points;
      (11)    Testing as required or allowed by federal law or regulation; and
      (12)    Meet all operating parameters as may be set or allowed by the
FCC, and as such may be changed or amended from time to time.

§ 112.106 ALTERNATIVE USER CHARGE.
   (A)   This section is applicable to any licensed but otherwise authorized
MCS provider, and to any MCS provider who has had its franchise ruled
unconstitutional, unenforceable, or invalid. For all franchised MCS providers
the provisions concerning franchise fees shall be applicable.
   (B)   Where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law, and as an
alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this chapter,
the Council/franchising authority may impose, extract, and collect a charge
from an affected MCS provider for the use by such provider of the streets,
rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the city.
   (C)   The alternative user charge shall be based on the following
mathematical mode:
      (1)   Determine the present value of all public streets, rights-of-way,
easements, and public ways of the city in which are located multi-channel
system facilities and equipment of the affected MCS provider;
      (2)   Take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the
city, as determined by the Property Appraiser for the city, for the five
preceding years;
      (3)   Take the average percentage increase for the five preceding years
and use it to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the
remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable, then use five
years);
      (4)   Add the present value to the dollar amount of property value
increase for the remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable
then use five years);
      (5)   Divide the adjusted value of the remaining number of years on the
term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);
      (6)   Multiply that figure by 5% to arrive at the annual user charge that
is to be collected from the affected MCS provider.
      (7)   For purposes of illustration only, the formula reads as follows:
      present value = dollar amount of property plus increase for remaining
term of the franchise (based on average percentage increase of land appraisals
for past years of franchise term) divide the adjusted value by the remaining
years on the term of the franchise, multiply that figure by 5% = (equals) the
annual alternative user charge.
   (D)   The Council/franchising authority adopts such an alternative user
charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected MCS provider's
use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be
obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such MCS provider's annual gross
revenues. However, an affected MCS provider may agree to an alternative charge
that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenues, as long as that charge
does not exceed 5% of an affected MCS provider's annual gross revenues.
   (E)   Also, recognizing that an alternative user charge may affect a
franchised MCS provider, please note that the franchise agreement may contain
express language which details a different method or manner to handle a
situation in which franchise fees as historically calculated (as a percentage
of gross revenues) are ruled unconstitutional or unenforceable, in order to
protect and preserve the city's source of revenue and compensation for the use
of the public rights-of-way.
   (F)   It is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative
user charge will not be imposed on the same MCS provider at the same time, for
the same period.
   (G)   An affected MCS provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to
pay an alternative user charge that exceeds 5% of such provider's gross
revenues (as defined by this chapter) for any particular reporting period. In
the event that the alternative user charge does exceed 5% of gross revenues,
then such alternative user charge shall be reduced to reflect an amount not
greater than the 5% cap.
   (H)   An affected MCS provider shall pay 25% of the alternative user charge
at the end of every three months.

FRANCHISES
§ 112.120 FRANCHISE REQUIRED; EXCEPTION.
   (A)   Except as provided in divisions (B), (C), and (D) of this section, no
person or MCS provider shall be permitted to construct, operate or maintain a
multi-channel system which requires the laying or positioning of cable
(coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) across the rights-of-way of the city
without having first obtained a franchise, and then entering into a franchise
agreement with the city.
   (B)   Pursuant to federal Law, a local government may own and operate a
multi-channel system classified as a cable system. Consequently, should the
Council/franchising authority directly or indirectly, through any legal means
available to the Council/franchising authority, decide to purchase, acquire,
construct, lease, control, or otherwise own a cable system within the
territorial limits of the city, then the Council/franchising authority shall
not be required to submit a proposal for or receive a franchise in order to
construct, operate, and maintain a cable system within the geographical limits
of the city.
    (C)   If, as a result of annexation subsequent to the effective date of
this chapter, a previously unfranchised MCS provider comes under the
jurisdiction of the city, then such MCS provider shall be required to obtain a
franchise and enter into a franchise agreement.
   (D)   If a MCS provider is required to obtain a franchise, then the Council/
franchising authority shall notify the MCS provider, in writing, within 30 days
of the Council/franchising authority's formal action.
   (E)   After receipt of notification, the affected person or MCS provider has
90 days to submit an application or proposal in substantially the same form and
format as required by the Council/franchising authority. Then, the MCS
provider's application will be handled as set forth by either federal, state or
local law.
   (F)   It is the intent of the city/franchising authority that as a matter of
policy all MCS provider franchises shall contain substantially similar minimum
terms and conditions. However, this shall not apply to legitimate SMATV
operators who may cross only one street or right-of-way.
   (G)   The city/franchising authority, to the extent permitted by law, shall
always have the right to grant or deny a franchise as may be deemed in the
public interest.

the Council/franchising authority may award one or more non-exclusive multi-
channel service franchises within its geographical limits.
   (B)   A franchised MCS provider shall be selected as part of a public
proceeding and hearing which affords due process to both the city and the
applicant, and after which, if the applicant is selected as a franchised MCS
provider, then such applicant will enter into a franchise agreement with the
city, pursuant to the provisions of federal, state and local laws and
regulations.

part of the city, or approves a proposal for a renewal of a franchise, the
applicant or renewal applicant and the city shall negotiate a franchise
agreement which details the rights, duties, responsibilities, and liabilities
of both parties.
   (B)   A newly franchised MCS provider may not lay any cable (coaxial, fiber,
or functional equivalent) until the franchise agreement is executed by both the
newly franchised MCS provider and the Council/franchising authority.
   (C)   A franchise agreement shall be in sufficient detail in order to
clearly delineate the rights and duties of the franchised MCS provider and the
Council/franchising authority.
   (D)   At a minimum, a franchise agreement shall contain provisions for the
following:
      (1)   A detailed definition of annual gross revenues or gross revenues
which specifically includes an explanation of what constitutes the revenue base
for determining what revenues are subject to any franchise fee or alternative
user charge;
      (2)   The term or duration of the franchise;

chapter clarifications noted with respect to the MCS provider's operation of a
franchised multi-channel system; and
      (12)    Geographical limits of the franchise.
   (E)   Regardless of the need for a franchise for any particular technology
or provider, the city/franchising authority, to the extent allowed by state or
federal law, retains the right to impose certain minimum requirements as may be
deemed in the public interest. Such minimum requirements shall specifically
include matters related to customer service standards and consumer protection
requirements as set forth in this chapter.

§ 112.123 EXTENT OF GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Upon an award of a franchise and the execution of the franchise
agreement, an MCS provider required to obtain and maintain a franchise may
construct, erect, install, maintain, operate, repair, replace, remove, or

franchise agreement.
   (B)   The franchised multi-channel system may be located in, upon, along,
across, over, and under the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways

   (C)   If necessary, the responsibility of obtaining easements for private
property (including privately owned utility or street light poles) shall be
that of a franchised MCS provider.
   (D)   A franchised MCS provider, through a separate pole or utility easement
agreement with an affected utility, may locate the multi-channel system on or
within the property of such utility company. This provision specifically
includes MCS providers classified as cable operators.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
 § 112.124 TERM OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   The term of an initial or renewal franchise may be for a period not to
exceed 15 years from the date that a franchise renewal agreement is approved by
the Council/franchising authority.
   (B)   If an initial franchise or renewal franchise is for a period of six
years or less, then the franchise agreement shall detail the reasons for
granting the shorter franchise term.
   (C)   The reasons for a franchise term of six years or less include, but are
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Multiple or repeated violations of the prior franchise agreement;
      (2)   Multiple or repeated violations of this chapter, or any mandated
provisions of federal law or regulations;
      (3)   A continuing and documented pattern of substandard or non-
responsive service;
      (4)   Reckless disregard for the safety and welfare of the citizens of
the city;
      (5)   Failure to comply with any construction, rebuild, or upgrade
schedule;
      (6)   Failure to timely pay in their entirety any franchise fees, taxes,
or other charges due to the city; and
      (7)   Refusal to increase channel capacity and service to the level
offered by any other MCS provider within a 100 mile radius of the city.
   (D)   The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to grant a
franchised MCS provider a variable franchise term, wherein the initial or
renewal term may be extended by up to three years, not to exceed 15 years
total, upon the franchised MCS provider attaining an excellent rating during
the course of a periodic performance evaluation.
   (E)   Should the highest court of the nation or state invalidate or void as
unenforceable or unconstitutional the concept of a franchise or franchise
duration, then the Council/franchising authority may adopt emergency rules and
regulations in order to preserve and protect the rights and duties of both the
Council/franchising authority and any franchised MCS provider. During the
interim, the invalid franchise may be considered (unless prohibited by the
state) and interpreted in the same manner and fashion as a business license.
Upon the adoption of emergency rules, the Council/franchising authority should
enter into a new agreement which describes under which terms and conditions of
the franchised MCS provider's system may be reviewed and examined, and under
what circumstances may a franchised MCS provider forfeit its right to operate a
multi-channel system within all or part of the city.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.125 APPLICATION FOR FRANCHISE; APPLICATION FEE.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority may develop rules and regulations
with respect to the submission and processing of applications for an initial
franchise. Such rules and regulations shall primarily be aimed at determining
the legal, financial, technical, and character qualifications of the applicant.
   (B)   Unless prohibited, an initial applicant shall pay an application fee
which shall be equal to the administrative and consulting costs associated with
processing an application for a franchise. The total application fee must be
paid, unless waived, regardless of whether the applicant receives or does not
receive a franchise. The total application fee must be paid (or waived) prior
to the Council/franchising authority's formal action on the applicant's request
for a franchise.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.126 FRANCHISE FEES.
   (A)   Any franchised MCS provider (specifically including any MCS provider
classified as a cable operator) awarded a franchise or renewal franchise after
the date this chapter becomes effective shall pay to the city for the privilege
and use of the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways, and other
facilities of the city in the operation of the multi-channel system, and for
the city's supervision thereof during the term of the franchise, a sum of up to
5% of the annual gross revenues of such non-exempt franchised MCS provider.
   (B)   If the FCC, Congress or other governmental entity with authority over
multi-channel service ever allows a governmental entity or Council/franchising
authority to increase the franchise fee beyond 5%, then the Council/franchising
authority shall have the authority to increase the franchise fee to the maximum
rate allowable.
   (C)   It is intended that the franchise fees will promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. Therefore, the 5% franchise
fee shall be deposited into the general revenue of the city, unless
specifically authorized elsewhere.
   (D)   A franchised MCS provider shall file with the Council/franchising
authority, within 60 days after the expiration of each of the franchised MCS
provider's fiscal quarters, a detailed financial and revenue statement clearly
showing the gross revenues received by such franchised MCS provider during the
preceding quarter and certified by a certified public accountant or officer of
a franchised MCS provider attesting to the accuracy, completeness, and veracity
of the revenue figures. Such statement shall be in the form and format
determined by the Council/franchising authority. Such statement shall include
revenue from whatever source, directly or indirectly derived from, or allowed,
or caused to be derived from, or applicable to the operation of the multi-
channel system, or the provision of any multi-channel service by or to the
multi-channel system, for those revenues and revenue sources applicable to or
affecting the franchise fee or the computational base for the franchise fee.
Revenue will be reported by service category, type, and level showing
computations and using incremental billing rates for all sources, levels,
tiers, and types of service and other revenue sources of all kinds and types.
   (E)   Payment of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be
rendered to the city at the time the financial and revenue statement is filed.
   (F)   In the event that full payment is not made within 45 days after the
date specified in this section, then such franchised MCS provider may be
declared in default of the franchise, and the franchise may be revoked,
terminated, or canceled in the manner prescribed by this chapter.
   (G)   The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to audit a
franchised MCS provider's books, if the Council/franchising authority deems it
necessary. If such audit discovers an underpayment of franchise fees that
exceeds 1% of the total fee paid for any reporting quarter, then the affected
franchised MCS provider shall reimburse the city for the cost of such an audit.
It is specifically understood that the right of audit and re-computation of any
and all amounts paid under a franchise fee shall always be accorded to the
Council/franchising authority. It is further understood that the Council/
franchising authority shall be bound by the result of any audit it performs or
causes to be performed, except for instances involving fraud.
   (H)   If an audit or other research discovers that franchise fees have been
either underpaid or not paid for a period exceeding six months from the
original due date, then the city may seek full recovery of the underpaid or
non-paid fees plus interest not to exceed 15% or the maximum allowable under
state law (whichever is less). The audit may cover a period not to exceed 48
months prior to the date of audit and the MCS provider is required to retain
its books and records for all periods subject to audit.
   (I)   All annual reports due and pertaining to the payment of franchise fees
will be certified by an officer of the franchised MCS provider, and such
provider shall maintain records used in the preparation of the report to be
produced in their originality and totality upon request or demand by the
Council/franchising authority.
   (J)   No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release of, or an
accord, or satisfaction of any claim that the city might have for further or
additional sums payable under the terms of this chapter, or for any other
performance or obligation of a franchised MCS provider hereunder.
   (K)   Payments of compensation made by a franchised MCS provider to the
city, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be considered in
addition to and exclusive of any and all authorized taxes, business license
fees, other fees, other levies or assessments presently in effect, or
subsequently adopted.
   (L)   A franchise fee does not include any items specifically excluded by
federal law.
   (M)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the Council/franchising authority to impose a tax, fee or other assessment of
any kind, on any person (other than a franchised MCS provider) with respect to
multi-channel service or other programming or communications service provided
by such person over a multi-channel system for which charges are assessed to
subscribers, but not received by a franchised MCS provider. For purposes of
illustration only, this division shall include the situation(s) where a premium
service directly bills a subscriber, or the franchised MCS provider merely acts
as collection agent for a premium service billing directly to a subscriber, or
where a person leases a channel for commercial use and sells advertising or
goods on that channel, and receives the money directly or through a third
party.
   (N)   For any 12 month period, the fees paid by any person subject to
division (M) who provides any such multi-channel service shall not exceed 5% of
such person's gross revenues derived in such period from the provision of such
service over the multi-channel system, or the maximum allowed by law at any
time.
   (O)   If, at any time, the highest court of the nation or the state
invalidates, voids, or rules as unconstitutional the concept of franchise fees,
then the Council/franchising authority may impose an alternative user charge on
the franchised MCS provider in the manner set forth in this chapter.
   (P)   In light of division (O) of this section, and recognizing that an
alternative user charge may affect a franchised MCS provider, please note that
the franchise agreement may contain express language which details a different
method or manner for collection of franchise fees should the way they
historically have been calculated (as a percentage of gross revenues) be ruled
unconstitutional or unenforceable, so that the city's source of revenue and
compensation for the use of the public right-of-way may be protected.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
Penalty, see § 112.999
§ 112.127 ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Where required for operation, an MCS provider's franchise may not be
assigned or transferred in whole or in part by the affected MCS provider
without the prior express written approval by the Council/franchising
authority.
   (B)   Any attempted assignment or transfer without such prior written
consent shall constitute a default of such franchise.
   (C)   In the event of such a default, the Council/franchising authority
shall proceed according to the procedure set forth in this chapter, and any
applicable federal or state law.
   (D)   At least 90 days before a proposed assignment or transfer of an MCS
provider's franchise is scheduled to become effective, such franchised MCS
provider shall petition in writing for the Council/franchising authority's
written consent for such a proposed assignment or transfer.
   (E)   The Council/franchising authority will not unreasonably withhold its
consent to such an assignment or transfer. However, in making such a
determination, the Council/franchising authority may consider the following:
      (1)   Experience of proposed assignee or transferee, including conducting
an investigation of proposed assignee or transferee's service records in other
communities;
      (2)   Qualifications of proposed assignee or transferee;
      (3)   Legal integrity of proposed assignee or transferee;
      (4)   Financial ability and stability of the proposed assignee or
transferee;
      (5)   If requested by the Council/franchising authority, submittals from
the proposed assignee or transferee on what, if any, changes it intends to make
in the operation and maintenance of the present multi-channel system;
      (6)   The corporate connection, if any, between the franchised MCS
provider and proposed assignee or transferee;
      (7)   The economic viability or non-viability of the multi-channel system
in the future, based upon certain factors including the impact of the purchase
price on the city and/or the proposed assignee or transferee; and
      (8)   Any other legitimate aspect of the proposed assignee's or
transferee's background which could affect the health, safety, and welfare of
the citizenry of the city as it relates to the operation of the multi-channel
system.
   (F)   Unless disclosure is demonstrated by the MCS provider to be
specifically prohibited by law, a copy of the completed sales agreement or a
functionally equivalent instrument between the franchised MCS provider and
proposed assignee or transferee shall be provided to the Council/franchising
authority so that the Council/franchising authority may discover the assumption
of obligations by the franchised MCS provider and proposed assignee or
transferee with respect to the multi-channel system. In lieu of the sales
agreement, the Council/franchising authority may, by prior written agreement,
accept an attested summary of obligations assumed by the above-referenced
parties.
   (G)   Before an assignment or transfer is approved by the Council/
franchising authority, the proposed assignee or transferee shall execute an
affidavit acknowledging that it has read, understood, and intends to abide by
both this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement.
   (H)   In the event of any approved assignment or transfer, the assignee or
transferee shall assume all obligations and liabilities of the former
franchised MCS provider, except as noted in division (I).
   (I)   An assignment or transfer shall not relieve the former franchised MCS
provider of its liabilities under the franchise agreement until the assignment
actually takes place, or unless specifically relieved by the Council/
franchising authority at the time an assignment or transfer is approved.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.128 DEFAULT OF FRANCHISE; REVOCATION, TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION OF
FRANCHISE.
   (A)   When any event, act or omission on the part of the franchised MCS
provider occurs which represents a violation of a material provision of this
chapter, or compromises the corporate character, or legal, financial or
technical integrity and/or stability of the multi-channel system or the
franchise MCS provider to such a degree that the interests of the subscribers
and users are negatively affected, then such event, act or omission may be
considered a major breach of this chapter. Under such circumstances, the
Council/franchising authority shall notify the affected MCS provider in writing
of the specific breach and direct such franchised MCS provider to comply with
all such provisions of its proposal, franchise agreement, or this chapter.
   (B)   For illustrative purposes only, the events, acts and omissions
include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy, insolvency, failure to pay taxes
or franchise fees (including the alternative user charge if applicable),
failure to receive written Council/franchising authority approval for an
assignment or transfer, demonstrating a repeated pattern or practice of
conscious disregard for non-material provisions of this chapter or a franchise
agreement or failure to abide by the material terms and conditions of the
franchise agreement, or material provisions of this chapter. For purposes of
this section, “material” means a provision which either affects the ability of
the customer to receive multi-channel service or affects the ability of the
Council/franchising authority to evaluate an MCS provider's performance in the
technical, financial, and legal aspects of the multi-channel system.
   (C)   Where a franchise MCS provider satisfactorily corrects any of the
enumerated conditions within 45 days, then in no event shall the enumerated
condition be weighed against such franchised MCS provider in any subsequent
review of franchise performance.
   (D)   A copy of such notice of material breach or other conditions which may
compel default, revocation, termination or cancellation of a franchise shall be
mailed to the surety on the performance bond.
   (E)   Within 75 days after such written notice is mailed to a franchised MCS
provider, the Council/franchising authority shall conduct a public hearing on
the matter, unless state law requires a different procedure, in which the state
procedure would control.
   (F)   The Council/franchising authority shall provide written notice to a
franchised MCS provider and the surety of the time and place of the public
hearing in a manner consistent with either state law or approved by the
Council/franchising authority.
   (G)   At the time of the hearing, the affected franchised MCS provider may
present information on the current status of the alleged breach of the
franchise agreement. If the situation has been resolved, or steps are being
taken to resolve the situation, the franchised MCS provider should present the
information at the hearing.
   (H)   If the affected franchised MCS provider fails to attend the hearing,
and has not requested and been granted a continuance of the hearing, then such
franchised MCS provider shall be deemed to have waived its right to a further
continuation of the matter, and may be declared in default of the franchise
agreement.
   (I)   After the public hearing, the Council/franchising authority may
determine the franchised MCS provider to be in compliance and dismiss the
matter, or may determine that the MCS provider has cured any non-compliance and
thereby dismiss the matter. However, the Council/franchising authority may
determine that an chapter violation exists and remains uncured. Consequently,
upon a finding that the MCS provider violated an material chapter provision, or
failed to cure an outstanding chapter violation, the Council/franchising
authority may direct the affected franchised MCS provider to take corrective
action within a specified period of time, or may declare such franchised MCS
provider in default of the franchise agreement, and thereafter, may revoke,
terminate, or cancel the franchise, unless the franchised MCS provider presents
in the opinion of the Council/franchising authority sufficient mitigating
circumstances.
   (J)   If the Council/franchising authority directs corrective action to take
place within a specified time or declares such franchised MCS provider in
default of the franchise agreement, then that declara-tion shall be reduced in
writing, and the notice of corrective action or default shall be mailed to such
franchised MCS provider and surety within 15 days of the Council/franchising
authority's action.
   (K)   If within 45 days the affected franchised MCS provider or surety does
not take significant action to rectify the breach or submit a satisfactory plan
detailing how the affected MCS provider will eliminate the breach, then the
Council/franchising authority shall revoke such MCS provider's franchise, and
shall notify the affected franchised MCS provider and surety forthwith, unless
there are mitigating circumstances.
   (L)   The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to assess any
charges incurred (including costs for consultants, witnesses, and hearing
preparation) in a default and/or revocation proceeding to the franchised MCS
provider.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
Penalty, see § 112.999
§ 112.129 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS.
   The Council/franchising authority is authorized to design a performance
evaluation procedure which periodically monitors compliance of the franchised
MCS provider with the terms and conditions of both the franchise and this
chapter. Moreover, the Council/franchising authority may periodically review
and examine whether a franchised MCS provider's financial, technical, legal,
and character qualifications continue to meet required operational,
maintenance, and performance levels in order to ensure that community needs are
identified and met and the uninterrupted provision of state of the art multi-
channel service is performed. Such performance evaluations may be conducted
biannually during the franchise term, and may be done as part of any required
survey.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
CABLE OPERATORS
§ 112.145 REGULATORY PROVISIONS FOR CABLE OPERATORS.
   (A)   Notification of proposed rate increase.
      (1)   A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of
any increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or
associated equipment at least 30 days before any proposed increase is
effective. The notice shall include a provision stating that protests to such
prices may be filed with the city at P. O. Box 657, Cleburne, Texas, 76033. The
notice shall also include a statement that such protests must be filed with the
city no later than 30 days after the notice is received by the subscriber.
      (2)   In addition to the notice required in subdivision (A)(1), the cable
operator shall give the city a minimum of 30 days advance written notification
of any changes in rates for cable programming service or associated equipment.
   (B)   Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates. A
cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment with the city within 30 day of receiving written
notification from the city that the city has been certified by the Commission
to regulate rates for the basic service tier, or by November 15th, 1993,
whichever is later.
   (C)   City review of basic cable rates and equipment costs.
      (1)   After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its
existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a
proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel
charge that results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the
existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become
effective after 30 days from the date of submission to the city. Provided,
however, that the city may toll this 30-day deadline for an additional time by
issuing a brief written order as described in division (C)(4) within 30 days of
the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the
rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce
additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems
necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is
provided, the provisions of division (D) of this section will apply to such
information.
      (2)   Upon receipt by the city, the cable operator's submittal shall be
available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by
interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city Council
meeting held at any time during the initial 30-day review period. Written
comments shall be addressed to the City Manager and must be received prior to
the end of the 30-day review period.
      (3)   If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review
that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include
a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate, the city will permit the cable
operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing to
justify the rate.
      (4)   (a)   If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material
submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within
the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined
in this chapter, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing
pursuant to this chapter seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier
charges as defined in this chapter, the city may toll the 30-day deadline in
Subdivision (C)(1) of this section to request and/or consider additional
information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows:
            1.   For an additional 90 days in cases not involving cost-of-
service showings; or
            2.   For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service
showings.
         (b)   The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall
explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall
also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its
original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this division,
comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in
subdivision (C)(2) of this section, or orally during at least one city Council
meeting during the period of abatement.
      (5)   If the city has availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days
permitted in Subdivision (C)(3) of this section, and has taken no action within
these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at
the end of the 90 or 150 day periods, or existing rates will remain in effect
at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written
decision disapproving any portion of such rates. Provided, however, that in
order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the
cable operator by the end of the 90 or 150 day period permitted in Subdivision
(C)(3) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of
all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such
amounts were paid.
   (D)   Proprietary information.
      (1)   If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary
information under the provisions of this chapter, the cable operator may submit
therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for
public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to an shall cover
all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If
feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically
separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is
not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall
be identified.
      (2)   Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those
reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from
inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified.
      (3)   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of
Subdivisions (D)(1) and (2) of this section will not be considered.
      (4)   Upon receipt of a request in compliance with Subdivisions (D)(1)
and (2), the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A
letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials
withheld from public inspection.
      (5)   Provided, however, if a written request for the materials is
received by the city pursuant to the Open Records Act, Tex. Gov't Code §§
552.001 et seq., the city will notify the person providing the materials of the
request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the
city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the Attorney General,
pursuant to the Open Records Act, regarding the public availability of the
materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to
request an opinion from the Attorney General, the city may, at is option,
either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public.
      (6)   If the Attorney General issues an opinion or letter ruling
requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials
will be made available for public inspection.
      (7)   If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the city assumes no
obligation to consider the need for non-disclosure.
   (E)   Burden of proof.
      (1)   A cable operator has the burden of providing that its existing or
proposed rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with federal
regulations and this chapter.
      (2)   For an existing or proposed rate for basic service tier or
associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost
of equipment as set forth in this chapter, the cable operator must submit the
appropriate FCC form to the city.
      (3)   For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier that
exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in this chapter, the cable
operator must submit to the city a cost-of-service showing to justify the
proposed rates. The cost-of-service showing must in conformance with Accounting
and Cost Allocation Requirements as adopted and amended by the Commission for
cable system operators.
   (F)   Written decision.
      (1)   The city shall issue a written decision in a ratemaking proceeding
whenever it disapproves an initial rate for the basic service tier or
associated equipment in whole or in part, disapproves a request for a rate
increase in whole or in part, or approves a request for an increase in whole or
in part over the objections of interested parties. The city is not required to
issue a written decision that approves an unopposed existing or proposed rate
for the basic service tier or associated equipment.
      (2)   Public notice shall be given of any written decision required in
Subdivision (F)(1) of this section by making the text of any written decision
available to the public, and by publication of the decision one time in the
official newspaper of the city.
   (G)   Reduction of rates; prescription of rates.
      (1)   The city may order a cable operator to implement a prospective
reduction in basic service tier or associated equipment rates where necessary
to bring rates into compliance with the standards set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   The city may prescribe a reasonable rate for the basic service tier
or associated equipment after it determines that a proposed rate is
unreasonable.
   (H)   Refunds.
      (1)   The city may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that
portion of previously paid rates determined by the city to be in excess of the
permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the
operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate
charges as reasonable. Before ordering a cable operator to refund previously
paid rates to subscribers, the city shall given the operator notice and
opportunity to comment. The operator's opportunity to comment upon the proposed
refunds may be at any meeting of the City Council during the city's period of
review of the operator's rates. If the city has extended its review period, and
has issued an accounting order, then the operator, prior to refunds being
ordered, may request an opportunity to appear before the City Council to
comment upon the proposed refunds.
      (2)   An operator's liability for refunds is limited to a one-year
period, except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate order
issued by the city shall be liable for refunds commencing from the effective
date of such order until such time as it complies with such order.
      (3)   The refund portion shall run as follows:
         (a)   From the date the operator implements a prospective rate
reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one year, whichever is shorter.
         (b)   From the date the city issues an accounting order, and ending on
the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction ordered by the
city or one year, whichever is shorter.
      (4)   The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in
the following manner:
         (a)   By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid
the overcharges, either through direct payment or as specifically identified
credit to those subscribers' bills; or
         (b)   By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for
the basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative
overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-time
credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that currently
subscribe to the cable system.
      (5)   Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates
published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax
payments.

§ 112.146 MCS PROVIDERS CLASSIFIED AS CABLE OPERATORS; ADDITIONAL RULES.
   (A)   Generally. In addition to any requirements contained within this
chapter, all MCS providers that are classified as cable operators shall be
expected to abide by and comply with all applicable provisions of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984 and the Cable Television Consumer Protection
Act of 1992. A cable operator must provide the following information to
subscribers on monthly bills:
      (1)   A statement substantially the same as the following: “The basic
service tier rates and related equipment and installation charges are regulated
by the city. If you have any questions or comments regarding these rates, you
may call or write the city at P. O. Box 657, Cleburne, Texas 76033 (817) 645-
0901”; and
      (2)   The FCC community unit identifier for the cable system.
   (B)   Rates for the basic service tier.
      (1)   Basic service tier rates. Basic service tier rates are subject to
regulation by the city in order to assure that they are in compliance with the
requirements of 47 USC 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with
this chapter, not to exceed the Initial Permitted Per Channel Charge or the
Subsequent Permitted Per Channel Charge as described below, or the equipment
charges as specified in this chapter, will be accepted as in compliance. The
maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a
cable operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by
the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The
maximum monthly charges for the basic service tier shall not include any
charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations
are to be calculated separately pursuant to this chapter.
      (2)   Initial Permitted Per Channel Charge.
         (a)   For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for
the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice
to the cable operator that the city has been certified by the Commission to
regulate rates for the basic service tier and that this chapter has been
adopted by the city.
         (b)   For purposes of this section, rates in effect on the initial
date of regulation or in effect on September 30, 1992, shall be the rates
charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date.
          (c)   The permitted channel charge on the initial date of regulation
shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either:
            1.   A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding;
or
            2.   The charge specified in subdivisions a., b. or c. of this
subdivision, as applicable.
               a.   If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service
tier and equipment is equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as
adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial
regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel
charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment.
               b.   If the operator's channel charge for the basic service tier
and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the
benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September
30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and the operator's per channel
charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30,
1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge is nine-tenths of the per
channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark
per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30,
1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in
the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers.
               c.   If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service
tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the
benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September
30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and the operator's per channel
charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30,
1992, was below the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per
channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from
September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for
any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tier.
      (3)   Subsequent Permitted Per Channel Charge. After the initial date of
regulation, the permitted channel charge for the basic service tier shall be,
at the election of the cable operator, either:
         (a)   A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service
showing, or;
         (b)   The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by
the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the
price cap requirements set forth in division (B)(4) of this section.
      (4)   Price cap requirements.
         (a)   Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for the
basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation.
Adjustments permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be
based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index (GNP-PI) published
by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce.
         (b)   External costs. Permitted per channel charges for the basic
service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a
per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are
greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per channel charge
will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be increased if
external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than
inflation. Permitted per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of
external costs to the extent of such costs decrease from previous levels.
            1.   Categories. External costs shall consist of costs in the
following categories:
               a.   State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable
television service;
               b.   Franchise fees;
               c.   Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including
costs of providing public, educational, and governmental access channels as
required by the city. However, such costs shall not include the initial cost of
providing facilities and equipment required but not heretofore provided under a
Cable TV franchise in effect prior to the adoption of this chapter.
               d.   Retransmission consent fees; and
               e.   Programming costs.
            2.   The permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier
shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent
fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier.
            3.   The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for
costs of retransmission consent fees or charges in those fees incurred prior to
October 6, 1994.
            4.   The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs
for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation for 180 days
from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after
180 days from September 1, 1993.
            5.   Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to
permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as
part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier.
            6.   Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of
increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers shall be
the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased
by the amount of inflation.
            7.   Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of
increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any
revenues received by the operator from the programmer.
   (C)   Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service
tier.
      (1)   Scope.
         (a)   The equipment regulated under this section consists of all
equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service
tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive
other tiers or regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such
equipment shall include, but is not limited to:
            1.   Converter boxes;
            2.   Remote control units;
            3.   Connections for additional television receivers; and
            4.   Other cable home wiring.
         (b)   Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges
based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth below.
      (2)   Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote
control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation, and
additional connections separate from rates for basic service tier. In addition,
the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one from the
other.
      (3)   Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an Equipment
Basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer
equipment and installation under this section. Equipment Basket costs shall be
limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing,
leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment, as determined
in accordance with the cost account and cost allocation requirements of this
chapter. The Equipment Basket shall not include general administrative overhead
including general marketing expenses. The Equipment Basket may include a
reasonable profit.
       (4)   Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges
for equipment and installation using the Hourly Service Charge (HSC)
methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual Equipment Basket costs,
excluding the purchase costs of customer equipment, divided by the total person
hours involved in installing, repairing and servicing customer equipment during
the same period. The purchase of customer equipment shall include the cable
operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the
equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The HSC is calculated
according to the following formula:
         HSC =  EB - CE
             H
      Where   EB = annual Equipment Basket Cost;
            CE = annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and
            H = person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per
year.
      (5)   Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either:
         (a)   The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual
installation; or
         (b)   The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type
of installation.
      (6)   Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit
shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote
leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax,
financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to
the product of the HSC times the average number of hours annually repairing or
servicing a remote, divided by 12 to determine the monthly lease rate for a
remote according to the following formula:
         Monthly =  UCE + (HSC x HR)
         Charge    12
      Where   HR = average hours repair per year; and
            UCE = average annual unit cost of remote.
      Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different
type of remote control unit.
      (7)   Other equipment charges. The monthly charge for rental of converter
boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as
for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each
significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different
type of other customer equipment.
      (8)   Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and
monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated
with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels
determined by the actual cost methodology presented in the foregoing divisions
of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the
costs of signal boosters on the customers premises, if any, associated with the
additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional
connections.
      (9)   Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer
premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the
operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and
preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer,
plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the
maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a
service contract shall be the HSC times the estimated average number of hours
for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment.
      (10)    Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation
at charges below those determined under subdivisions (C)(5) through (7) of this
section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the
operator's overall offerings in the Equipment Basket and not unreasonably
discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by
increasing charges for other Equipment Basket elements, or by increasing
programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber
prescribed by this chapter. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an
operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead
costs.
      (11)    Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly
allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city.
   (D)   Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements.
      (1)   Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable for
purposes of rate adjustments on accounts of external costs for cost-of-service
showings.
      (2)   Generally accepted accounting principles. Cable operators shall
maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, except as otherwise directed in writing by the city.
      (3)   Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a
manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of
the city's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories
necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-
of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and
supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting
records.
      (4)   Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated below, cable
operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise,
system, regional, or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the
operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall
identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements,
franchise fees, local taxes, and local programming and shall maintain all
records as required by §
112.022.
      (5)   Cost allocation requirements.
         (a)   For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level,
cable operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregated at higher
levels to the franchise level based on the ratio of the total number of
subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers
served at the higher level.
         (b)   Except to the extent indicated below, all categories of costs
allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the
basic service tier based on the ratio of channels in the basic tier to the
total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated
and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each
tier of cable programming services based on the ratio of channels in that tier
to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area.
         (c)   Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees, however,
shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast
signal at issue is offered.
         (d)   Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment and
installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most
consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city.
         (e)   Costs of public, educational, and governmental access channels
carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where
possible.
      (6)   Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single
expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs
shall be allocated to expense categories as follows:
         (a)   Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service
cost categories based on direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves.
         (b)   When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if
possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost-
causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service
cost category.
         (c)   When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can
be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based
on the ratio of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost
category over total costs directly assignable and attributable.
      (7)   Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from
cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of basic service tier
and equipment, any direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the
provision of such services. Common costs of providing basic service tier and
equipment, and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in
accordance with Subdivision (D)(6) of this section.
      (8)   Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is divided
on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated with different
tiers or with pay-per-channel or pay-per-view service, a reasonable and
documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along
with the associated revenues and costs.
   (E)   Channel quantity and quality.
      (1)   Further, as an additional requirement, before the second
anniversary of the effective date of this chapter, any MCS provider classified
as a cable operator and providing cable service within the city shall have
designed and activated a multi-channel system with a minimum capability of
providing 60 full time video services.
      (2)   Further, the Council/franchising authority is committed that the
goal of the CCPA, as set forth in Section 601(4) of the Act, codified at 47 USC
521(4), is met at all times. As a result, the Council/franchising authority
expressly requires that upon the advent, implementation, and transmission of
high definition television (HDTV), its functional equivalent, or any
subsequently developed technological advancement affecting channel capacity or
needed bandwidth for any video programming source or service, the cable
operator shall not lessen, dilute, or decrease the mix, level, quality, or
quantity of programming services carried on the cable system for reasons of
lack of adequate channel capacity.

Penalty, see § 112.999
§ 112.147 MCS PROVIDERS CLASSIFIED AS CABLE OPERATORS; SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL
PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND GOVERNMENTAL RULES.
   (A)   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 611 of
the CCPA, codified at 47 USC 531, the Council/franchising authority has certain
power with respect to certain aspects for public, educational, or governmental
(PEG) use which is provided by MCS providers classified as cable operators.
   (B)   To the extent permitted by law, and in order to fulfill the Council/
franchising authority's desired goal of a public, educational, and governmental
(PEG) access policy that will facilitate the long-range needs of the city, the
Council/franchising authority adopts the following:
      (1)   At the time of an initial application for an MCS franchise for a
cable system, and contained within any renewal franchise agreement, an MCS
provider classified as a cable operator shall pledge to include the following
guarantees:
         (a)   An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provider,
at its own expense, one 12 hour educational channel; and
         (b)   An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at
its own expense, one 12 hour governmental channel that is available for
providing coverage of Council meetings and other related programming offered or
designed by the City Manager, or designated official, including department
heads; and
         (c)   An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at
its own expense, one 12 hour public access channel that is available for use by
various community groups and organizations.
         (d)   Such requirements may not require three separate channels;
rather, that sufficient channel capacity exists at any time to accommodate the
needs of the users of the PEG channels.
      (2)   Both the Council/franchising authority and the affected cable
operator shall review use after every six months, including the percentage of
use of every PEG channel. At the end of each six month period, the Council/
franchising authority shall evaluate the response and actual use of such
channels. If, after any six month period, the percentage of use for any
required PEG channel drops below 25% of the total time allocated, then the
required number of hours shall be reduced to a number that most closely
approximates the average hours of use per day. If the Council/franchising
authority determines the average hours of use per day for any required PEG
channel is less than four hours, then the requirement for that channel's
availability may be affirmatively waived by resolution, and an affected cable
operator may use such channel for any lawful purpose during the period of
waiver, which may be ended at any time by repeal of the resolution granting the
waiver, and upon a finding that demand for the PEG channel has increased beyond
the time allocated.
      (3)   If, at any time, 90% of the total time allocated for any required
PEG channel is consistently used five days a week for a period of six months,
then the cable operator shall provide an additional PEG channel.
      (4)   A cable operator is required to provide both mobile, portable, and
stationary equipment to be used for PEG access, together with the aid of
technical and production assistance provided by the cable operator. A cable
operator is required to provide equipment that can store programs for delayed
cablecasting and to provide delayed cablecasting. There will be no cost for
technical production assistance for PEG access use to any one user provided
that a single use does not exceed 50 actual production man-hours. Moreover, the
cost of maintenance of a PEG access studio and equipment required to run the
studio shall be borne by the cable operator.
   (C)   Costs of franchise requirements.
      (1)   The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public,
educational, and governmental channel shall consist of the sum of:
         (a)   All per channel costs for the number of channels used to meet
franchise requirements for public, educational, and governmental channels;
         (b)   Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and
         (c)   A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead.
      (2)   The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise
shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including a reasonable
allocation of general and administrative costs.
(Ord. 4-1994-20, passed 4-12-94)
§ 112.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Criminal penalties.
      (1)   Any violation or failure to abide by and comply with any provision
or requirement of this chapter shall be a violation of city ordinance, and
shall be punished as a Class C Misdemeanor, subject to a fine up to $500 per
occurrence, unless otherwise provided by state law.
      (2)   Each day upon which there exists a violation of this chapter, or a
failure to abide by or comply with any provision or requirement of this
chapter, shall constitute a separate occurrence, and may subject the MCS
provider to separate criminal penalties.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Civil penalties may be imposed for the violation of any provision
of this chapter, as follows:
         (a)   Up to $200 for each violation, and each day of a continuing
violation may be considered, a new violation; and/or
         (b)   If applicable, default and revocation of a franchise granted
pursuant to this chapter, subject however, to the procedural guidelines noted
in this chapter and any franchise or licensee which applies to the provider,
and further subject to any limitations imposed by federal or state law.
      (2)   Monetary civil penalties may be imposed in the manner prescribed by
either local or state law.

§ 117.02 PERMITS FOR TAXICAB BUSINESS.
   (A)   No permit to operate a taxicab business shall be issued by the City
Secretary until the Council shall, after a hearing duly had, find that the
public convenience and necessity requires the proposed taxicab service for
which application for permits is made; provided, however, that such declaration
of public convenience and necessity shall not be necessary in the following
instances:
      (1)   For the authorizing of the same number of taxicabs authorized for
operation and operated by applicant under the same name on the date of the
passage of this subchapter, or the renewal of the same number of permits
annually thereafter, provided that such permits as have become invalid for
nonuser, as hereinafter provided, shall not be renewed.
      (2)   For the renewal of permits to the applicant for the number of
taxicabs for which the Council shall have approved at any time prior to the
application for such renewal; provided, however, that said taxicab owner shall
renew permit at the time of the expiration date appearing on permit now being
used.
   (B)   In determining whether public convenience and necessity requires the
authorizing of such taxicabs for which application may be made, the Council
shall take into consideration whether the demands for public convenience and
necessity require such proposed or additional taxicab service within the city;
the financial and moral responsibility and character of the applicant; the
number, kind, type and ownership of equipment, and the color scheme to be used
by the applicant, the increased traffic congestion of the streets of the city
which may result and whether the demands for public convenience and necessity
require such proposed or additional taxicab service within the city, both
vehicular and pedestrian, will be unduly endangered by the granting of such
additional permit; and such other relevant facts as the Council may deem
advisable or necessary which may throw light on the public necessity and
convenience.
   (C)   Any applicant for a taxicab permit to operate as a business shall, as
hereinafter provided, make application in writing accompanied by a financial
statement and show whether the applicant has ever been charged or convicted in
any court for any offense under any city or state or federal law and such
application shall be signed and sworn to by the applicant. (This does not apply
if for renewal where permit is valid.) Such additional information as the
Council may require shall be furnished. Such application shall be considered at
the second regular meeting of the Council following the filing of the
application and all interested parties shall be heard by the Council at such
meeting. In all such hearings the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant
to establish by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that the public
convenience and necessity requires such operation of the vehicle or vehicles
for which such application has been made. Renewal permits will be issued upon
an application made to the City Secretary by the holder of a permit of the
previous year or expiration of date permit was issued. Notice of public hearing
shall be published in a local newspaper at least 15 days prior to the hearing.
   (D)   If the Council finds from its investigation and hearing that a public
convenience and necessity justified the operation of the vehicle or vehicles
for which said permit is desired, it shall instruct the City Secretary to issue
a permit to the applicant for the taxicab or taxicabs upon a compliance by the
applicant with all the provisions of this subchapter.
   (E)   No permit issued under the terms of this subchapter shall be
transferred to any other person, except with the written consent of the
Council, and shall not be used for the operation as a taxicab of any vehicle
except a vehicle owned or under the control of the holder of the permit.
   (F)   The permit issued for the operation of a taxicab under the terms of
this subchapter shall be posted within said taxicab in a conspicuous place and
a failure to so post said permit shall be a violation of this subchapter.
   (G)   All taxicab permits shall be valid until January 1 of the next ensuing
year following the date they are issued; and all taxicab permits issued during
any year shall expire on December 31 of such year, and must be renewed on
January 1 of the following year in the manner hereinbefore provided and said
permit shall be signed by the City Secretary of the city.

   (A)   Before any permit shall be issued to any owner of any taxicab as
hereinbefore defined or before any renewal or permit shall be granted, the
owner shall be required to file with the City Secretary, and to thereafter keep
in full force and effect, a policy of public liability insurance executed by an
insurance company duly authorized to do business in the state and performable
in the county and to be approved by the Council, insuring the public against
any loss or damage that may result to any person, persons or property in the
operation of such vehicle or vehicles and provided that the maximum amount of
recovery in such policy of insurance shall not, as to each and every vehicle,
be less than $10,000 for injury or death of one person; and not less than
$20,000 for injury or death for more than one person in any one accident; and
not less than $5,000 for the injury to or destruction of property in any one
accident.
   (B)   The public liability policy shall further provide that no action shall
lie thereon against the insurance company until after a final judgment in favor
of the injured or damaged person or persons, and against the owner of the
taxicab, not pending an appeal or writ of error, is, and remains unsatisfied.
   (C)   In the event that the Council shall determine, after a hearing duly
had, and after three days' notice given a permit holder, that any insurance
given by a permit owner has become impaired, so as to afford less protection to
the public than was originally filed, it may require a new or additional
policy, so as to bring the protection of said insurance to its original amount,
and the permit holder shall, within five days after receiving written notice of
such requirement, provided the required new or additional policy, failing
which, the permit of said permit holder shall automaticallY terminate. In the
event that any insurer may desire to be released from any policy, he may give
written notice of such desire to the Council at least ten days before he
desires his liability released, and the Council shall thereupon, by personal
delivery or by mail, give written notice to any such permit owner and demand
that such owner furnish new insurance by the expiration of the ten-day period
provided for, and shall discharge such first insurer from any liability which
shall accrue after the time of approval of such new policy that said permit
holder may file, or shall discharge such first insurer after the expiration of
the ten-day period.
   (D)   In the event any policy be so cancelled, upon the request of the
insurer, and no new policy is filed by said permit holder before the
cancellation of said original insurance, then the permit to operate taxicabs
granted to said permit holder shall be automatically revoked; neither the city
nor any officer thereof shall be held liable for the pecuniary responsibility
of solvency of any such insurer, or in any manner become liable for any sum on
account of any such claim or act of omission relating to any such taxicab, nor
shall the liability of any person owning or operating any such taxicab be in
any manner limited or changed in connection with this subchapter or such permit
or insurance.

shall be issued, the City Secretary shall examine the tax records and ascertain
whether or not ad valorem taxes assessed by the city against the vehicle and
other equipment to be used in the business of the applicant have been fully
paid. If the ad valorem taxes have not been paid, the City Secretary shall
refuse to issue the applicant such permit or renewal until all of the ad
valorem taxes have been paid and all other provisions of this subchapter have
been complied with by applicant, and the City Secretary shall issue to the
applicant a permit or renewal thereof for each and every vehicle to which he
may be entitled.

city to render or cause to be rendered for ad valorem taxes to the city all
vehicles or other equipment used in such business, and a failure to render for
and to pay such ad valorem taxes to the city before they become delinquent

authorizing the operation over the public streets, alleys and ways of the city
of any such taxicabs.

complaint to such permit holder against whom complaint is made, hear evidence
of such complaint, and after such hearing the Council may revoke or suspend the

of a size and design approved by the chief of police and such taximeter shall
conform to the following specifications:
      (1)   The taximeter shall be a mechanical instrument or device by which
the charge for hire of a taxicab is mechanically calculated for distance
traveled, for waiting time, if any, and upon which much charge or charges shall
be indicated by means of clearly legible figures which are electrically lighted
each time the taximeter flag is thrown from the nonearning to earning position.
      (2)   Every taximeter must register upon visual counters the following
items:
         (a)   Total miles, unless shown by accurate registration on the
speedometer, tested and in good working order, on the taxicab.
         (b)   Paid miles.

automatically lighted, between sunset and sunrise, and when. the taximeter flag
is on “mileage” or “time,” both of which are earning positions an amber “tell-
tale” light of the top light will be automatically lighted at all times.
Provided that any taxicab not having a taximeter at the time of the passage of
this subchapter [i.e., April 9, 1974] be given time to install these no later
than June 1, 1974.
   (C)   A current schedule of all rates and fares charged by the owner shall
always be on file with the City Secretary. The holder may from time to time
propose changes in those rates and fares by filing such proposed rates and
fares with the City Secretary for consideration of the City Council and left on
file for a period of 15 days. If, within that period, the same have been
approved or have not been acted upon by the City Council, in whole or in part,
the whole or part so approved, or so not acted upon shall take effect, as
proposed; provided, however, the City Council shall have the right, by
resolution duly passed, to extend the time for action upon such proposed

§ 118.04 WELL SETBACKS.
   (A)   (1)   It shall be unlawful to drill any well, the center of which, at
the surface of the ground, is located:
         (a)   Within 25 feet of any storage tank or source of ignition;
         (b)   Within 75 feet of any public street, road, highway or future
street, right-of-way or property line;
         (c)   Within 100 feet of any building accessory to, but not necessary
to the operation of the well;
         (d)   Within 300 feet of any fresh water well;
         (e)   Within 400 feet of any industrial building; or
         (f)   Within 600 feet of any protected use.
      (2)   This provision applies to any existing protected use or industrial
building, or where a building permit has been issued for a protected use or an
industrial building on the date the application for a permit under this chapter
is filed with the city.
   (B)   The distances referred to in §
118.04(A)(1) through (6) above shall be calculated from the well bore, in a
straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects to the
closest exterior point of any object or boundary listed in divisions (1)
through (6) above.
   (C)   The distances set out in §
118.04(A)(5) and (6) may be reduced in accordance with  §
118.05(C), but never to less than 200 feet from a protected use or industrial
building, by:
      (1)   A waiver granted by the City Council; or
      (2)   Written notarized waivers granted by the owners of protected use
property within a 600-foot radius around the proposed well, or by the owners of
any industrial building within a 400-foot radius around the proposed well. All
waivers must identify the property address, block and lot number, subdivision
name (if applicable), plat volume and page, and must be filed, at the expense
of the operator, in the applicable county records prior to the application for
the permit.

Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.05 PERMITS; ISSUANCE OR REFUSAL TO ISSUE.
   (A)   Within 30 days after the filing of the application for a permit, the
City Manager shall determine whether or not the application complies in all
respects with the provisions of this chapter, if the proposed drill site meets
the distance setbacks specified in §
118.04, and if the drill site is not crossed by any public streets or roads. If
the application complies with such provisions, the City Manager shall issue a
permit authorizing the drilling of the well(s) or the installation of the
facilities applied for.
   (B)   If the City Manager determines that a permit application should be
denied for reasons other than lack of a required distance setback as set out in
§
118.04 for the requested permit, the City Manager shall notify the operator in
writing of such denial, stating the reasons for the denial. Within 30 days of
the date of the written decision of the City Manager to deny the permit, the
operator may:
      (1)   Cure those conditions that caused the denial, and resubmit the
application to the City Manager for approval and issuance of the permit; or
      (2)   File an appeal to the City Council under the provisions outlined in
§ 118.22  of this chapter.
   (C)   If, however, the City Manager determines that all of the provisions of
these regulations have been complied with by the operator, but that the
proposed drill site does not meet the distance setbacks specified in §
118.04, then the City Manager shall place the application on the agenda of the
City Council, which shall hold a public hearing on such application, after
giving notice at least one time by publication in the official newspaper at
least ten days prior to the hearing, and in writing by regular United States
mail to the surface owners of real property within 600 feet of the proposed
drill site. Such notice is not necessary to any property owner within the 600-
foot radius that executes and files with the City Secretary a written waiver
acknowledged before a notary public, as specified in  §
 118.04.
   (D)   Written notices may be served by depositing the same, properly
addressed and postage paid, in the city post office to the owners at the
addresses as shown on the last approved city tax roll, or as shown in the
application pursuant to §
118.03(C) if the latter is different from the tax roll.
   (E)   The City Council shall review the application and any other related
information. The City Council shall consider the following in deciding whether
to grant a permit:
       (1)   Whether the operations proposed are reasonable under the
circumstances and conditions prevailing in the area, considering the particular
location and the character of the improvements located there;
      (2)   Whether the drilling of such wells would conflict with the orderly
growth and development of the city;
      (3)   Whether there are other alternative well site locations;
      (4)   Whether the operations proposed are consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of the public, when and if conducted in accordance with the
permit conditions to be imposed;
      (5)   Whether there is accessible access for the city fire personnel and
firefighting equipment; and
      (6)   Whether the impact upon the adjacent property and the general
public by operations conducted in compliance with the conditions of the
proposed permit are reasonable and justified, balancing the following factors:
         (a)   The right of the owners(s) of the mineral estate to explore,
develop and produce the minerals; and
         (b)   The availability of alternative drill sites.
   (F)   Following the public hearing, the City Council may grant the permit
upon such terms and conditions as it determines to be necessary to protect the
public health and safety. The requirement for the well to be 600 feet from a
protected use or 400 feet from an industrial building may be reduced, but never
to less than 200 feet by: (1) a waiver granted by the City Council; or (2)
written notarized waivers granted by all protected use property owners within
600 feet, or written notarized waivers granted by all industrial building
owners within 400 feet, in accordance with §
118.04. For the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, the City
Council may impose additional requirements for a reduction of such distance
setbacks.
   (G)   The burden of proof on all matters considered at the hearing shall be
upon the applicant/operator.
   (H)   The City Council may require an increase in the distance the well is
set back from any protected use or industrial building, or require any change
in the operation, plan, design, layout, or on-site and technical regulations of
this chapter, including fencing, screening, landscaping, lighting, delivery
times, noise levels, tank height, or any other matters reasonably required by
the public interest.
   (I)   In the interest of securing compliance with this chapter, the city
code, and/or to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community, the
City Council may accept, reject or modify the application. In making its
decision, the City Council shall have the power and authority to refuse any
permit to drill any well at any particular location within the city, when by
reason of such particular location and other characteristics, the drilling of
such well at such particular location would be injurious to the health, safety
or welfare of the inhabitants in the immediate area of the city. The decision
of the City Council shall be final.
   (J)   Each permit shall:
      (1)   By reference have incorporated therein all the provisions of this
chapter with the same force and effect as if this chapter were copied verbatim
in such permit.
      (2)   Specify the location of the proposed drill site, well or injection
facility, with particularity to lot number, block number, name of addition or
subdivision or by a metes and bounds description, or other available correct
legal description.
      (3)   Specify the routes and roads to be used by vehicles, equipment,
chemicals or waste products used or produced in oil or gas well drilling or
operations, and in servicing wells.
      (4)   Contain and specify that the term of the permit shall automatically
terminate, unless extended, if drilling is not commenced within 180 days from
the date of the permit, and so long thereafter as oil and gas is produced, or
until such time as the permittee has permanently abandoned the operation of
such well or facility for which the permit was issued.
      (5)   Contain and specify such other terms and provisions as may be
necessary in a particular case to accomplish the purpose of this chapter.
      (6)   Contain and specify that no actual operations shall be commenced
until the operator has complied with the bond and insurance provisions of this
chapter.
      (7)    Require that the operator promptly restore to its former condition
any public property damaged by the oil or gas operation.
      (8)   Pursuant to this chapter, each permit issued by the City Manager or
the City Council shall include the following language:
“Operator does hereby expressly release and discharge all claims, demands,
actions, judgments and executions it ever had, or now has or may have, or
assigns it may have or claim to have, against the City of Cleburne and/or its
departments, agents, officers, servants, successors, assigns, sponsors,
volunteers or employees, created by, or arising out of personal injuries, known
or unknown, and injuries to property, real or personal, or in any way
incidental to or in connection with the performance of the work performed by
the operator under a permit issued pursuant to this chapter. The operator shall
fully defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the City of Cleburne, Texas,
its departments, agents, officers, servants, employees, successors, assigns,
sponsors or volunteers, from and against each and every claim, demand or cause
of action, and any and all liability, damages, obligations, judgments, losses,
fines, penalties, costs, fees and expenses incurred in defense of the City of
Cleburne, Texas, its departments, agents, officers, servants or employees,
including without limitation, personal injuries and death in connection
therewith, which may be made or asserted by operator, its agents, assigns or
any third parties on account of, arising out of, or in any way incidental to or
in connection with the performance of the work performed by the operator under
a permit issued pursuant to this chapter. The operator agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the City of Cleburne, Texas, its departments, officers, agents,
servants, employees, successors, assigns, sponsors or volunteers, from any
liabilities or damages suffered as a result of claims, demands, costs or
judgments against the city, its departments, its officers, agents, servants or
employees, created by, or arising out of the acts or omissions of the City of
Cleburne occurring on the drill site or operation site in the course and scope
of inspecting and permitting the gas wells, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
CLAIMS AND DAMAGES ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE
CITY OF CLEBURNE OCCURRING ON THE DRILL SITE OR OPERATION SITE IN THE COURSE
AND SCOPE OF INSPECTING AND PERMITTING THE GAS WELLS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND
AGREED THAT THE INDEMNITY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION IS AN INDEMNITY EXTENDED
BY THE OPERATOR TO INDEMNIFY AND PROTECT THE CITY OF CLEBURNE, TEXAS AND/OR ITS
DEPARTMENT, AGENTS, OFFICERS, SERVANTS OR EMPLOYEES FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF
THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE CITY OF CLEBURNE, TEXAS, AND/OR ITS DEPARTMENTS, AGENTS,
OFFICERS, SERVANTS, OR EMPLOYEES, WHETHER THAT NEGLIGENCE IS THE SOLE OR
CONTRIBUTING CAUSE OF THE RESULTANT INJURY, DEATH AND/OR DAMAGE.”
   (K)   Within 15 days after the City Manager or the City Council has granted
a permit, the City Secretary shall publish a notice of the granting of such
permit one time in the official newspaper of the city.

Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.06 BOND AND INSURANCE.
   (A)   Prior to the issuance of a gas well permit the operator shall provide
the city with a security instrument in the form of a bond as follows:
      (1)   A bond shall be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance
institution authorized to do business in Texas, acceptable to the city. The
bond shall become effective on or before the date the gas well permit is issued
and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after
the expiration of the gas well permit term or until the well is plugged and
abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs first. The operator shall
be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee,
and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and
regulations of this division (A) and the gas well permit, and further
conditioned that the operator will repair any damages to the city roads,
streets, or utilities, as determined by the Director of Public Works of the
city, caused by the use of heavy vehicles and equipment for any activity
associated with the preparation, drilling, fracing, production, and operation
of gas wells.
      (2)   The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000
for any single well. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond shall
be maintained at $50,000.
      (3)   An operator drilling or reworking between one and five wells at any
given time, may elect to provide a blanket bond, in the principal minimum
amount of $150,000. If the operator drills or reworks more than five wells at a
time, the blanket bond shall be increased in increments of $50,000 per each
additional well. Once the wells are in the producing stage and all drilling
operations have ceased, the operator may elect to submit a request to the City
Manager for approval to reduce the existing bond and provide a blanket bond for
the remainder of the time the well produces, without reworking, as follows:
 
Number of Producing Wells Blanket Bond Amount Required
Up to 75 wells            $200,000
75 to 150 wells           $250,000
More than 150 wells       $300,000
 
   If at any time after no less than a 15 day written notice to the operator
and a public hearing, the City Council shall deem any operator's bond to be
insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond up
to a maximum of $350,000 per well.
      (4)   Whenever the city finds that a default has occurred in the
performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this division (A) or the
gas well permit, a written notice shall be given to the operator. Such notice
shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time
deemed by the city to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work.
After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein
specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do
so, shall pay to the city 125% of the estimated cost of doing the work as set
forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than
30 days unless in the sole opinion of the Director of Public Works the failure
presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or
unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports
as required by this division (A). The city shall be authorized to draw against
any bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such
monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the
required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred
other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well
has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the Commission, such
additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly
plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the
regulations of this division (A).
      (5)   In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed
and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to
be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument
refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable bond, the city
may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action
against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both
such methods.
      (6)   When the well or wells covered by said bond have been properly
abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this division (A), and in
conformity with all regulations of the Commission and notice to that effect has
been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the
bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and
cancelled.
   (B)   In addition to the bond required above, the operator shall carry a
policy or policies of standard comprehensive public liability insurance,
including contractual liability coverage, for accidental death, bodily injury
and property damage, naming both the operator and city as insureds, with an
insurance company authorized to do business in the state and appearing on the
list of authorized insurance companies prepared by the State Board of
Insurance. Such policy or policies in the aggregate shall provide for the
following minimum coverages:
      (1)   Accidental death or bodily injury, $5,000,000 one person and
$5,000,000 total for one accident;
      (2)   Property damage, $1,000,000 total for one accident.
   (C)   The operator shall file with the City Secretary a certificate of
insurance, showing compliance with the above, prior to receiving a copy or
copies of the permit or commencing any operations on the drill site. The
insurance shall not be canceled without written notice to the City Secretary at
least ten days prior to the effective date of such cancellation. In the event
such insurance is canceled, the permit granted in connection with such policy
or policies shall be suspended and ineffective until the operator files
additional insurance as provided herein.

§ 118.07 SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF PERMIT; EFFECT.
   (A)   If an operator (or its officers, employees, agents, contractors or
representatives) fails to comply with any requirement of a permit issued
pursuant to this chapter (including any requirement incorporated by reference
as part of the permit), the City Manager shall give written notice to the
operator, specifying the nature of the failure and giving the operator a
reasonable time to cure, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the
failure, the extent of the efforts required to cure, and the potential impact
on the health, safety and welfare of the community. In no event, however, shall
the cure period be less than 30 days, unless the failure presents a risk of
imminent destruction of property or injury to persons, or involves the
operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this chapter.
   (B)   If the operator fails to correct the noncompliance within 30 days from
the date of the notice, the City Manager may suspend or revoke the permit
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   No person shall carry on any operations performed under the terms of
the permit issued under this chapter during any period of any permit suspension
or revocation, or pending a review of the decision or order of the city in
suspending or revoking the permit. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
to prevent the necessary, diligent and bona fide efforts to cure and remedy the
default or violation for which the suspension or revocation of the permit was
ordered for the safety of persons or as required by the Commission.
   (D)   If the operator does not cure the noncompliance within the time
specified in this chapter, the City Manager, upon written notice to the
operator, may notify the Commission and request that it take any appropriate
action.
   (E)   Within 30 days of the date of the decision of the City Manager, in
writing, to suspend or revoke a permit, the operator may file an appeal to the
City Council under the provisions outlined in §
118.20 of this chapter.
   (F)   If an application for a permit is denied by the City Manager, nothing
contained herein shall prevent a new permit application from being submitted to
the City Manager for the same well.

§ 118.08 AMENDED PERMITS.
   (A)   An operator may submit an application to the City Secretary to amend
an existing permit, to commence drilling from a new drill site that is not
shown on (or incorporated by reference as part of) the existing permit, to
relocate a drill site or operation site that is shown on (or incorporated by
reference as part of) the existing permit, or to otherwise amend the existing
permit.
   (B)   Applications for amended permits shall be in writing and signed by the
operator, and shall include the following:
      (1)   The fee for filing the application to amend the permit in the
amount of $2,500;
      (2)   A description of the proposed amendments;
      (3)   Any changes to the information submitted with the application for
the existing permit (if such information has not previously been provided to
the city);
      (4)   Such additional information as is reasonably required by the City
Manager to demonstrate compliance with the applicable permit; and
      (5)   Such additional information as is reasonably required by the City
Manager to prevent imminent destruction of property or injury to persons.
   (C)   All applications for amended permits filed with the City Secretary
shall be forwarded to the City Manager for review. Incomplete applications may
be returned to the applicant, in which case the city shall provide a written
explanation of the deficiencies; however, the city shall retain the application
fee. The city may return any application as incomplete if there is a dispute
pending before the Railroad Commission regarding the determination of the
operator.
   (D)   If the activities proposed by the amendment are not materially
different from the activities covered by the existing permit, and if the
proposed activities are in conformance with the applicable permit, then the
City Manager shall approve the amendment within ten days after the application
is filed.
   (E)   If the activities proposed by the amendment are materially different
from the activities covered by the existing permit, and if the proposed
activities are in conformance with the applicable permit, then the City Manager
shall approve the amendment within 30 days after the application is filed. If,
however, the activities proposed by the amendment are materially different and,
in the judgment of the City Manager, might create a risk of imminent
destruction of property or injury to persons not associated with the activities
covered by the existing permit, or not otherwise taken into consideration by
the existing permit, the City Manager may require the amendment to be processed
as a new permit application.
   (F)   The failure of the City Manager to review and issue an amended permit
within the time limits specified above shall not cause the application for the
amended permit to be deemed approved.
   (G)   The decision of the City Manager to deny an amendment to a permit
shall be provided to the operator in writing, within ten days after the
decision, including an explanation of the basis for the decision. The operator
may appeal any such denial to the City Council.

towing fee for an additional truck if the scene requires an additional tow
truck and the officer in charge of the scene consents to the tow company’s

a public hospital or church shall be measured in a direct line from the front
door of the place of business. The notice area for a variance request relating
to a public or private school shall be measured in a direct line from the

assembly. An approved air gap shall be located at the relief valve orifice of
RP assemblies.
         (c)   No part of a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly shall be submerged in water or installed in a location subject to
flooding. RPs are typically installed above grade in well drained areas, but
may be installed below grade (ground level) if a boresight drain to daylight is
provided. The drain shall be of adequate capacity to carry the full rated flow
of the assembly and shall be screened on both ends.
         (d)   Enclosures shall be designed for ready access and sized to allow
for the minimum clearances established below. Removable protective enclosures
are typically installed on the smaller assemblies. Daylight drain ports must be
provided to accommodate full pressure discharge from the assembly.
         (e)   Assemblies 2 inches and smaller shall have at least 6 inch
clearance on both sides and on top of the assembly, and 12 inches below and
behind the assembly. All assemblies larger than 2 inches shall have a minimum
of 12 inches on the back side, 24 inches on the test cock side, and the relief
valve opening shall be at least 12 inches plus nominal size of assembly above

section. Tests are the responsibility of the assembly owner. The owner must
notify the regulatory authority upon installation of any backflow prevention
assembly.
         (g)   Variances from these specifications will be evaluated on a case-
by-case basis. Any deviations must have prior written approval of the
regulatory authority.
      (2)   Reduced pressure principle detector backflow prevention assemblies
(RPDA). May be utilized in all installations requiring a reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly and detector metering.
         (a)   RPDAs shall comply with the installation requirements applicable

utilized at premises where a substance is handled that would be objectionable
but no hazardous to health if introduced into the potable water system.
         (a)   DCs must be sized to provide an adequate supply of water and
pressure for premises being served. Consult manufacturer's specifications for
specific performance data.
         (b)   Premises where an uninterrupted water supply is critical should
be provided with two assemblies installed in parallel. Assemblies should be
sized in such a manner that either assembly will provide the minimum water
requirements while the two together will provide the maximum flow required.
         (c)   The assembly shall be readily accessible with adequate room for
testing and maintenance. DCs may be installed below grade, providing all test

         (b)   New irrigation systems shall not utilize above-ground spray
emission devices in landscapes that are less than 48 inches not including the
impervious surfaces in either length or width and which contain impervious
pedestrian or vehicular traffic surfaces along two or more perimeters. If pop-
up sprays or rotary sprinkler heads are used in a new irrigation system, the
sprinkler heads must direct flow away from any adjacent surface and shall not
be installed closer than four inches from a hardscape, such as, but not limited
to, a building foundation, fence, concrete, asphalt, pavers, or stones set with
mortar.
         (c)   Narrow paved walkways, jogging paths, golf cart paths or other
small areas located in cemeteries, parks, golf courses or other public areas
may be exempted from this requirement if the runoff drains into a landscaped
area.
      (3)   Water pressure. Emission devices must be installed to operate at
the minimum and not above the maximum sprinkler head pressure as published by
the manufacturer for the nozzle and head spacing that is used. Methods to
achieve the water pressure requirements include, but are not limited to, flow

         (a)   If the manufacturer has not published specifications for depth
coverage of piping, the piping must be installed to provide minimum depth
coverage of six inches of select backfill, between the top of the pipe and the
natural grade of the topsoil. All portions of the irrigation system that fail
to meet this standard must be noted on the irrigation plan. If the area being
irrigated has rock at a depth of six inches or less, select backfill may be
mounded over the pipe. Mounding must be noted on the irrigation plan and
discussed with the irrigation system owner or owner's representative to address
any safety issues.
         (b)   If a utility, man-made structure or roots create an unavoidable
obstacle, which makes the six-inch depth coverage requirement impractical, the
piping shall be installed to provide a minimum of two inches of select backfill
between the top of the pipe and the natural grade of the topsoil.
         (c)   All trenches and holes created during installation of an

      (14)   Water contained within the piping of an irrigation system is
deemed to be non-potable. No drinking or domestic water usage, such as, but not
limited to, filling swimming pools or decorative fountains, shall be connected
to an irrigation system. If a hose bib (an outdoor water faucet that has hose
threads on the spout) is connected to an irrigation system for the purpose of
providing supplemental water to an area, the hose bib must be installed using a
quick coupler key on a quick coupler installed in a covered purple valve box
and the hose bib and any hoses connected to the bib must be labeled "non
potable, not safe for drinking." An isolation valve must be installed upstream
of a quick coupler connecting a hose bib to an irrigation system.
      (15)   Beginning January 1, 2010, either a licensed irrigator or a
licensed irrigation technician shall be on-site at all times while the
landscape irrigation system is being installed. When an irrigator is not
onsite, the irrigator shall be responsible for ensuring that a licensed

§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Texas Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
government units to adapt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City of Cleburne, Texas does ordain as follows:
(Am. Ord. 11-2012-68, passed 11-29-12)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Cleburne are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
('68 Code, § 6-71) (Ord. 3-1987-20, passed 3-10-87; Am. Ord. 11- 2012-68,
passed 11-29-12)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood-
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
('68 Code, § 6-72) (Ord. 3-1987-20, passed 3-10-87; Am. Ord. 11- 2012-68,
passed 11-29-12)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other developments which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
('68 Code, § 6-73) (Ord. 3-1987-20, passed 3-10-87; Am. Ord. 11- 2012-68,
passed 11-29-12)

flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, “new construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on

tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. See AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, being Pub. L. 97-348,
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that altertaion affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before”start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or
other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10),
(d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations, is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum where specified) of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine

§ 151.12 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city or any official or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local
governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is
required.
      (5)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example: where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation.
      (6)   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency which is Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), and also the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (7)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      (8)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with §
151.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source in order to administer the provisions of §
151.14.
      (9)   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain
Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and
AE on the City's FIRM unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
      (10)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community’s FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that
the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.
   (C)   Permit procedures.
      (1)   Application for a Floodplain Development Permit shall be presented
to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include,
but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
         (a)   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new substantially improved structures;
         (b)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;

architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the
floodproofing criteria of §
151.14(B)(2);
         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
         (e)   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
division (B)(1) above.
      (2)   Approval or denial of a Floodplain Development Permit by the
Floodplain Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this
chapter and the following relevant factors:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (b)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (c)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (d)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (e)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (f)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         (g)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         (h)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where
applicable;
         (i)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to the
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         (j)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area.
   (D)   Variance procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment as established by the Council of the city
shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements
of this chapter.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and render judgment on any
appeal only when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Adjustment may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
      (5)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in division (C)(2) of this section
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (7)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of
this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may attached such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this chapter set forth in §
151.03.
      (8)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (9)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (10)   Prerequisite for granting variances:
         (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon showing a good and
sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
         (c)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (11)   Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria outlined in divisions
(1) through (10) above are met and the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety.

151.99
§ 151.14 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the
following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial
improvements:
      (1)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
      (2)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      (4)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation;
      (5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of, flood waters into the system;
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
      (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in §§
151.07,
151.13(B)(8), or division (C)(4) of this section, the following provisions are
required:
      (1)   Residential construction.  New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated to at least two feet above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this
division as proposed in §
151.13(C)(1)(a) is satisfied.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure,
including attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, shall either have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of two feet above the
base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the
construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are
in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this division.
A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be
maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Enclosures.  New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding, shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   Manufactured homes.
         (a)   All manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a
community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
         (b)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites (i)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred ‘substantial damage’ as a
result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         (c)   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with
Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the
provisions of division (B)(4) of this section be elevated so that either:
            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is two feet above
the base flood elevation; and
            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         (d)   Prohibit the placement of any manufactured housing within the
areas which have been identified as regulatory floodways.
      (5)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM either (i) be on
the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and
ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of Article 4,
Section C(1) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured
homes” in division (B)(4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
   (C)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall be consistent with §§
151.02 through
151.04.
      (2)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet Floodplain Development
Permit requirements of §§
151.08,
151.13(C), and the provisions of this section.
      (3)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser,
if not otherwise provided pursuant to §§
151.07 or division (B)(8) of this section.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage.
   (D)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within
the areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.07 of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of two
feet above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor (including basement and attendant utility
and sanitary facilities) elevated to a minimum of two feet above the base flood
elevation.
      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
151.13(C)(1)(a), are satisfied.
      (4)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (E)   Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood hazards
established in §
151.07 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
      (1)    Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If division (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
      (3)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit
encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes
all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.

order and other application regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court
order or fails to comply with any of the requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500 for each violation, and in addition shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall
prevent Cleburne from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.

reason must be directly related to the requirements under this chapter. The
statement shall include a citation to the requirement under this chapter, other
ordinance, or statute, if applicable.
   (J)   Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the
final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout
submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final
plat.
   (K)   In its action on the preliminary plat, the Commission shall consider
the physical arrangement of the subdivision, determine the adequacy of street

a final plat of any portion of the preliminary plat;
         (b)   The subdivider demonstrates progress towards completion of the
project as defined in Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 245.005. The preliminary plat will
remain valid and in effect as long as the subdivider continues to demonstrate
progress towards completion; or
         (c)   If a final plat has not been approved and progress towards
completion has not occurred, and the preliminary plat has not expired, the
subdivider may request an extension of preliminary plat approval.
            1.   If the Planning and Zoning Coordinator finds that no material
revisions are necessary for the approved preliminary plat to conform to current
subdivision and zoning regulations, an extension of the approval of a
preliminary plat may be granted for a period of up to 12 months. The Planning
and Zoning Coordinator may defer the extension request to City Council within
ten days of receipt of the request.

      (2)    City Council. Within 30 days of the Commission recommendation of
the replat, the City Council shall approve, approve with conditions, or

passed 8-27-19)
§ 154.028 ROUGH PROPORTIONALITY.
   (A)   Proportionality determination.
      (1)   Before a decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission on an
application or for approval of a plat or plan for development, or prior to a
decision on any other application on which an exaction requirement is placed as
a condition of approval, the City Engineer shall affirm that the requirements
of this chapter, or other ordinance requiring the permit, as applied to the
proposed subdivision or development, do not impose costs on the applicant for
public infrastructure improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to
the impact of the proposed subdivision or development. In making this
determination, the City Engineer may consider any information relating to the
impacts created by the proposed subdivision or development on the city's public
facilities systems, including:
         (a)   The proposed and potential use of the land;
         (b)   The timing and sequence of development in relation to
availability of adequate levels of public facilities systems;
         (c)   Impact fee studies; traffic impact studies; drainage studies; or
any other studies or standards that measure the demand for services created by
developments and the impact on the city's public facilities systems;
         (d)   The level of service and functionality of both on-site and off-
site public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed subdivision or
development;
         (e)   The degree to which acceptable private infrastructure
improvements to be constructed and maintained by the applicant will offset the
need for public infrastructure improvements; and
         (f)   Any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure
improvements for which the proposed subdivision is eligible.
      (2)   The City Engineer may require an applicant and the applicant's
engineer, at their expense, submit reasonable information or studies that may
assist in making the proportionality determination.
   (B)   Appeal to City Council.
      (1)   A subdivider or other applicant for approval of a plat or plan for
development, or other permit which imposes an exaction requirement as a
condition of approval may appeal the City Engineer's determination under
division (A) to the City Council under Tex. Local Gov’t Code § 212.904. To
pursue an appeal, the subdivider or applicant must file a written notice of
appeal with the City Secretary within ten days of the date the Planning and
Zoning Commission or the city official responsible for issuing the permit takes
an action applying the exaction requirement, which may include denial of the
permit or plat. The notice of appeal shall:
         (a)   Specifically state each exaction requirement for which relief is
sought;
         (b)   For each requirement, state the reasons application of the
requirement is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impact
created by the proposed subdivision or development; and
         (c)   Where appropriate, propose an alternative requirement the
subdivider or applicant contends is roughly proportional to the nature and
extent of the impact created by the proposed subdivision or development.
      (2)   The City Secretary shall forward the appeal to the City Council for
consideration.
   (C)   Appeal to court. An applicant may appeal the decision of the City
Council to the county or district court of the county in which the development
is located, within 30 days of the date that the City Council issues its final
decision.

for plat amendment;
            2.   Neither lot is abolished and the number of lots does not
change;
            3.   No recorded covenant or restriction is removed; and
            4.   The amendment does not have materially adverse effects on the

of a building or other improvement on a lot line or easement;
         (i)   To relocate one or more lot lines between one or more adjacent

restrictions; and
            3.   The area covered by the changes is located in an area that the
municipal planning commission or other appropriate governing body of the
municipality has approved, after a public hearing, as a residential improvement
area; or
         (k)   To replat one or more lots fronting on an existing street if:

amending the plat;
            2.   The amendment does not attempt to remove recorded covenants or
restrictions;
            3.   The amendment does not increase the number of lots; and
            4.   The amendment does not create or require the creation of a new

      (3)   Notice, a hearing, and the approval of other lot owners are not
required for the approval and issuance of an amending plat.
   (B)   Application submittal. Copies of the amending plat application shall

(Ord. 08-2019-47, passed 8-27-19)
§ 154.030 CONVEYANCE PLATS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   A conveyance plat is used solely for the purpose of subdividing
property and creating a recording instrument of that subdivision, or recording
the creation of a single existing lot or parcel created by other means.
      (2)   A conveyance plat may be used to convey or sell property or
interests therein.
      (3)   A conveyance plat is not considered to be the initial step in
development of a project and is not intended to provide, or be predictive of,
details, regulations, or standards regarding future development of, or projects
on, the property.
      (4)   A conveyance plat may not be used to establish vested rights on the
property or to vest the property with rights to the code, or other applicable
ordinances or regulations, in place at the time the conveyance plat is
approved. Future plat and permit approvals shall be based upon the code and
other applicable ordinances and regulations in place at the time such
application(s) are submitted.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   A conveyance plat may be used only to record the subdivision of
property in the city, or the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city,
provided that all lots created by the conveyance plat meet the requirements of
this section.
      (2)   A conveyance plat shall not be approved for any property zoned "SF"
or a PD (planned development district) whose base zoning is "SF", unless all
lots shown on the conveyance plat are shown to have provided the following:
         (a)   Direct access to an existing public street; and
         (b)   Are adequately served by, or have direct access at the property
line to, public utilities, or meet the minimum required size to be served by
private water or sewer systems.
   (C)   Not to be used for purpose of approving development. A conveyance plat
does not constitute any approval of development on the property and does not
take the place of other required plats, including, but not limited to,
preliminary plats and final plats.
   (D)   Application submittal and requirements.
      (1)   The conveyance plat application shall be submitted in accordance
with all provisions of this section.
      (2)   The plat drawing shall provide the information listed in §
154.025, “Required Plat Information,” where applicable.
      (3)   A conveyance plat is only for the subdivision of property and shall
include a notation on the face of the plat that states: "This Conveyance Plat
is approved solely for the purpose of defining lots and other interests in the
property described herein. No development of the property has been approved and
no approval of future development or acceptance of public improvements is
expressed or implied with the approval of this Conveyance Plat. No permanent
utility service, construction permits, including building permits, or
Certificates of Occupancy shall be issued until a Final Plat is approved, filed
of record, and public improvements are accepted by the City in accordance with
its ordinances and regulations. The City may, in accordance with adopted
ordinances, regulations, and master plans in effect at the time of future plat
approval, require additional rights-of-way, easements, or other property to be
dedicated upon a Final Plat for all or a portion of the property subject to
this Conveyance Plat."
   (E)   Reservation or dedication of public right-of-way.
      (1)   All lots created by a conveyance plat shall have frontage upon, or
access to, an existing, or proposed, public street that is specified on the
city's Master Thoroughfare Plan. Development, including building construction,
shall not occur on the property until adequate street connections are completed
to each lot per approved civil plans, notwithstanding any utility or other
improvements that are required before obtaining such development approval.
      (2)   Reservation of future rights-of-way is required to be shown on the
conveyance plat for any existing or planned roadways in accordance with this
chapter. Right-of-way reservation acknowledges the future obligation to
dedicate right-of-way for public thoroughfares and streets specified on the
city's Master Thoroughfare Plan. Reservation of right-of-way does not grant any
right or interest in the property to the city or other entity. The final width
and configuration of streets and right-of-way to be dedicated may be adjusted
upon approval of a final plat in accordance with approved civil plans.
      (3)   Dedication, rather than reservation, of right-of-way shall be
required where a conveyance plat is used to record the remainder of a tract
left over following the approval of the final plat on a portion of the
property. The required right-of-way dedication under this chapter shall be
limited to that which is necessary to provide access to the property subject to
the final plat, and to allow for construction of turn lanes, intersections, and
transitions in road pavement width resulting from development of the property
subject to the final plat. Additional right-of-way may be required with
approval of a final plat for all or a portion of the remainder of the property
subject to the conveyance plat.
   (F)   Effect of approval.
      (1)   No building permits shall be issued, nor shall development commence
upon property for which a conveyance plat has been approved until all other
applicable requirements of this chapter, and other applicable chapters of the
code, or other applicable ordinances and regulations, have been met, including,
but not limited to, approval of required civil plans and preliminary and final
plats.
      (2)   Conveyance plat approval does not relieve the property owner, or
future owners, from obligations, including, but not limited to, rough
proportionality costs, impact fees, or dedication of property for public
purpose, that are required by other sections of this chapter, other applicable
chapters of the code, other applicable ordinances and regulations, or by the
city's adopted master plans, regarding the improvement of the property or
extension of services as required to make the property suitable for
development.
      (3)   Neither reservation nor dedication of right-of-way shall relieve
the property owner from any obligation for street construction or assessments
required under this chapter or any other chapter of the code or other
applicable ordinances and regulations.
      (4)   If a preliminary plat is approved for all, or a portion, of the
property shown on a recorded conveyance plat, the preliminary plat is
controlling on that portion of the property. For the purposes of determining
the compliance of a future final plat, the preliminary plat will supersede the
conveyance plat, but the conveyance plat is not vacated or replated on that
portion of the property unless and until a final plat is approved and filed of
record.
      (5)   The filing of a final plat upon all or a portion of the property
shown on a conveyance plat permanently supersedes the conveyance plat on the
portion of the property within the boundaries of the final plat.
      (6)   Easements for access, utilities, and drainage may be recorded on
conveyance plats and may be vacated by a final plat approved for the same
property, subject to the requirements for easement vacation in this chapter.
   (G)   Approval procedure.
      (1)   Upon completion of the submission procedure by the owner, a
conveyance plat shall be reviewed and approved administratively if it meets the
requirements of this section and otherwise qualifies as a minor plat under §
154.027(A)(1) through (3), as amended.
      (2)   Conveyance plats that meet the requirements of this section but do
not qualify as a minor plat under §
154.027 shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its
recommendation and to City Council for approval, approval with conditions, or

MINIMUM PLATTING DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 154.040 CONFORMITY REQUIRED.
   The physical design of the proposed subdivision shall conform to the
planning policies of the city and the following minimum standards set forth in
this subchapter.
('68 Code, App. B, Art. III, preamble) (Ord. 8-1989-34, passed 8-8-89)
§ 154.041 STREET STANDARDS.
   (A)   Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, provisions shall be made
for the extension of major streets in accordance with the thoroughfare plan of
the city. Collector streets shall be provided for the circulation of traffic in
and out of the subdivision and the connection thereof to the major streets.
Adequate local streets shall be provided to accommodate the subdivision.
   (B)   Where such is not shown in the thoroughfare plan, the arrangement of
streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation of appropriate projection of existing
major streets in surrounding areas;
      (2)   Conform to a plan for a neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Commission to meet a particular situation where topography or other conditions
make continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical; or
      (3)   Conform to a plan for street location or extension approved by the
City Council after review by the Commission.
   (C)   Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic
in residential areas will be discouraged.
   (D)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the Commission may require that no driveways for residential purposes
be allowed or other such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection
of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
   (E)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
freeway, the Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on
each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use
of the intervening land. The distance of a street from a railroad or freeway
shall recognize the problem of approach grades and future grade separations.
   (F)   Street intersections.
      (1)   More than two streets intersecting at a point shall be avoided,
except where it is impractical to secure a proper street system otherwise and
approval of such special intersections shall be based upon detail review of the
design of the intersection including the need for any traffic signalization
which may be required for safety.
      (2)   Where several streets converge at one point, or acute intersection
angles are present, setback lines, special rounding or cutoff corners may be
required to insure safety and facilitation of orderly traffic movements.
      (3)   No major thoroughfare shall intersect any other major street at an
angle of less than 80 degrees.
      (4)   No collector street shall intersect a major street in an angle of
less than 70 degrees, or another collector street at an angle of less than 70
degrees.
      (5)   No local street shall intersect any major street at an angle of
less than 80 degrees, or any collector street at an angle of less than 65
degrees.
   (G)   Cul-de-sacs, dead ends or courts. Cul-de-sacs, courts or places may be
permitted where the form or contour of the land or the shape of the property
makes such street design appropriate. Such cul-de-sacs, courts, or places shall
provide proper access to all lots and shall generally not exceed 500 feet in
length and a turn-around shall be provided at the closed end which has a
minimum right-of-way radius of 60 feet except that if an equally safe and
convenient form of paved space is approved by the Commission in place of a
turning circle. Such approved space may be improved as agreed upon.
   (H)   Streets with centerline offset of less than 180 feet shall not be
approved except in special cases recommended by the City Engineer and approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Collector streets shall not have a
centerline offset of less than 300 feet when they are not continuous.
   (I)   Street right-of-way width shall be in conformance with the City's
Master Thoroughfare Plan and shall not be less than as follows:
 
Street Type                                           Right-of-Way
Freeway or expressway                                 As required

Collector (includes industrial or commercial street)  75 ft.
Local, residential                                    50 ft.
Legacy road (existing roads only, that meet criteria) 28-49 ft.
 
   (J)   The maximum street right-of-way the subdivider shall be required to
dedicate in the subdivision of land shall be 135 feet in width.
   (K)   Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision land where the Planning and Zoning
Commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other
half of a street when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half
street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half to the street
shall be platted within such tract. Half major or collector streets and one-
half of the street shall be required from each property.
   (L)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to approval of the
City Council.
   (M)   Street numbers are to be assigned by the city.
   (N)   All rights-of-way shall be platted to permit street designs to conform
with §§
154.080 et seq.

   (E)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street line unless other arrangements are approved by the Commission.
   (F)   Where the area is divided into larger lots than for normal urban
building sites and, in the opinion of the Commission, any or all of the tracts
are susceptible of being resubdivided, the original subdivision shall be such
that the alignment of future street dedications may conform to the general
street layout in the surrounding area and so that the larger tracts may be
later subdivided in conformance with the requirements of this chapter and the
minimum standards specified by
Chapter 155, Zoning.
('68 Code, App. B, § 3.04) (Ord. 8-1989-34, passed 8-8-89)
§ 154.045 EASEMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Utility easements shall be provided within the proposed subdivision as
may be necessary to assure the proper design, installation and maintenance of
either underground or aerial utilities. Easement widths shall be determined by
the type of utility; however, an easement shall not normally be required
adjacent to a dedicated right-of-way.
   (B)   The minimum width for easements shall be:
      (1)   Utility easements (along property lines) shall be eight feet on
each side of the property line;
      (2)   Drainage easements shall be the width of the drainage structure
plus five feet on each side, rounding the total distance down to the nearest
foot, or the width of the 50-year floodplain, whichever is greater.
   (C)   When the City Engineer finds that easements in areas adjoining
proposed subdivisions are necessary to provide adequate passage of stormwater
or to serve such subdivisions with utilities, the subdivider shall have the
primary responsibility for obtaining such easements.
   (D)   When a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream or a proposed stormwater easement, the developer
shall make the improvements required in §§
154.120 et seq. and dedicate the required right-of-way or easements.
   (E)   Wherever land which is covered by a floodway designation under
Chapter 151, Floodplain Management, a stormwater easement shall be placed on
the plat covering the floodway area and such easement shall allow for access,
maintenance or alteration of the floodway area by the city. A statement shall
be placed on the plat as follows: “Structures, including fences and fill
material are prohibited in the floodway.”
   (F)   Mutual access easements:
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this requirement is to provide public
access to adjacent properties by reducing the number of driveway cuts and
potential traffic accidents on adjacent streets.
      (2)   Applicability. This section shall be applicable to properties
abutting and that may derive access from a collector street or arterial street
as shown on the Master Thoroughfare Plan.
      (3)   Requirement. The city shall require the dedication of a mutual
access easement to provide cross access to adjacent properties or shared use of
a driveway to facilitate traffic flow between lots.
      (4)   Easement dimensions. Easement width shall be 24 feet and the length
shall be the full width of adjoining properties fronting the roadway. The
Director of Public Works may approve an alternative layout as necessary given
the shape of the particular tract. The location of all mutual access easements
shall be approved by the city.
('68 Code, App. B, § 3.05) (Ord. 8-1989-34, passed 8-8-89; Am. Ord. 12-2017-76,

§ 154.046 SPECIAL COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISION STANDARDS.
   An industrial subdivision shall be processed for approval in the same manner
as provided for a residential subdivision, except that no individual lots need
be shown on such plat and only streets, blocks, easements, and minimum building
lines need be indicated. The minimum right-of-way width of a minor street in an
industrial or commercial subdivision shall be 60 feet or as required by the
Commission and all other streets shall conform to the standards for major and
secondary streets prescribed by the major thoroughfare plan.
('68 Code, App. B, § 3.06) (Ord. 8-1989-34, passed 8-8-89)
§ 154.047 PARK FACILITIES.
   Park and open space design features and dedication requirements.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The requirements for open space, park and
recreational areas contained in this section are intended to ensure that there
will be sufficient land dedicated or otherwise set aside to meet the demand and
need of the future residents for open space and parks. In determining the size,
shape, and quality of open space and parks areas that should be set aside and
reserved in the manner set out in this section, the city has considered the
projected growth in population and development within the municipality and the
amount of open space and park and recreational facilities needed to accommodate
such growth as stated in the Parks, Recreation, Trails & Open Space Master
Plan.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Unplatted property. This section, as amended, applies to all
residential property for which a final plat has not been formally submitted to
the city for approval, unless otherwise noted herein.
      (2)   Exempt property. Any tract or lot occupied by an existing
residential dwelling unit at the time of adoption of this section shall be
exempt from the dedication requirements of this section herein if the
residential dwelling remains on the lot. This exemption pertains only to the
tract or lot with the existing residential dwelling. Any additional lots
created by further subdivision of the property shall be subject to the
requirements herein.
      (3)   Date of assessment. All requirements in this section shall be
assessed at the time of approval of the final plat of any applicable property.
   (C)   Land dedication requirements; general. Land dedication shall be
incorporated as a part of each residential development where applicable. Land
dedication requirements herein are based on the city’s adopted Land Use Plan
and the Parks Recreation, Trails & Open Space Master Plan. It is within the
sole discretion of the city to require a developer to show the anticipated land
dedication requirements herein with the development plan, concept plan,
preliminary plat, final plat, or other appropriate development submittals.
      (1)   Residential developments. Based on the population projected to
reside in the city and the stated desire in the Parks, Recreation, Trails &
Open Space Master Plan adopted by the City Council to provide 17.3 acres of
park land for every 1,000 residents in an ultimate condition, park land meeting
the requirements contained within this section shall be dedicated to the city
at a ratio of one acre of park land for every 60 residential dwelling units or
prorated portion thereof.
      (2)   Off-site dedications. With the consent of the City Council, a
developer may dedicate the required park land for development at another
location within the city, provided that the off-site land dedication is in
accordance with this section.
   (D)   Characteristics of parkland; general. The city shall consider the
characteristics of proposed dedicated park land as outlined in the Parks,
Recreation, Trails & Open Space Master Plan and as recommended by the Park
Board. In determining whether to accept or refuse the dedication of park lands,
fees, facilities or a combination thereof as outlined below, the Park Board,
Planning and Zoning Commission, and City Council shall consider the Parks,
Recreation, Trails & Open Space Master Plan recommendations and use it as a
guideline for such decisions.
   (E)   Alternatives to land dedication. In any case where a dedication is
required, the City Council shall have the right to accept the dedication as
submitted for approval, or in the alternative, to refuse dedication of the
same, and in lieu thereof to require payment of cash under the formula
contained in this section or to allow the developer to construct recreation or
park improvements. The city may permit a combination of dedication,
improvements and fees to be used to fulfill this requirement.
      (1)   Fee payment.
         (a)   Approval of fee payment. The City Council shall determine the
acceptability of a developer’s payment of fees in lieu of the land dedication
requirement of this section.
         (b)   Calculation of fees.
            1.   The City Council shall establish an acreage land value cost
figure to be used in calculating park fees. This determination shall be based
on a reasonable study and investigation performed biennially, or as directed by
City Council as to the average fair market value, as opposed to tax value, of
undeveloped acreage suitable for residential use within the city. This figure
shall be the acreage cost under which all park fees are calculated.
            2.   Residential dwelling unit fees. Fees paid in lieu of
dedication shall be based on the determined cost of one acre of land divided by
60, for a resulting fee per residential dwelling unit.
         (c)   Collection of fees. Fees shall be collected prior to plat being
filed with the county. No building permit shall be issued nor shall any
construction be allowed to begin until payment of any fees required by this
section have been made, as specified in a developer’s agreement approved by the
city, or other city documentation.
      (2)   Physical or equipment improvements to parks; Compatibility with
Parks, Recreation, Trails & Open Space Master Plan. A developer may, if
approved by the City Council, have the option of improving existing facilities
within municipal parks or improving dedicated park land in lieu of park land
dedication or payment of cash, based on recommendations made in the Parks,
Recreation, Trails & Open Space Master Plan. Should any of these options be
exercised, the municipality and the developer shall, prior to initiation of
work on such improvements, enter into a developer’s agreement for credit of
expenses for authorized park improvements. In no case shall the municipality be
required to reimburse the developer if he or she chooses to improve parklands
at an amount greater than required. Such a proposed agreement to provide
facility improvements in lieu of dedication shall be submitted in writing with
the application for any required concept plan or site plan. In the event that
no concept plan or site plan is required, the agreement shall be submitted with
the application for the preliminary plat. Any improvements for which credit is
requested must be submitted for approval by the City Council in a developer’s
agreement.
   (F)   Private open space/parks. If a developer desires to incorporate
private park, recreation or open space areas or amenities within his or her
development, they may request credit for these facilities against their public
open space dedication requirements. A developer may request credit for any
private park, recreation or open space area, and such private park, recreation
or open space amenities may satisfy 100% of the total park and open space
dedication requirement of this section. Private park, recreation and open space
areas or amenities must be owned and maintained by an entity other than the
city.
   (G)   Approval process.
      (1)   Land dedications.
         (a)   Park Board recommendation. The Director of Parks and Recreation
or the Director’s designated representative shall report to the Park Board
regarding any park land dedication from a development application submitted to
the city which would result in a land dedication of five acres or greater, or
which is proposed by a developer, or for which a dedication is proposed by
staff. The Park Board may then make a formal recommendation to the Planning and
Zoning Commission to accept or refuse any proposed dedicated park land prior to
the Commission’s action on the development. In the event that the Parks and
Recreation Board is unable to meet due to a lack of quorum prior to the
Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, a formal recommendation from the
Director of Parks and Recreation shall be provided instead to the Commission.
         (b)   Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall consider the recommendation of the Park Board in
determining the acceptability of any park land dedications proposed on any
development. The Commission recommendation shall then be forwarded to the City
Council, where applicable, for final approval.
         (c)   Final plat dedications. Where review of development applications
results in the city’s desire for land dedication, such land dedication shall be
shown on a final plat and shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of that
land to the city.
      (2)   Fee payments in lieu of dedication and/or facilities improvements.
         (a)   City Council approval.
            1.   The City Council shall enter into an agreement with the
developer for the provision of dedicated park land, fees in lieu of dedication,
facilities construction or improvement, or a combination thereof as outlined
below.
            2.   Developer’s agreements. Developer’s agreements between the
city and the developer shall include the following requirements as applicable:
               A.   Boundary corners established. Each corner of the park land
to be dedicated shall be permanently monumented with three-quarter-inch iron
pins set in concrete. These shall be located and identified on a recordable
plat or land survey completed by a land surveyor registered in the State of
Texas and provided to the city by the owner and/or developer.
               B.   Utility extensions to park. All park land dedicated to the
city shall have access to public utilities, including water and sewer. If
requested by the city, water and sewer mains shall be extended by the owner
and/or developer within the proposed park land to a location specified by the
Director of Public Works.
               C.   Short-term maintenance. The owner and/or developer agree
that no construction materials shall be disposed of or deposited within the
park by its contractor, subcontractors, employees or agents at any time while
the subdivision is being built. If materials are deposited or disposed of
within the park, the owner and/or developer shall be required to remove these
materials within 72 hours of written notice by the city. Before the city
accepts this land, the developer shall remove all trash and dead trees.
   (H)   Use of funds.
      (1)   Fund established. Funds received by the city pursuant to this
section will be deposited in a special fund dedicated to the accumulation of
monies required by this section.
      (2)   Permitted expenditures. Monies placed in this fund may be expended
only for the purchase, lease, or other acquisition of park and open space areas
by the city, the improvement and site preparation of such areas and sites, the
extension of utilities to or within such sites, the installation of
landscaping, play equipment or recreation improvements on such sites, and/or
attendant engineering and planning costs associated with such park development.
      (3)   Inappropriate expenditures. Monies placed in this fund may not be
utilized for any other general business activity of the city or for maintenance
of park facilities.
      (4)   Authorization for use of funds. All expenditures from this fund
shall be made in accordance with the city’s Parks, Recreation, Trails & Open
Space Master Plan and shall be approved by the City Council after a formal
recommendation of the Park Board.

construction of pedestrian walkways within the city in order to promote the
health, safety and general welfare of the community.
   (B)   Sidewalk requirements. New development requires pedestrian elements on
the on both sides of a new roadway. Development adjacent to existing roadway
requires sidewalks if:
      (1)   Fronting a roadway designated on the master thoroughfare plan as a
non-local street; or
      (2)   Fronting a roadway where sidewalks exist on 50% or more of the
properties on the block face.
   (C)   Design standards.
      (1)   All sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet in width, except a
sidewalk located within or abutting a collector street, or larger, as shown on
the master thoroughfare plan, which shall not be less than five feet in width.
      (2)   All sidewalks and pathways shall be constructed in the area between
the curb or grade line of the public street and the abutting property line,
unless the pathway is situated within a dedicated pathway easement or right-of-
way. The edge of the sidewalk or pathway shall generally be parallel with the
curb line, and situated no more than one foot from the abutting property line.
The Director of Public Works may approve a plan to alter the location and size
of a sidewalk to preserve a tree or for aesthetic purposes. One additional foot
of width shall be added to a sidewalk that abuts a street curb.

constructed so as to provide a ramp that complies with the Architectural
Barriers Act and TDLR. Barrier-free ramps shall be provided for access to the
street.
   (E)   Waivers. A complete waiver of the requirement for the construction of
sidewalks for a specific development should be rare and allowed only where
there are unusual factors.
      (1)   Unusual factors include:
         (a)   Projects where the cost of establishing sidewalks or walkways
would be unreasonably disproportionate to the cost of the associated roadway
construction or overall project costs;
         (b)   Areas with severe topography or other natural constraints that
will constrain proper implementation of the required sidewalk;
         (c)   Situations inherently adverse to pedestrian activity, such as
harmful noise, dust creation, and high volume truck traffic, in certain areas,
such as agricultural, heavy commercial, and industrial developments; or
         (d)   Situations where an applicant can show other factors or
circumstances amounting to reasonably justifiable good cause to support such
waiver.
      (2)   The Public Works Director or designee shall make a determination as
to whether or not the waiver should be granted, and document that determination
with supporting data that states the basis for the decision.
   (F)   Appeal process. A denial of a request for a waiver of these
requirements may be appealed to the City Council.
      (1)   A written appeal must be filed with the Director of Public Works
within ten days of the denial.
      (2)   The appeal must provide justification for the requested waiver,
based on the established criteria stated above.

traffic study and a traffic impact analysis (TIA); and
         (d)   Establish equitable mitigation measures for the accommodation of
identified impacts.
      (2)   Applicability of requirements.
         (a)   A traffic study is required for zoning requests when:
            1.   The proposed zoning request will generate over 50 trips during
the peak hour; or
            2.   The proposed zoning request will generate over 500 trips per
day for residential traffic; or
            3.   The proposed zoning request will generate over 1,000 trips per
day for commercial traffic.
         (b)   A traffic impact analysis (TIA) is required for all plats when:
            1.   The proposed subdivision consists of 100 or more dwelling
units.
            2.   The proposed subdivision generates over 100 trips during peak
hours.
            3.   The proposed subdivision generates over 1,000 trips per day.
         (c)   Special circumstances. A traffic study and traffic impact
analysis (TIA) may also be required for zoning and development applications if
one or more of the following conditions exist:
            1.   City Council determines that additional information beyond the
required submittals is needed to determine the impacts of the proposed
development on the transportation system.
            2.   Traffic generated from a non-residential development will
significantly impact adjacent residential neighborhoods.
            3.   Traffic operational impacts such as conflicts with driveways,
left or right turns, signal timing, median openings or sight distance are
anticipated. In such cases the study will only be required to answer questions
related to the specific impacts.
            4.   Existing traffic conflicts on adjacent streets are expected to
worsen due to traffic generated from the new development.
            5.   Implementation of the Master Thoroughfare Plan in the area
will not occur prior to development of the property.
            6.   The proposed land use differs significantly from that
contemplated in the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
            7.   The internal street or access system is not anticipated to
accommodate the expected traffic generation.
      (3)   Study submission requirements.
         (a)   Timing of submittals. If required, a study shall be submitted to
the city in accordance with the following:
            1.   Zoning cases. The traffic study shall be submitted no later
than the submission of the zoning case application.
            2.   Subdivision plats. The traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be
submitted no later than the submission of the first plat application.

cause a facility or traffic movement to fall below a LOS C, or the traffic
facility or movement is already is below a LOS C and the development would
contribute 5% or more of the total traffic during built conditions, or the
traffic impact analysis (TIA) recommends mitigation measures. If mitigation is
required, the applicant must mitigate the impact of the proposed development,
and would not be responsible for alleviating any deficiencies in the
thoroughfare system that may occur without the proposed development. Acceptable
mitigation measures include but are not limited to:
         (a)   Staging of development in order to relate site development to
the construction of the required thoroughfare system;
         (b)   Off-site improvements, including the provision of right-of-way
and/or the participation in funding for needed thoroughfare and intersection
improvement projects; and
         (c)   On-site improvements, including access controls and site
circulation adjustments.
   (E)   Effect of adequacy determination. If this section requires the
submission of a traffic study and the adequacy determination for roadways
indicates that the off-site roadway network serving the proposed subdivision is
inadequate, the subdivider shall execute a community facilities agreement with
the city to ensure the roadways are adequate to accommodate the impacts of the
subdivision. The agreement may include a joint participation agreement under §
154.063 or an escrow of funds for future construction under §
154.065.
   (F)   Phasing. If the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a
larger subdivision or constitutes a portion of the property to be ultimately
developed, the city may require a demonstration of adequacy for additional
phases as a condition of approval of the proposed plat.

§ 154.090 PRIVATE STREETS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish regulations for
subdivisions with privately owned streets.
   (B)   Authority. The regulations contained in this section have been adopted
under the following authority:
      (1)   Chapter 212 - Municipal Regulation of Subdivisions and Property
Development of the Texas Loc. Gov’t Code, which authorizes a municipality to
adopt rules governing plats and subdivisions of land within the municipality's
jurisdiction.
      (2)   Chapter 51 - General Powers of Municipalities of the Texas Loc.
Gov’t Code, which authorizes a municipality to adopt ordinances, rules, or
police regulations that are for the good government, peace, or the trade and
commerce of the municipality.
      (3)   The Home Rule Charter of the City of Cleburne, Texas, which
authorizes the City Council to exercise all powers granted to municipalities by
the Constitution or the laws of the State of Texas.
   (C)   Applicability. The regulations contained in this section shall be
applicable to any proposed subdivision plat, to any petition to convert a
public street to a private street, and to any petition to convert a private
street to a public street submitted to the city after May 1, 2024.
   (D)   Requirements for subdivisions.
      (1)   Planning considerations. The following criteria shall be used as
guidelines in the review and approval of a private street subdivision.
         (a)   Streets shown on the adopted Thoroughfare Plan of the city must
not be used, maintained, or constructed as private streets.
         (b)   A subdivision with private streets and alleys must not impede or
cross an existing or proposed street as shown on the city's most recent
Thoroughfare Plan or approved preliminary or final plats.
         (c)   A subdivision with private streets must not disrupt or
disconnect an existing or proposed city public pedestrian pathway, hike and
bike trail, or park as shown on the city's most recent Park Plan.
         (d)   The perimeter of a subdivision with private streets must include
a minimum of 80 feet of contiguous frontage upon a public street.
         (e)   The proposed subdivision with private streets must be zoned for
residential purposes and contain 25 single-family lots or greater.
         (f)   The proposed subdivision must not negatively affect traffic
circulation on public streets outside of the subdivision.
         (g)   The proposed subdivision must not negatively impair access to
on-site or off-site properties or future developments.
         (h)   The proposed subdivision must not negatively impair access to or
from public facilities, such as schools, parks and libraries, etc.
         (i)   The proposed subdivision must not negatively impact the response
time of emergency vehicles.
      (2)   Construction of private streets and drainage infrastructure.
         (a)   Private street lot. Private streets must be constructed within a
separate lot owned by the HOA. This lot must conform to the city's standards
for public street right-of-way. An easement covering the street lot must be
granted to the city providing the right to enter for purposes of maintaining
the public infrastructure and utilities and an access easement for exercising
governmental services, including but not limited to fire and police protection,
inspection and code enforcement. The right to use the street lot for utilities
shall extend to all utility providers, including telecommunication companies
operating within the city. The easement shall permit the city to remove any
vehicle or obstacle within the private street lot that impairs emergency
access.
         (b)   Street, sidewalk and drainage design and construction standards.
Private streets, drainage systems, and sidewalks must conform to the same
design and construction standards for the design and construction of public
streets, drainage systems, and sidewalks.
         (c)   Traffic signs. All traffic regulatory signs along private
streets must conform to the Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and
be maintained by the Homeowner's Association ("HOA").
         (d)   Plans and inspections. Proposed subdivision with private streets
must submit to the city the same plans and engineering information required to
construct public streets, utilities and related appurtenances. Requirements
pertaining to inspection and approval of improvements prior to the city's
acceptance of the subdivision shall apply. Fees charged for these services
shall also apply. The city shall have the right to inspect the private streets
and related appurtenances at any time, and require the HOA to provide the
repairs needed to ensure emergency access. The City Council shall be the final
judge of whether such repairs are needed.
         (e)   No cost to city. The city shall not pay for any portion of the
cost of constructing the street and drainage infrastructure in the subdivision.
      (3)   Maintenance of private streets and drainage infrastructure.
         (a)   The HOA for the subdivision shall be responsible for the
maintenance of all streets and drainage infrastructure in the subdivision. The
city shall not pay for any portion of the cost of maintaining the streets and
drainage improvements in the subdivision.
         (b)   The city shall have authority to inspect all streets, drainage
facilities, and related appurtenances in the subdivision on a periodic basis to
determine the need for repairs to the infrastructure. If the city finds the
streets or drainage infrastructure in need of repairs, the HOA shall repair all
drainage and street facilities upon receipt of a notice of deficiency from the
city. If the HOA disagrees with the city's determination, the HOA may appeal
the determination as provided in division (E) of this section. If the HOA fails
to timely make repairs to the street and drainage infrastructure, the city may,
in its sole discretion, complete the needed repairs and assess the properties
in the subdivision for the costs.
      (4)   Public infrastructure. Water and sanitary sewer infrastructure
shall be constructed in accordance with city standards and dedicated to the
city. All water and sanitary sewer infrastructure shall be installed within a
public easement granted over the private street lot.
      (5)   Access standards.
         (a)   Restricted access allowed. The HOA may construct and maintain
guard houses, access control gates, and cross arms constructed in accordance
with the requirements of this section. All restricted access entrances must be
manned 24 hours every day, unless an alternative means of access to the
subdivision is provided for the city and other utility service providers. If
the HOA fails to provide an adequate method of access for the city or other
utility service providers, the city shall have the right to remove any gate or
other device that is a barrier to access to the subdivision, and the city may
assess the properties in the subdivision for the costs.
         (b)   Restricted access entrance design standards. Any private street
which has an access control gate or cross arm must have a minimum uninterrupted
pavement width of 24 feet at the location of the access control device. If an
overhead barrier is used, it must have a minimum height above the road surface
as required by the Fire Code for fire lanes. The design of all gates, cross
arms and access control devices, including automatic opening systems and manual
backup systems must be approved by the city prior to installation. The gates,
cross arms and opening devices must be tested and accepted by the city prior to
being put into operation. Gate designs may incorporate one or two gate sections
to meet the required minimum width of 24 feet. If the entrance is to
incorporate a median, guard shack, or similar structure that necessitates a
divided gate arrangement, the gate and street pavement widths may be reduced if
approved by the city, but in no case shall any single gate or street pavement
have a clear opening of less than 18 feet in width. All restricted access
entrances shall be equipped with the Knox Rapid Access System opening system.
The system shall be maintained by the HOA in good working condition at all
times. Any restricted access entrance that has an access control gate or cross
arm that requires residents to stop before gaining access must be set back a
minimum of 50 feet from the boundary of the subdivision to provide for
automobile queuing, unless a traffic study shows that a larger setback is
required to provide sufficient vehicle queuing. Restricted access entrances
equipped with an electronic opener that allows residents to remotely open the
control access gate or cross arm and enter the subdivision without having to
stop are exempted from this requirement. A sign must be erected at any
restricted access entrance that does not meet the requirements for a visitor
entrance to indicate that it is for resident use only and not for visitors.
         (c)   Visitor entrance design standards. At least one entrance per
subdivision with private streets must be equipped for visitor access. An
entrance for visitor access must comply with all of the standards for a
restricted access entrance in division (D)(5)(b) above. An entrance for visitor
access must be equipped with a call or code box to allow visitors to call-in
for access. The call or code box must be located at least 50 feet from the
boundary of the subdivision to allow sufficient room for automobile queuing.
The city reserves the right to require the developer or the HOA installing the
visitor entrance to provide a detailed study to determine if the traffic
generated by the proposed development will warrant a larger setback to ensure
sufficient vehicle queuing space. A turn-around space with a minimum outside
radius of 30 feet must be located between any call or code box and access
control gate or cross arm to allow vehicles denied access to safely exit onto
public streets in a "head out" position. A sign must be erected next to the
edge of such turn around space to prohibit vehicle parking in such space.
      (6)   Homeowners associations required. A subdivision developed with
private street and drainage infrastructure must have a mandatory HOA which
includes all properties served by the private streets. The HOA shall own and be
responsible for the maintenance of the private street and drainage
infrastructure. The HOA's creation documents must:
         (a)   Provide that the streets and drainage systems within the
development are private, owned and maintained by the HOA, and that the city has
no obligation to maintain the private streets and drainage systems;
         (b)   Be filed of record prior to the approval of the final plat;
         (c)   Provide that lot deeds must convey membership in the HOA and
provide for the payment of dues and assessments required by the HOA;
         (d)   Provide that the city has authority to inspect all streets,
drainage facilities, and related appurtenances in the subdivision on a periodic
basis to determine the need for repairs, that the HOA must repair all
infrastructure that the city determines to be in need of repair, that if the
HOA fails to timely make the repairs the city may perform the necessary repairs
and assess the properties in the subdivision for the costs;
         (e)   Provide that if the HOA fails to provide and maintain an
adequate method of access for the city and other utility services providers,
the city shall have the right to remove any gate or other device that is a
barrier to access to the subdivision and may assess the properties in the
subdivision for the costs;
         (f)   Provide that the HOA must not be dissolved without the prior
written consent of the city;
         (g)   Provide that no portion of the HOA's documents pertaining to the
maintenance of the private streets and assessments thereto shall be amended
without the written consent of the city;
         (h)   Provide that the HOA, as owner of the private streets and
appurtenances, agrees to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city,
its officers, agents, licensees, servants and employees, from and against any
and all claims or suits for property damage or loss and/or personal injury,
including death, to any and all persons, of whatsoever kind of character,
whether real or asserted, arising out of or in connection with, directly or
indirectly: 1) the reasonable use of the private streets, emergency access,
utility easements, entrance gate or structure by the city, its officers,
agents, licensees, servants and employees; 2) the condition of the private
streets, private street lights, private entrance gates or structures, private
walls or fences, private pedestrian access, private storm drainage systems and
emergency access; or 3) any use of the subdivision with private streets by the

('68 Code, App. B, § 7.03) (Ord. 8-1989-34, passed 8-8-89)
§ 154.123 DRAINAGE FEATURES AND POLICIES.
   (A)   Types. The four different types of basic drainage features are as
follows:
      (1)   Closed systems
      (2)   Reinforced concrete-lined open channels.
      (3)   Natural channels.
      (4)   Detention facilities.
   (B)   Closed systems.
      (1)   Stormwater runoff shall be carried in storm sewer pipe when either
of the following apply:
         (a)   The runoff can be carried in a pipe of 60 inches in diameter or
smaller; or
         (b)   Where it necessary for the protection of adjacent facilities
that the stormwater be carried in an enclosed facility.
      (2)   Headwalls shall be constructed at the outfall of all storm sewer
systems. Adequate velocity control measures shall be designed to control the
upstream and downstream velocities to prevent erosion. When it is mutually
agreeable to both the city and the owner, a concrete lined channel with
sufficient access easement may be used in lieu of a closed pipe.
   (C)   Reinforced concrete-lined open channels. Reinforced concrete-lined
open channels should be used when the criteria outlined in division (B)(1) is
exceeded.
      (1)   Reinforced concrete lined channels shall conform to the following:
         (a)   Channels draining an area with a “CA” factor of 250 or less
shall be lined with reinforced concrete in a manner which will contain the
design frequency storm, plus one foot of freeboard within the concrete lining.
Where “C” is equal to the runoff coefficient, and “A” is equal to the drainage
area in acres.
         (b)   Channels draining an area with a “CA” factor of more than 250
but less than 500 shall be concrete lined to contain the runoff from a ten-year
return frequency storm with balance of the required design frequency storm
contained within grassed slopes no steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical and with a minimum of one foot freeboard.
         (c)   Channels draining an area with a “CA” factor of more than 500
but less than 2,000 shall be constructed with a reinforced concrete pilot
channel not less than 20 feet in width and having at least an 18-inch vertical
side depth, a six-inch depressed invert, and an appropriate edge protection as
accepted by the City Engineer or his authorized designee. The remainder of the
channel shall consist of earthen side slopes with proper vegetative cover on
slopes not steeper than three to one, nor flatter than 1.5%.
         (d)   In lieu of the improvements of a channel draining an area with a
“CA” factor in excess of 500, the City Council may elect to accept the
dedication of all land within the natural 100-year floodplain of the existing
drainage channel as a permanent drainage right-of-way.
         (e)   That the criteria for drainage improvements as hereinabove set
forth in divisions (a) through (d) above shall be applicable to publicly owned
lands solely at the discretion of the city.
      (2)   The maximum permissible velocities in channels shall conform to the
velocities as shown in Table I set forth in division (E) below, unless
otherwise approved in writing by the City Engineer or his authorized designee.
      (3)   The minimum roughness coefficients for various channels and
floodplains shall conform to the values as shown in Table I set forth in
division (E) below, unless approved in writing by the City Engineer or his
authorized designee.
   (D)   Natural channels. Natural channels may be preserved when the criteria
in division (C)(1)(d) above are met or when the developer desires to preserve
natural channels within his addition for purposes of aesthetics and/or open
space. The following criteria shall apply when natural channels are to be
preserved:
      (1)   An application for preservation of a natural channel shall be
submitted to and approved by the Director of Public Works prior to approval of
the preliminary plat. This application shall contain the following information
furnished by the developer:
         (a)   Topographic, hydrologic and hydraulic information sufficient to
properly evaluate the proposal and showing that:
            1.   Before any site work has begun, all land having elevation
below the 50-year return frequency flood elevation is contained within an
easement dedicated to the public for the purpose of providing drainage;
            2.   The channel easement has a minimum hydraulic capacity to
accommodate a 50-year return frequency storm based on a fully developed
watershed;
            3.   That all minor channel improvements, such as reshaping,
realignment, and the like, are protected with sodding, backsloping, cribbing,
or other bank protection that is designed and constructed to control an
analysis shall also be made to determine the effects of the 100-year flood as
required by §
154.124(G)(3). Any change to a regulatory floodway shall comply with §
154.122(B)(3).
      (2)   When the natural channel to be preserved is one which has had a
floodplain information report prepared on it by FEMA, the 100-year return
frequency storm shall be as shown in that particular report unless otherwise
directed by the City Engineer or his authorized designee.
   (E)   Detention facilities. Detention facilities will be required when the
downstream drainage system is not adequate to carry the increased flow from the
development. The facilities shall be designed to restrict the rate of the 100-
year storm flow to the predevelopment conditions. If there is additional
capacity in the downstream drainage system, the additional capacity will be
prorated based on the area of the contributing drainage areas. The detention
system must be approved by the Director of Public Works for design and method
of operation and maintenance.

§ 154.124 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to establish standard criteria,
principles, procedures and practices for design of storm drainage facilities.
      (1)   The design factors, formulas, graphs and procedures presented or
referred to herein are intended for use as engineering guides in the design of
drainage facilities and in the solution of drainage problems involving
stormwater `quantity, method of collection, transportation and disposal.
      (2)   Methods of design other than those indicated or referred to herein
may be considered in complex and difficult cases where experience clearly
indicated they are preferable; however, these deviations shall not be attempted
until approval has been obtained from the City Engineer or his authorized
designee.
      (3)   The methods outlined or referred to herein include accepted
principles of surface drainage engineering and should be a working supplement
to basic design information obtainable from textbooks and publications on
drainage.
   (B)   Determination of design discharge.
      (1)   The two methods acceptable for use in the city are:
         (a)   Modified rational method (Q=CCaIA) to be used on small
watersheds of 1,000 acres or less, where:
      Q   =   Discharge expressed in cubic feet per second
      C   =   Runoff coefficient (Table III (Division (D)(2) below)
      Ca   =   Antecedent precipitation factor (Table II (§ 154.126))
      I   =   Rainfall intensity in inches per hour (Cleburne, Texas Rainfall
Intensity Curves)
      A   =   Area in acres
         (b)   Unit hydrograph techniques shall be used for areas greater than
1,000 acres. The technique and the data to be used for the determination of the
design discharge shall be approved by the City Engineer or his authorized
designee prior to the calculations being completed. A complete set of all
detail calculations must be submitted to the City Engineer or his authorized
designee for approval prior to completion of the plans for the drainage system.

   (C)   Drainage area.
      (1)   Area of the watershed shall be determined using the information
required by §
154.123(A)(4) and final grading plan.
      (2)   Outline of drainage areas must follow natural drainage features in
nonurbanized areas. Consideration shall be given to manmade features in
urbanized areas.
   (D)   Runoff coefficients.
      (1)   Storm drainage shall be designed for ultimate development of the
watershed and, therefore, runoff coefficients used shall consider these fully
developed conditions. Master plans, zoning maps and land use plans shall be
used to determine the ultimate development.
      (2)   Table III below gives values for runoff coefficients which shall be
used for the determination of stormwater runoff.

   Group C ­ Clay loam, shallow sandy loam
   Group D ­ Heavy plastic clays
 
   (E)   Time of concentration.
      (1)   Time of concentration is defined as the longest time that will be
required for a drop of water to flow from the upper limit of the drainage area
to the point of concentration.
      (2)   Time of concentration is a combination of surface flow time and
time of flow in the storm drainage facility. For over land flow times, the
methods are to be approved by the City Engineer or his authorized designee.
      (3)   Inlet times shall be:
         (a)   Five minutes for property zoned for multiple-family, local
business, central business, commercial or industrial.
         (b)   Ten minutes for property zoned for parks, schools, single-family
residential and duplex.
   (F)   Rainfall intensity.
      (1)   Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves for the city are set
forth on chart reproduced below:

   (G)   Design storm frequency.
      (1)   It is general practice to design city storm drainage systems to
accommodate the runoff from a storm which, on the average, is equaled or
exceeded once every ten or 50 years.
      (2)   Table IV shows the design storm frequencies to be used in the
design of drainage facilities.
      (3)   In connection with the design of facilities such as low point
inlets, culverts, bridges, channels and creeks shown in Table IV set forth in
division (J) below, the discharge for a 100-year return frequency storm and the
resulting possible damages therefrom shall be evaluated to determine if the
damages are sufficient to warrant the enlargement of the planned facility. In
any areas where stormwater runoff concentrates at low points of grade or where
discharge in excess of the design discharge flows across private property, the
following information shall be shown:
         (a)   The 100-year design discharge.
         (b)   The depth of inundation of this discharge.
         (c)   An evaluation of the possible damages resulting from the above
information.
   (H)   Head losses. The design techniques and methods used in the
determination of all head losses shall be approved by the City Engineer or his
authorized designee.
   (I)   Flow in gutters. The drainage capacities of streets and gutters shall
be determined by Manning's Formula using an value of 0.015 for asphalt or 0.013
for concrete streets. Streets shall be designed to flow not more than one inch
above the curb during a ten-year return frequency storm on residential streets.
Collectors and thoroughfares shall maintain a minimum of eight feet of pavement
width above the ten-year frequency.
   (J)   Positive overflow. In areas where positive overflow is not provided
within the street, a concrete flume with a minimum width of four feet with six-
inch curbs shall be required between lots in a drainage easement, near the low
point in the street.
 
Table IV
Type of Facility                       Minimum Design Frequency
Storm sewers (with inlet on grade)     10 years
Storm sewers draining low point inlets 50 years
Culverts, bridges, channels, creeks    50 years
 
   (K)   Flow in storm sewers and channels. The capacity of storm sewers,
culverts, bridges, and open channels shall be determined by the use of the
Manning Formula, and the design of the facility derived accordingly. The
Manning Formula is:
Q = 1.486 r 2/3 s 1/2 A
n
Where:
   Q   =   Discharge, expressed in cubic feet per second
   n   =   Roughness coefficient, based on condition and type of conduit lining
   s   =   Slope of hydraulic gradient, expressed in feet of vertical rise per
foot of horizontal distance
   r   =   Hydraulic radius (area of flow divided by wetted perimeter)
   A   =   Area of flow in conduit, expressed in square feet

§ 154.125 CONSTRUCTION.
   All construction shall be in accordance with the city standard water and
sewerage specifications.
('68 Code, App. B, § 7.06)
§ 154.126 OFF-SITE DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The owner or developer of property to be developed shall be
responsible for all storm drainage flowing on his property. This responsibility
includes the drainage directed to that property by prior development as well as
drainage naturally flowing through the property by reason of topography.
   (B)   Adequate consideration shall be given by the owner in the development
of property to determine how the discharge leaving the proposed development
will affect downstream property.
   (C)   When any proposed development requires the need for off-site grading
or includes areas of two acres or more where stormwater runoff has been
collected or concentrated, whether it be by permanent drainage systems or
streets, it shall not be permitted to drain onto adjacent property except in
existing creeks, channels, storm sewers or streets unless the following is
provided:
      (1)   Notarized letter of permission from the affected property owner; or
      (2)   Proper drainage easements are obtained; or
      (3)   If the owner is unable to acquire the necessary off-site easements,
he shall provide the city with documentation of his efforts, including evidence
of a reasonable offer made to the adjacent property owner. Upon such a written
request for assistance, the city shall attempt to acquire these easements
through negotiations. If the negotiations are unsuccessful, the request may, at
the developer's option, be submitted to Council for consideration of
acquisition through condemnation. In either case, the total cost of the
acquisition and the cost of the easements shall be paid by the owner
(developer); or
      (4)   If the developer is unable to obtain either number one or number
two above and chooses not to pursue city assistance as outlined in number three
above, he shall provide the city with documentation of his efforts. The
developer will then execute a notarized letter. Said letter shall be in a form
approved by the city attorney and shall provide that the developer shall agree
to save and hold harmless the city from any and all claims or suits for damage
arising out of the required grading and/or concentrations of flow. The city
reserves the right to require the notarized letter of permission or easement
from the affected property owner prior to construction.
   (D)   (1)   The subdivider shall pay for the cost of all drainage
improvements required for the development of his subdivision, including any
necessary off-site channels or storm sewers and acquisition of the required
easements, in which only divisions (C)(2) and (3) above shall apply.
      (2)   In areas where the proposed off-site improvements are to be made
within existing city right-of-way, an estimate of these off-site costs shall be
prepared and submitted along with the plans. Subject to Council approval, cost
for such off-site improvements shall be prorated to the extent that the owner
pays for percentage of the off-site cost based on the increase of the discharge
originating within the limits of his addition.
   (E)   Where it is anticipated that additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision or development will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, whether natural or manmade, and result in
hazardous conditions, the Planning Commission and/or Council may withhold
approval of the subdivision or development until appropriate provision has been
made to accommodate the problem, and plans shall be provided which include all
necessary modifications to on-site improvements and/or off-site improvements
including storm sewer systems, channel grading, driveway adjustments, culvert
improvements, detention facilities, and the like.
('68 Code, App. B, § 7.07) (Ord. 8-1989-34, passed 8-8-89)
§ 154.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation who shall violate any of the
provisions of this ordinance or who shall fail to comply with any provision
hereof within the corporate limits of the city shall be guilty of a class C
misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed
$1,000, and each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense and shall be punishable accordingly.
('68 Code, App. B, § 8.04)
   (B)   A developer shall give at least 24-hours' notice to the City Engineer
of intent to commence actual construction of the community facilities as set
forth in §
154.061 so that inspection personnel can be made available. The developer may
be fined up to $200 per day each violation for failure to comply with this
provision.

SUPPLEMENTARY ZONING PROVISIONS
§ 155.15 LOCATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   A person commits an offense if he operates or causes to be operated a
sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of any of the following:
      (1)   A school;
      (2)   A boundary of a residential or historic district as defined in this
chapter;
      (3)   A public park;
      (4)   The property line of a lot devoted to a residential use as defined
in this chapter;
      (5)   A hospital;

      (7)   Buildings and property owned or leased by the city, county, state
or federal government; or
      (8)   A cemetery.
      (9)   A state highway.
   (B)   A person commits a misdemeanor if he or she causes or permits the
operation, establishment, substantial enlargement, or transfer of ownership or
control of a sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of another sexually
oriented business.
   (C)   A person commits a misdemeanor if he or she causes or permits the
operation, establishment, or maintenance of more than one sexually oriented
business in the same building, structure, or portion thereof, or if he or she
causes or permits the increase of floor area of any sexually oriented business
in any building, structure, or portion thereof containing another sexually
oriented business.
   (D)   For the purposes of divisions (A) and (B) of this section, measurement
shall be made in accordance with the city's zoning ordinance.
   (E)   For purposes of division (B) of this section, the distance between any
two sexually oriented businesses shall be measured in a straight line, without
regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest exterior wall of
the structure in which each business is located.
   (F)   Any sexually oriented business lawfully operating on the passage of
this ordinance that is in violation of divisions (A), (B), or (C) of this
section shall be deemed a nonconforming use. The nonconforming use will be
permitted to continue for a period not to exceed 18 months, unless sooner
terminated for any reason or voluntarily discontinued for a period of 30 days
or more. Such nonconforming uses shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or
altered except that the use may be changed to a conforming use. If two or more
sexually oriented businesses are within 1,000 feet of one another and otherwise
in a permissible location, the sexually oriented business which was first
established and continually operating at a particular location is the
conforming use and the later-established business(es) is nonconforming.
   (G)   A sexually oriented business fully operating as a conforming use is
not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent to the grant or
renewal of the sexually oriented business license, of a church, school,
licensed day-care center, government building, cemetery or hospital within
1,000 feet of the sexually oriented business. This provision applies only to
the renewal of a valid license, and does not apply when an application for a
license is submitted after a license has expired or has been revoked.

§ 155.83 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS FOR ALTERATIONS OR NEW CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   No person shall carry out any exterior alteration, restoration,
demolition, reconstruction, new construction or relocation of a landmark, or
make changes in the exterior appearance of such landmark, visible from a public
right-of-way (excluding ordinary maintenance and repairs as described in §
155.81) which affects the appearance and cohesiveness of the historic landmark,
without first applying for a Certificate of Appropriateness from the
Commission, or as permitted by the Historic Preservation Officer, as described
in this section. The Commission shall have the authority to review all
applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness and shall issue or decline to
issue the certificate after conducting a public hearing and providing notice as
stipulated herein. The applicant may appeal Officer denials to the Commission.
   (B)   No building permit shall be issued for proposed work until a
Certificate of Appropriateness has first been issued by the Historic
Preservation Officer or the Commission applicable. The Certificate of
Appropriateness required by this subchapter shall be in addition to and not in
lieu of any building permit that may be required by any other ordinance of the
city.
   (C)   In considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness,
approval or denial shall be guided by any adopted design guidelines or
construction standards and, where applicable, the following criteria from the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Rehabilitation of Historic
Buildings. Adopted design guidelines and Secretary of the Interior's Standards
shall be made available to the owners of historic landmarks.
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to adapt the property in a
manner which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, object, or
site and its environment.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, object, or site and its environment shall be preserved, when
feasible. The removal or alteration of historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures, objects, and sites shall be recognized
as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an appearance of an earlier architectural design period
shall be discouraged. Such alterations shall be permitted only with approval by
the Commission after consideration of a detailed and written explanation
regarding the need for such alteration.
      (4)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, object, or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their
own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsman
which characterize a building, structure, object, or site shall be kept where
possible.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should reflect the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features,
substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Subject property owner is not responsible for other's property.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment. Such alterations and additions
shall be reviewed by the Commission at a public hearing.
      (10)   The Commission shall give mailed notice to owners of the proposed
historic landmark and those within 200 feet of the proposed historic landmark,
such notice to be given, not less than ten days before the date set for
hearing.
      (11)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings,
structures, objects, or sites shall be done in such a manner that if such
additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the building, structure, object, or site would be unimpaired.
   (D)   Administrative approval. The Historic Preservation Officer shall
approve a Certificate of Appropriateness if the requested construction is not
considered to be substantive and does not address the physical alterations or
visual appearance of the designated historical landmark.
   (E)   The Historic Preservation Officer may request that the Commission
consider any request as deemed appropriate.
   (F)   Administrative staff shall not deny a Certificate of Appropriateness,
but shall forward any such application to the Commission for consideration.
   (G)   If the requested construction is considered to be substantive and does
not meet the recommended design guidelines, or if there are written objections
to the application, the Historic Preservation Officer shall forward the request
to the Commission for action.
   (H)   Historic Preservation Commission action. The Commission shall conduct
a public meeting regarding a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The
Commission shall approve the permit, deny the permit, or approve with
modification.
      (1)   The Commission shall give published and mailed notice to owners of
the requested Certificate of Appropriateness and those within 200 feet of the
proposed historic landmark, such notice to be given, not less than ten days
before the date set for hearing.
      (2)   If approved, decisions of the Commission shall state all findings
pertaining to the approval or modification of the application. A copy shall be
sent to the applicant. Additional copies shall be filed as part of the public
record on that property and dispersed to appropriate city departments, such as
building inspections.
      (3)   Denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall only be granted by
the Commission.
   (I)   Commission hearing. If a Certificate of Appropriateness is recommended
for denial by the Historic Preservation Officer, the Commission shall schedule
a public hearing to take action to approve, approve with modification, or deny
the application.
   (J)   Application. The application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
shall contain:
      (1)   Name, address, telephone number of applicant, detailed description
of proposed work;
      (2)   Location and current photograph of the property and adjacent
properties;
      (3)   Historic photographs of the property, if available;
      (4)   Elevation drawings of proposed changes, if available;
      (5)   Samples of materials to be used;
      (6)   If the proposal includes signs or lettering, a scaled drawing
showing the type of lettering to be used, all dimensions and colors, a
description of materials to be used, method of illumination (if any), and a
plan showing the sign's location on the property; and
      (7)   Other information which the city administrative staff, or
Commission may deem necessary to review the proposed work.

§ 155.84 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED FOR DEMOLITION.
   A permit for the demolition of a designated landmark shall not be granted by
the Building Official or other city official without the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness as provided for in Certificate of
Appropriateness for alterations or new construction contained herein.
   (A)   Architectural design guidelines. In considering an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission shall be guided by any design
guidelines and or construction standards approved by the City Council.
   (B)   Ordinary maintenance. No regulations provided herein shall be
construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any exterior
architectural feature of a designated historic landmark which does not involve
a change in design material or outward appearance, including but not limited
to, change in exterior paint color. In-kind replacement or repair is included
in this definition of ordinary maintenance.
   (C)   Demolition by neglect. No owner, responsible party, or persons with an
interest in a designated historic landmark shall permit the property to fall
into a serious state of disrepair, such that the result of such deterioration
of any exterior architectural feature would produce a detrimental effect upon
the character of the landmark itself. Such deteriorated condition shall
include:
      (1)   Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports;

§ 155.90 DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL HISTORIC
LANDMARKS.
   (A)   Adoption of design guidelines. Pursuant to §§
155.80 through
155.87 hereof, Historic Landmarks, the City Council adopts the following design
guidelines for residential and non-residential buildings which are designated
as historic landmarks. Such design guidelines shall be applicable in addition
to the Secretary of Interior's standards for the rehabilitation of historic
buildings. If there is a conflict between these design guidelines and the
Secretary of the Interior's standards for the rehabilitation of historic
buildings, the most restrictive regulations shall apply.
   (B)   Elements of design guidelines. These guidelines focus on the following
elements for work that is to be done on residential or non-residential
structures which are designated historic landmarks:
      (1)   Color;
      (2)    Roof styles;
      (3)    Ornamental features;
      (4)    Porches;
      (5)    Windows;
      (6)    Exterior materials; and
      (7)    Fences.
   (C)   Color. Colors shall be used to maintain the character of the area
where the historic landmark is located and to complement and promote the
heritage of both residential and non-residential construction. The color of the
exterior surfaces of historic landmark structures is one of the factors with
the greatest visual impact. The colors for the trim and primary structure shall
be tones that reflect the time period of the original construction. These
colors are readily available from major paint suppliers and usually are
categorized into a selection grouping for compatibility. The primary colors may
be used in combination with each other to provide contrasting trim colors.
Painting of structures totally in one paint color scheme is strongly
discouraged and will be addressed at the time of consideration of any
application.
   (D)   Roof styles. An important element of the visual presentation of a
structure is the style and construction of the roof. The character of the roof
must be compatible with the general period of construction.
      (1)   Residential roof styles. The roof and pitch of the roof shall be in
keeping with traditional types and styles in use in historic residential areas
of the city. If repaired or replaced, the original pitch and style are
required. Some of these roof types include a gable with such variations as the
“clipped gable” and “saltbox.” These also include the hip with such variations
as “gable on hip.”
         (a)   Any of these traditional roof types is acceptable without the
need to duplicate the predominant roof type of a specific area since part of
the charm of the city streetscape is the variety of roof styles and pitches.
Acceptable materials include slate, asphalt shingle, and simulated shingles.
Wood shingles must be approved by the Fire Marshal.
         (b)   Original roof materials and color shall be retained for
replacement of a roof when at all possible. The color and texture of shingles
shall be appropriate to the architectural style and period of the structure.
      (2)   Non-residential roof styles. Non-residential historic landmark
structures located in the downtown area should typically have a flat roof with
parapet walls along the front and sides. Pitch roofs for non-residential
historic landmark structures are permitted in transitional areas where
residential structures are located. Pitch roofs are preferred for historic
landmark church structures but are not required. Metal roofs on historic
landmark structures located in transition areas may be of metal construction
only if such construction is standing seam of a green, bronze, or other color
pertaining to the time period. Changes to the roof type or material of any
historic landmark structure, residential or non-residential, requires review
recommendation and approval of the Commission and other bodies, as may be
required by this subchapter.
   (E)   Architectural detail. Architectural details help establish the
character of historic structures. These details are unique to the period of
time which the Commission is seeking to preserve.
      (1)   Architectural details are those items that add to the basic
features of the construction of an historic landmark to give the structure its
own unique character and signature. These features may be items such as window
and door trim styles, corner pilasters, gable peak ornamentation, lattice work,
balustrades, traditional paneled and louvered wooden shutters and similar
details.
      (2)   The applicant is encouraged to extend the design style of the
existing historic landmark structure to any addition, and, in the case of
alteration of an existing historic landmark structure, the architectural
details of the exterior shall be preserved. Changes that have taken place in
the course of time which are evidence of the history and development of the
building and the environment may have acquired significance in their own right;
and their significance shall be recognized and respected. Architectural details
of any period or style not original to the building shall not be introduced.
Commercial historic landmark structures shall demonstrate detail on parapet
walls, windows, doors, trim and brick work.
   (F)   Porches. Porches are one of the most important characteristics of
residential structures. Nonresidential structures also have specific treatments
to the front of the structure which are of similar importance.
      (1)   Porches on historic landmark structures in residential areas are
encouraged and shall be retained. Porches are an integral part of the original
design of a historic residence. They are often the most important design
element on the front of a residence. It is important to preserve the historic
integrity of a residence by retaining original elements such as posts,
balustrades and steps. New construction shall incorporate these elements into
the design of the new structure.
      (2)   It is recommended that new rooms added to historic landmark
structures be constructed to the rear of the house where they are not visible
from the street. If it is unavoidable to enclose a porch, all supporting posts,
railings, and other decorative features shall be retained. A design that is
easily reversible shall be considered. Porches shall not be enclosed with glass
or walls or any other material. The only acceptable material is screening.
   (G)   Windows. The style and type of windows helps to establish the
historical character of residential and non-residential structures. The primary
emphasis shall be on windows that are visible from public spaces.
      (1)   Residential.  
         (a)   Windows are a defining character of the heritage of a designated
historic landmark structure. Alterations or additions to historic landmarks
shall have windows that are compatible with the existing and surrounding
structures. Most original structures which are historic landmarks feature
double hung wood windows and some newer structures feature an assortment of
casement windows.
         (b)   As a general policy the following standards shall be observed
when work is done on a residential historic landmark structure:
            1.   The original shape of the window shall be maintained.
            2.   The original number and arrangement of panes should be
maintained.
            3.    The characteristic window shape shall reflect the period of
construction.
            4.    Aluminum storm windows and screens are appropriate. Blind
stop storm windows painted to match sash color are preferred.
            5.    Shutters, unless appropriate to the style of the building,
shall not be introduced. Shutters shall fill an opening in height and width so
that if they were closed, the opening would be covered.
            6.    Window openings shall not be introduced unless they match the
existing window configuration, and their placement harmonizes with the existing
pattern of the openings.
            7.    Original windows shall not be filled in.
      (2)   Non-residential. 
         (a)   Similar to residential structures, windows on non-residential
designated historic landmark structures are an integral part of the character
of the structure. The window types must be consistent with the style. The
windows and the entrance are a principle feature for this style.
         (b)   Similar to policies for residential windows, the following shall
be observed when work is done on a non-residential historic landmark structure:
            1.    The original shape of the window shall be maintained.
            2.    The original number and arrangement of panes should be
maintained.
            3.   The characteristic window shape shall reflect the period of
construction.
            4.    Window openings shall not be introduced unless they match the
existing window configuration and their placement harmonizes with the existing
placement pattern of the openings.
            5.    Original windows shall not be filled in.
   (H)   Exterior materials. Exterior treatment of walls is critical in
residential structures.
      (1)   Many of the structures in historic areas were originally
constructed with wood exteriors. To support the character of designated
historic landmarks, wood is preferred for exterior repairs, additions, and new
construction, when it is consistent with the existing exterior surface.
Materials that mimic the appearance of wood may be utilized so long as the
historic exterior appearance of historic landmarks are maintained in all cases.
      (2)   As a general policy, the following standards shall be observed:
         (a)    Trim and detailing shall not be removed unless being repaired
or replaced with compatible material of the time period.
         (b)    Replacement wood siding shall replicate the materials,
dimensions, lap dimensions, detailing and placement patterns of the original.
         (c)    Artificial siding, including, but not limited to, vinyl,
aluminum, and artificial brick and stone may be used only when it is deemed
absolutely necessary, and in such cases, the visual historic character of the
structure must be maintained.
         (d)    Painting of original brick is inappropriate unless it is
mismatched or so deteriorated that it cannot withstand weather. If painting is
necessary, original brick colors shall be used.
         (e)    Decorative shingles on the entire exterior of a structure may
not be used, unless historic documentation exists that indicates such usage.
         (f)    Covering original brick of non-residential structures with
aluminum or false fronts including mansard-type awnings shall not be permitted.
Any remodeling or reconstruction of structures with this treatment shall
include removal of aluminum siding and false fronts.
   (I)   Fences. Materials used for enclosures of residential property often
reflect the character of the neighborhood.
      (1)   Fences in the front yard of an historic landmark structure are a
decorative element. As a rule, the fence regulations adopted by the city shall
govern fences unless otherwise provided herein.
      (2)   As a general policy, the following standards shall be applicable to
fences in the yards of historic landmark structures:
         (a)   Metal fences located in the front yard shall be decorative iron
material, and no chain link fences are permitted in the front yard.
         (b)   Wood-picket fences are appropriate in front and rear yards of
houses when they are consistent with the architectural style of the main
structure. Board fences, with the boards spaced closely together, are
appropriate only around rear yards.
         (c)   New front yard fences shall be open in character so as to not
create a visual barrier between the main structure and the public street.
         (d)   New decorative fences placed in the front yard shall not exceed
a height of 42 inches.
         (e)   Fences located in the front yard shall have an appropriate
transition to fences located in the rear and side yards. Transitions may be
accomplished by gradually increasing the height to the height of the rear yard
fence, incorporating landscaping to aid in the transition, or extending the
character of the decorative fence into the rear of the side yard.
   (J)   New construction. The following general policies shall be observed for
any new construction of a residential or non-residential structure designated
as a historic landmark:
      (1)   These guidelines apply only to the exterior of buildings and to
areas of lots visible from the public rights-of-way.
      (2)   New structures shall be constructed to the same scale and style as
structures in the surrounding area so that they are compatible with such other
structures.
      (3)   Outbuildings, garages and storage buildings shall reflect the
character of the existing residence and surrounding structures and shall be
compatible with the existing residence in terms of height, scale, roof shape,
materials, texture, and details. The location and design of outbuildings shall
not be visually disruptive to the character of the surrounding buildings.
      (4)   The appearance of new construction, including driveways, sidewalks,
lighting, fences, and walls, shall be visually compatible with the environment
of the existing structures and sites to which they relate.
   (K)   Exterior materials.
      (1)   Any construction of exterior walls for any historic landmark
structure shall be of exterior fire resistant construction having at least 75%
of the total exterior walls above grade level, excluding doors and windows,
constructed of masonry or other equivalent material, in accordance with the
city’s building and fire codes. Strict adherence to this requirement shall not
be such as to prevent architectural integrity of the period.
      (2)   Standards for masonry construction types on historic landmark
structures are listed below:
         (a)    Stone material.  Masonry construction using stone material may
consist of granite, marble, limestone, slate, river rock, and other hard and
durable naturally occurring all weather stone. Cut stone and dimensioned stone
techniques are acceptable.
         (b)    Brick material.  Brick material used for masonry construction
shall be hard fired (kiln fired) clay or slate material which meets the latest
version of ASTM standard C2l6, standard specification for facing brick (solid
masonry unit made of clay or shale), and shall be severe weather (SW) grade,
and Type FBA or FBS or better. Unfired clay, sand, or shale brick are not
allowed.
         (c)   Concrete masonry units.  Concrete masonry units used for masonry
construction shall meet the latest version of the following applicable
specifications: ASTM C90, standard specification for hollow load bearing
concrete masonry units; ASTM Cl45, standard specification for solid load
bearing masonry units; ASTM Cl29, standard specification for hollow and solid
nonload bearing units. Concrete masonry units shall have an indented, hammered,
split face finish or other similar architectural finish. Lightweight concrete
block or cinder block construction is not acceptable as an exterior finish.
         (d)    Concrete panel construction.  Concrete finish, pre-cast panel,
tilt wall, or cement composition reinforced panel construction shall be
painted, fluted, or exposed aggregate. Smooth or non-textured concrete finishes
are not acceptable unless painted.
         (e)   Glass and metal standards.  Glass walls shall include glass
curtain walls or glass block construction. “Glass curtain wall” means an
exterior wall which carries no structural loads, and may consist of a
combination of metal, glass, or other surfacing material supported in a metal
framework.

Administrator to initiate the error correction process.
         2.   If the correction involves the redesignation of property or the
relocation of a zoning district boundary, the Zoning Administrator will process
the error correction as a zoning map amendment according to subsection 5.05.
Zoning Text and Map Amendments.
         3.   If the correction involves the correction of a typographical or
scrivener's error or updating the depiction of a property boundary that will
not result in the redesignation of any property or the relocation of any zoning
district boundary, the Zoning Administrator may update the Official Zoning
District Map.
         4.   The updated Official Zoning District Map will replace the
previous Official Zoning District Map.
         5.   The Zoning Administrator will record the change consistent with
subsection 1.04.B.
         6.   If, after application of the correction process, uncertainty
still exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown
on the Official Zoning District Map, the conflict shall be resolved by
utilizing the appeal power of the Board of Adjustment. If, because of error or
omission in the Official Zoning District Map, any property in the city is not
shown as being in a zoning district, such property shall be classified as SF-
20, Single-Family Dwelling District.
   1.04.   Zoning District Boundaries.
      A.   Boundary delineations. The zoning district boundary lines shown on
the Official Zoning District Map are usually along streets, alleys, property
lines, or extensions of these features. Where uncertainty exists as to the
boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning District Map, the
Zoning Administrator will apply the following rules of interpretation:
         1.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerline.
         2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
         3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the city limits
shall be construed as following the city limits.
         4.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be
construed to follow the centerline of the railroad right-of- way.
         5.   Boundaries indicated as following the centerline of creeks,
streams, or drainage ways shall be construed to follow such centerline as
officially designated or recorded. If the centerline of the creek, stream, or
drainage way is not designated or recorded and the centerline changes, the
boundary shall be construed to move with such centerline.
         6.   Boundaries indicated as following the shorelines of lakes or
ponds shall be construed as following the shoreline of the lake or pond
depicted on the Official Zoning District Map.
         7.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
listed in subsection 1.04.A.1 through 1.04.A.6 shall be construed as following
the extension of those features.
         8.   The scale of the Official Zoning District Map shall determine
distances not indicated on the Official Zoning District Map.
         9.   Whenever City Council, by official action, vacates any street,
alley, or public way, the zoning district line adjoining each side of the
street, alley, or public way shall automatically extend to the centerline of
the vacated street, alley, or public way. All areas within the abandoned
street, alley, or public way are subject to all regulations of the extended
districts.
         10.   The zoning classification applied to a tract of land or lot
abutting a street extends automatically to the street centerline.
         11.   If physical features on the ground vary with information shown
on the Official Zoning District Map, or a question arises regarding zoning
boundary interpretation that the Zoning Administrator cannot resolve by
applying the rules of this subsection 1.04.A, the City Council shall classify
the zoning designation and boundary following a public hearing and
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      B.   Zoning upon annexation (zoned vs. interim).
         1.   All territory annexed to the city hereafter shall be temporarily
designated as A, Agricultural District until permanently zoned by City Council.
         2.   City Council shall establish zoning for any property it annexes
into the city as soon as practicable after annexation to give the newly annexed
territory a permanent zoning classification and the procedures to be followed
shall be the same as provided by law for the amendment of the zoning ordinance.
         3.   The owner of land annexed into the city may request a zoning
designation within six months with no fee applied to the request. If the owner
does not request a different zoning designation within six months of the
annexation action, the city will apply any fees typically associated with a
zoning change under subsection 5.05.
         4.   In an annexed area temporarily classified as A, Agricultural
District, no construction of a building other than those allowed in the A,
Agricultural District shall be permitted unless such construction has been
specifically authorized by Council and a permit issued. Construction of
buildings other than those permitted in A, Agricultural District may be
authorized in newly annexed areas prior to permanent zoning only in the
following manner:
            a.   An application for any use shall be made to the Zoning
Administrator. The application shall show the use contemplated, a plat showing
the size of the lot or tract of land proposed to be used, and the location,
size, and type of buildings proposed to be constructed.
            b.   Such application shall be referred by the Zoning Administrator
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration.
            c.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make its
recommendation to the City Council after giving due consideration to the land
use plan for the area in which the application is located.
            d.   Whenever such a recommendation is filed with the City Council,
it shall be advisory only and the City Council may grant or deny the
application as the facts may justify.
            e.   If approved by the City Council, the applicant may apply for a
building permit provided the building permit application is consistent with
City Council authorization.
   1.05.   Compliance Required; Interpretation; Rules of Construction.
      A.   Compliance required. This Zoning Ordinance applies to all land,
buildings, structures, or appurtenances located within the City of Cleburne
that are in any way occupied, used, erected, altered, removed, placed,
demolished, or converted from one form or use to another.
      B.   Interpretation.
         1.   Restrictiveness. When the regulations in this Zoning Ordinance
conflict with conditions of another applicable law, ordinance, resolution,
rule, or regulation, the Zoning Administrator will apply the more restrictive
regulation where authorized by law.
         2.   Abrogation of private agreement. These Zoning Ordinance
regulations do not abrogate any easement, covenant, or other private agreement.
         3.   Cumulative effect. These Zoning Ordinance regulations are
cumulative. Where allowed by law, and where these regulations address the
subject matter of a resolution or ordinance, these regulations may impose
additional limitations upon existing resolutions and ordinances or those that
City Council may adopt in the future.
      C.   Rules of construction. The following rules of construction will
determine the interpretation of these Zoning Ordinance regulations:
         1.   Person or entity. “Person” includes any individual, developer,
corporation, organization, trust, LLC, or other entity authorized under these
Zoning Ordinance regulations to submit a development or zoning application.
         2.   Number. The singular number includes the plural and the plural
the singular.
         3.   Tense. The present tense includes the past and future tenses, and
the future the present.
         4.   Mandatory and permissive language. The words “shall” and “must”

         5.   Gender terms. Where any term includes a gender-specific pronoun,
the use of that term includes all gender.
         6.   Parentheses. Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the same
section, any word, term, number, abbreviation, or acronym that appears in
parentheses directly after a word, term, number, or phrase is intended to be
construed in the same sense as the word, term, number, or phrase that appears
immediately before the parenthetical. (For example, in the phrase "three (3)
feet," the written "three" and the parenthetical "(3)" are intended to
communicate the same distance in both a written and numeric format and are not
to be construed as separate units of distance.)
         7.   Conflicts. If there is a conflict between one or more sections of
this Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator will interpret the applicable
regulation according to the following rules:
            a.   The applicable written text in the body of the Zoning
Ordinance controls over any charts, graphics, or footnotes in the Zoning
Ordinance; and
            b.   If a conflict arises between Section 155.2, Zoning Districts
and other sections in these Zoning Ordinance regulations, the other section
will govern.

and assembly of products or equipment, along with uses such as distribution,
rail, and intermodal facilities.
            b.   Uses within the I, Industrial District are presumed to utilize
large equipment and semi-trucks and should be located along arterial or
collector roadway corridors to maximize access and minimize truck traffic
through existing or future residential and retail areas.
            c.   Because of the nature of the products or character of
activities, uses in the district may produce sound, dust, vibration, or odors
beyond the boundaries of the property on which the use is located. These uses
should be buffered by similar uses where possible and located away from areas
that are primarily residential, retail, or mixed-use.
         2.   Permitted uses and use regulations. See the Use Chart and all
applicable regulations.
         3.   Dimensional standards. See subsection 2.05.B Dimensional
Standards for Nonresidential Districts and all applicable regulations in

   3.07.   Nonconformities.
      A.   Intent of provisions.
         1.   Existence of nonconformities.
            a.   Nonconformities are uses, buildings, structures, lots, or
additions that do not conform to the standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
            b.   This subsection 3.07 establishes the process for bringing
nonconformities into compliance with this Zoning Ordinance while respecting the
property owner's rights and investment-backed expectations.
            c.   This subsection does not attempt to distinguish "legally
nonconforming" from "illegally nonconforming."
               (1)   Nonconformities are considered qualified under this
subsection 3.07 if the city issued a permit or otherwise allowed for their
initiation or construction under regulations existing at the time a permit was
issued or an allowance was made.
               (2)   Nonconformities that are permissible under this Zoning
Ordinance but are initiated or constructed without a permit must cease
operation until the city issues a permit.
               (3)   Nonconformities that are not permissible are in violation
of this Zoning Ordinance and must be removed or cease operation immediately.
            d.   The property owner is responsible for demonstrating that the
use, building, structure, lot, or addition in question complied with the
standards in place at the time of its inception or construction and became
nonconforming due to the adoption of new standards after its inception or
construction.
            e.   If the City Council believes that a nonconforming use is
harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of neighboring properties or the
general public and will not comply in a timely manner with the regulations of
this Zoning Ordinance, the Council may initiate the amortization of
nonconforming uses process as outlined in subsection 5.10.
         2.   Categories of nonconformities. Nonconformities occur in three
general categories, or combination thereof.
            (1)   Nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use occurs when an
existing use is no longer allowed in a zoning district.
            (2)   Nonconforming structures. A nonconforming building or
structure can have a lesser setback, yard width, height, or lot area or
dimension requirement than required by the Zoning Ordinance.
            (3)   Nonconforming lots. A nonconforming lot can be nonconforming
as to lot area or dimension requirement.
         3.   Continuation of nonconformities.
            a.   Nonconformities are hereby declared incompatible with the
uses, structures, and lots authorized under this Zoning Ordinance.
            b.   It is the declared intent of this subsection that
nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures eventually be eliminated and be
required to comply with the regulations of the Zoning Ordinance, having due
regard for the property rights of the person affected, the public welfare, and
the character of the surrounding area.
            c.   The owner of a nonconforming use, nonconforming structure, or
nonconforming lot is only allowed to maintain, repair, or alter the use,
building, structure, or lot in conformity with the provisions of this
subsection 3.07.
      B.   Summary of nonconforming regulations.

      C.   Existing platted lots are conforming lots. Any existing vacant lot
platted prior to the Zoning Ordinance effective date that was conforming at the
time it was platted or replatted is considered a conforming lot for the
purposes of constructing a single-family residence.
      D.   Changing uses.
         1.   Changing a nonconforming use to a conforming use. Any
nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Once a conforming use is
established and the nonconforming use ceases, the use shall not change back to
a nonconforming use.
         2.   Changing nonconforming use to another nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
         3.   Establishing a conforming use in a nonconforming structure. Where
a conforming use is located in a nonconforming structure, the use may be
changed to another conforming use by the process outlined in subsection 3.07.E
Expansion of Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
      E.   Expansion of nonconforming uses and structures. An expansion of a
nonconforming use or nonconforming structure is allowed in accordance with the
following provisions.
         1.   Prohibited expansion or reoccupation. A nonconforming use or
nonconforming structure shall not be expanded or increased on or after the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, except as provided in subsection
3.07.E Expansion of Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
         2.   Nonconforming use expansion in existing building. A nonconforming
use may be enlarged, increased, or extended within an existing building
provided:
            a.   No structural alteration may be made on or in the existing
building except those required by law to preserve the building in a
structurally sound condition.
            b.   Work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 50% of the current replacement
value of the building.
            c.   The number of dwelling units or rooms in a nonconforming
residential use shall not be increased so as to exceed the number of dwelling
units or rooms existing at the time the use became a nonconforming use.
         3.   Nonconforming use prohibited from expansion beyond existing
building.
            a.   A nonconforming use established within any building shall not
be extended to occupy any land outside the building.
            b.   A nonconforming use established outdoors on a platted lot may
expand within the platted lot if the expansion does not increase the degree of
nonconformity to applicable sections of this Zoning Ordinance or City Code
regarding nuisances; emission of sound, vibration, glare, or particulate
matter; height; setbacks; or outside storage located in a front yard.
         4.   Substandard lot, parcel, or tract and substandard replatting
exemptions.
            a.   Substandard lots. The minimum lot requirements for the various
zoning districts listed in Section
155.2 shall be in accordance with their respective districts, except that the
owner of a lot having less area than required by the Zoning Ordinance may
construct an authorized use if the lot was an official Lot of Record prior to
April 12, 2022, or an official Lot of Record within the CI, Commercial/
Industrial Flex District prior to the effective date of this ordinance.
            b.   Substandard parcels or tracts. A substandard parcel or tract
is an unplatted piece of property that was created by a deed or other
conveyance, and cannot comply with the minimum lot area and width requirements
for the zoning district in which the property is located, and does not qualify
as a lot of record under this Zoning Ordinance.
               (1)   To be entitled to the rights afforded by this subsection
b, a substandard parcel or tract must be recorded in the county real property
records before March 22, 1996 and must:
                  (a)   Have an area of not less than 4,000 square feet;
                  (b)   Be not less than 40 feet wide, or 25 feet wide for a
parcel or tract in the DTC, Downtown Core Overlay, measured at the street or at
the building line; and
                  (c)   Have frontage on an existing street.
               (2)   A substandard parcel or tract may be used for a detached
single-family residential use if the use is permitted in the zoning district in
which the property is located and the parcel or tract complies with the
requirements of this subsection 3.07.E.4.b.
               (3)   Building setback requirements.
                  (a)   Front yard setbacks shall comply with regulations
established in subsection 2.05.A or the established build line, as applicable.
                  (b)   Rear yard setbacks shall be 10% of the lot depth or ten
feet, whichever is greater.
                     (i)   No rear yard shall be less than ten feet.
                     (ii)   No rear yard shall be required to be more than 20
feet.
                  (c)   Side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of 10% of the lot
width, and may not be less than five feet.
                  (d)   Corner lots with a side yard setback adjacent to a
street shall be a minimum of ten feet or 20% of the lot width, whichever is
less.
               (4)   Development of a substandard parcel or tract shall comply
with all additional provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
               (5)   The Building Official may issue a building permit for a
substandard parcel or tract, and no plat shall be required.
               (6)   This subsection b does not apply if a substandard parcel
or tract is used with one or more contiguous parcels, tracts, or lots for a
single use or development, and the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance apply
to the aggregation of the property as if the aggregation were a single parcel,
tract, or lot.
               (7)   A substandard parcel or tract that is aggregated with
other property to form a site may not be disaggregated after December 10, 2019,
to form a site that is smaller than the minimum lot area requirement under
subsection 2.05.A.
            c.   Substandard replatting exemptions. Existing lots of record
that are of insufficient size to construct a single-family dwelling may be
replatted with adjacent existing lots of record if the resulting lots meet the
criteria listed in section 3.07.E.4.c.1 below.
               (1)   For properties in the SF-7 District, existing platted lots
that are considered non-conforming may be replatted and approved
administratively if the replat qualifies as a minor replat and all newly
created or replatted lots meet at least one of the following required minimum
lot dimensions listed below:
                  (a)   Lot width;
                  (b)   Lot depth; or
                  (c)   Lot size.
               (2)   For properties in the SF-7 District, existing platted lots
proposed to be replatted that qualify as a minor replat but require a variance
to all three of the lot dimension requirements listed in subsection
3.07.E.4.c.1 above, must be approved by City Council, following a
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, as outlined in
Ch. 154 of this code.
               (3)   Development of a substandard replatted lot shall comply
with all other requirements of the SF-7 District.
         5.   Expansion of nonconforming structures with conforming uses.
Buildings or structures that do not conform to the regulations or development
standards in the Zoning Ordinance may only increase or expand the nonconforming
structure in compliance with this Zoning Ordinance. A nonconforming structure
shall not increase in extent or degree of nonconformity.
         6.   Removal of nonconforming structure. Removal of all or a portion
of a nonconforming structure, regardless of intent, forfeits the portion of the
structure that was removed. The owner may not reconstruct the portion of the
structure that was removed except in conformance with this Zoning Ordinance.
      F.   Nonconforming regarding parking or landscaping.
         1.   Nonconforming regarding parking requirements. This subsection
3.07.F.1 applies when:
            a.   A nonconforming use is replaced by a conforming use;
            b.   A nonconforming structure is occupied by a conforming use; or
            c.   An existing parking facility becomes nonconforming by the
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance.
               (1)   Whenever a building or use is enlarged in area, number of
units, seating capacity, or in any other way that increases required parking,
and the parking required by the new use exceeds available parking on site by
25% or less, the building or use shall meet the applicable parking and fire
lane requirements of subsection 4.03 and all newly installed parking surfaces
shall meet the pavement requirements of subsection 4.03.
               (2)   Whenever a building or use is enlarged in area, number of
units, seating capacity, or in any other way that increases required parking,
and the parking required by the new use exceeds available parking on site by
more than 25% but equal to or less than 50%, the building or use shall meet the
applicable parking and fire lane requirements of subsection 4.03 and the entire
parking area, new and existing, shall meet the requirements of subsection 4.03.
               (3)   If the expansion increases the required parking to more
than ten spaces, the entire parking area must be fully landscaped with islands
and perimeter buffers as required in subsection 4.01.
         2.   Nonconforming regarding landscaping requirements. This subsection
3.07.F.2 applies when:
            a.   A nonconforming use is replaced by a conforming use that
requires additional landscaping;
            b.   A nonconforming structure is occupied by a conforming use that
requires additional landscaping;
            c.   Existing landscaping becomes nonconforming by the adoption of
this Zoning Ordinance; or
            d.   A conforming structure or use is expanded.
               (1)   Whenever a building or use is enlarged and does not have
adequate landscaping, and the enlargement is less than or equal to 50% by area,
the building or use shall meet the applicable landscaping requirements of
subsection 4.01 for the enlarged area only.
               (2)   Whenever a building or use is enlarged and does not have
adequate landscaping, and the enlargement is greater than 50% by area, the
entire building and site shall meet the applicable landscaping requirements of
subsection 4.01.
      G.   Restoration of nonconforming structures.
         1.   Total destruction. If a nonconforming structure is damaged or
destroyed and the damage is greater than 50% of its total appraised value
according to the most recent county appraisal prior to the damage occurring,
the nonconforming structure cannot be rebuilt except in conformance with the
Zoning Ordinance.
         2.   Partial destruction. If a nonconforming structure is damaged by
fire, explosion, rioting, or natural disaster, or catastrophic event and the
damage is 50% or less of its total appraised value according to the most recent
county appraisal prior to the damage occurring, the nonconforming structure may
be rebuilt to its previous condition, including dimensions and setbacks.
            a.   The construction must comply with all current building codes
and zoning regulations in effect at the time the structure received a building
permit for initial construction and for any subsequent changes, additions, or
expansions to the structure that occurred following the initial construction of
the structure.
            b.   Reconstruction must commence within 12 months of the date the
damage occurred (see subsection 3.07.G.3 below).
            c.   If the Zoning Administrator cannot determine the applicable
regulations, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a hearing and shall take
evidence such as previously adopted ordinances, photographs, and tax records to
determine the standards that apply to the reconstruction.
            d.   Any change to a dimension or a setback of the nonconforming
structure may be approved by a zoning variance.
         3.   Reconstruction of nonconforming structure with a nonconforming
use.
            a.   If the nonconforming structure contained a nonconforming use,
the Building Official may authorize the nonconforming use to continue during
reconstruction of the nonconforming structure, if the nonconforming use is
conducted according to all applicable city codes.
            b.   If the Building Official orders the nonconforming use to cease
during reconstruction of the nonconforming structure, the nonconforming use may
continue after a certificate of occupancy is granted for the reconstruction,
subject to d. below.
         4.   Failure to begin reconstruction. If the owner of a nonconforming
structure fails to begin reconstruction of the destroyed structure within 12
months of the date of destruction under the provisions of subsection 3.07.g.2,
the nonconforming structure and any nonconforming use that existed within the
structure is automatically discontinued and abandoned.
      H.   Movement of nonconforming structure. The property owner may relocate
a nonconforming structure within the same platted lot, if the relocated
structure complies with all other applicable requirements.
      I.   Abandonment of nonconforming uses.
         1.   A certificate of occupancy may be issued for the continuance of a
nonconforming use, or to a new owner or operator of the same use, so long as
the nonconforming use was legal at the time of the adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance and has not been abandoned as defined in this subsection 3.07.I.
         2.   A nonconforming use is considered abandoned when the
nonconforming use ceases for a period of six consecutive calendar months.
         3.   A use becomes abandoned six months after the occurrence of the
first of any of the following events:
            a.   On the date when the use of land is physically vacated;
            b.   On the date the use ceases to be actively involved in the sale
of merchandise or the provision of services;
            c.   On the date of termination of any lease or contract under
which the nonconforming use has occupied the land; or
            d.   On the date a final reading of water or power meters is made
by the applicable utility provider(s).
         4.   Once a nonconforming use, including a residential use has been
abandoned, the nonconforming use shall not be allowed to be reintroduced within
the applicable zoning district. This prohibition of the reoccupation or
reintroduction of an abandoned nonconforming use shall be enforced by the
denial of building permit or certificate of occupancy applications.
         5.   A nonconforming use, once abandoned, may continue if
reestablished in a similar building within six months.
         6.   Any nonconforming use that does not involve a permanent building
or structure that is moved from the premises shall be considered abandoned if a
similar building or structure is not reestablished within six months.
         7.   Unless the nonconforming use status is reinstated pursuant to
subsection 3.07.J Loss of and Reinstatement of Nonconforming Use Status, an
abandoned use shall not be instituted on that parcel or other parcel in any
district which does not permit the abandoned use.
      J.   Loss of and reinstatement of nonconforming use status.
         1.   Loss of nonconforming use status. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that a nonconforming use has met the definition of abandonment under
subsection 3.07.I.3 above, the use shall not be instituted on that parcel or
other parcel in any district that does not permit the discontinued use.
         2.   Application for nonconforming use status reinstatement.
            a.   The owner or operator of the abandoned nonconforming use may
submit a written application to the Board of Adjustment to have the
nonconforming rights reinstated.
            b.   Written application for reinstatement of nonconforming rights
must be made within 30 calendar days after the denial of building permit or
certificate of occupancy application for the nonconforming use.
         3.   Board of Adjustment hearing.
            a.   The Board of Adjustment shall hold a hearing on the requested
reinstatement of a nonconforming use status within 30 calendar days of the
request or the next scheduled Board of Adjustment meeting, whichever is sooner.
            b.   The Zoning Administrator will prepare a report with written
findings. The applicant and the Zoning Administrator are jointly responsible
for providing evidence in support of any findings to the Board of Adjustment.
            c.   Evidence in support of reinstatement may include invoices,
water, sewer, or electricity usage records, or photographs or receipts
demonstrating the owner's investment in maintaining the use. The failure of the
owner or operator to remove on premise signs may not be used as the sole
evidence of a continuing use.
            d.   The Board of Adjustment shall use the above abandonment
criteria in deliberating the case.
         4.   Board of Adjustment decision. After opening the public hearing
and receiving testimony from the applicant and any member of the public, the
Board of Adjustment may act to approve or deny reinstatement of the
nonconforming use.
         5.   Effect of approval.
            a.   Approval by the Board of Adjustment immediately reinstates the
nonconforming use status and allows the applicant to obtain a building permit
or certificate of occupancy if the Board of Adjustment finds that the applicant
has provided sufficient evidence that the use was not discontinued for longer
than six months.
            b.   Reinstatement of the nonconforming use status by the Board of
Adjustment expires if a building permit is not applied for within 90 days of
the Board action.
            c.   Denial by the Board of Adjustment is final.
      K.   Nonconformity created by acquisition of right-of-way.
         1.   Lawful conforming structure.
            a.   If a property is occupied by a lawful structure and the
acquisition of right-of-way by eminent domain proceedings, dedication, or
purchase by the city, county, state, or a federal agency creates a
nonconforming structure, lot, or setback, the structure remains a lawful
conforming structure to the extent the nonconformity results from the
acquisition of right-of-way.
            b.   If a structure described in subsection 3.07.K.1.a is damaged
or destroyed by natural causes the structure may be rebuilt.
         2.   When owner receives compensation for screening or landscaping.
            a.   If a property owner receives compensation for screening or
landscaping due to right-of-way acquisition, the owner must relocate fencing or
landscaping originally located on the acquired property in accordance with
subsection 4.01 and subsection 4.02.
            b.   If the property owner contends that the right-of-way
acquisition makes relocating the fencing or landscaping impractical due to
insufficient room on the property, the owner may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a waiver from the requirements of subsection 3.07.K.2.a or
propose to the Board that an alternative location be accepted.
         3.   When owner receives compensation for demolition.
            a.   The Building Official will not issue a certificate of
occupancy for a structure if the owner has received compensation for the
demolition of the structure or other curative measures until the structure
meets all applicable ordinances, or the curative measures for which the owner
received compensation have been completed.
            b.   For purposes of this subsection, CURATIVE MEASURES are those
actions, corrections, repairs or improvements identified in an appraisal or
similar valuation analysis prepared in the context of considering damages to
the remainder suffered as a result of the acquisition of a portion of property.
   3.08.   Accessory Buildings and Uses.

feet in height unless otherwise specified in this subsection 4.02 or unless
approved by a planned development or specific use permit.
            c.   In lieu of screening required in this subsection 4.02, the
Zoning Administrator may waive the requirement for screening between a
nonresidential use development and a SF or MF zoning district if any of the
following conditions are present:
               (1)   An existing natural or manmade screen effectively provides
the same level of screening as an opaque wall;
               (2)   The nonresidential and residential properties are

            a.   A masonry screening wall is required for all single-family
detached residential, duplex, and townhome developments where the rear yard of
two or more lots abuts a roadway with a classification of collector, arterial,
or freeway.
            b.   Each section of required screening wall described in
subsection a above must be six feet to eight feet in height and utilize a
horizontal offset of at least 18 inches every 100 to 200 linear feet to allow
for a meandering sidewalk and to avoid a monolithic appearance.
            c.   The wall must be placed within a maintenance easement or
separate lot sufficient to contain the wall footings and provide at least four
feet of access room on both sides.
         3.   Screening required between outside storage areas and other uses.
A masonry screening wall is required around the perimeter of all new outside
storage areas in accordance with subsection 3.04.B.19.b.
         4.   Responsibility for constructing the screening wall.
            a.   When a new nonresidential use development or outside storage
abuts the property line of an existing development and screening is required by
this subsection 4.02, the developer of the new construction is responsible for
erecting any required screening wall adjacent to the common property line with
the existing development.
            b.   When a residential use is constructed and screening is
required, the screening must be in place before any infrastructure is accepted
by the city or before the final plat is recorded with the county.
            c.   The screening wall must be constructed along the entire shared
portion of the common property line or right-of-way line, as applicable.
            d.   The design and construction material of the screening wall
must be as specified in subsection 4.02.C.6.
         5.   Screening walls for loading docks.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7837.png]
 
               (2)   The wall must screen the entire loading dock or space from
the residential use.
               (3)   Screening materials for walls attached to a building shall
utilize similar materials to the building's façades. Freestanding walls must
follow subsection 4.02.C.6.
         6.   Screening wall required materials and maintenance.
            a.   Any screening wall installed pursuant to this subsection 4.02
must be constructed of one or more of the following materials:
               (1)   Brick, stone, or split-face concrete masonry unit; or
               (2)   Pre-cast concrete wall or poured-in-place concrete wall or
split-face concrete masonry unit (CMU) with a similar appearance as brick or
natural stone.
            b.   All screening wall construction materials must match the
principal building on the same lot or be finished in coordinated earth-tones,
which may include red brick.
            c.   Screening walls attached to buildings must match the material,
pattern, and color of the building.
            d.   Natural or decorative variations in color or pattern are
permitted such as mottled brick or variations resulting from the use or
imitation of natural materials such as granite or limestone.
            e.   Screening walls abutting a residential use development,
whether utilized as screening between uses or screening from the right-of-way,
must be constructed with a continuous concrete footing with mow strip and
utilize a galvanized steel support hanger under each panel to prevent panel
failure or buckling.
            f.   Any wall that experiences subsidence, buckling, or other
damage resulting in the wall deflecting more than three degrees off of center
must be repaired or replaced by the owner of the property containing the wall
or the owner responsible for its construction.

within 500 feet of the nearest public entrance for each use.
               (6)   The agreement must be memorialized on an instrument filed
in Johnson County Records with a copy of the filed agreement provided to the
city before issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
         5.   Parking dimensions.
            a.   Parking spaces that allow for a vehicle to overhang a curb
must measure at least nine feet wide by 18 feet deep.
            b.   Curbs and wheel stops must be designed to allow no more than
18 inches of overhang onto sidewalks and landscape buffers and islands.
            c.   Required parking spaces in both commercial and residential
developments that do not allow for a vehicle to overhang a curb (such as spaces
that abut walls or fences, two spaces that face each other, or single-family
detached residential and duplex driveway parking spaces) must measure at least
nine feet wide by 20 feet deep.
            d.   Accessible parking spaces must meet Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) standards for accessible spaces (as amended).
            e.   Sidewalks and access aisles must maintain ADA required minimum
widths at all times, regardless of whether the sidewalk or access aisle is
adjacent to an accessible parking space.

         6.   Approved parking configurations are shown in Figure 20: Standard
Parking Configurations. The dimensions listed in Table 12: Minimum Dimensions
by Parking Configuration are the minimum required dimensions. Drive aisles that
function as fire lanes may require greater dimensions as determined by the Fire
Marshal.
      B.   Stacking spaces.
         1.   Purpose. Stacking spaces provide room for vehicles to queue
before receiving a service, such as services rendered by drive-thru or drive-in
uses.
         2.   Applicability.
            a.   Stacking spaces are required for all new uses listed in Table
13: Required Stacking Spaces by Use, including the conversion of an existing
building that does not require stacking space to one of the uses listed in
Table 13.
            b.   The Zoning Administrator may approve a reduction in stacking
spaces for a child care facility (day-care center) if the reduction will not
cause stacking in the public right-of-way.
         3.   General standards.
            a.   All required stacking spaces must be situated entirely outside
the right-of-way and any designated fire lane or driveway.
            b.   Stacking spaces must not overhang any sidewalk or pedestrian
path.
            c.   The minimum dimensions of a stacking space are nine feet by 18
feet with a vertical clearance of at least ten feet.

with impervious surface materials and shall be constructed with reinforced
concrete or asphalt.
               (2)   Areas used for emergency access, as fire lanes, or as
loading spaces must be capable of supporting 75,000 pounds or the minimum
specified in the city's adopted fire code.
            e.   Parking lot maintenance.
               (1)   Each owner of property developed as nonresidential use or
residential use, including property used as parking (principal use), is
responsible for maintaining the condition of all parking areas on the property,
regardless of whether the parking areas are accessible to the public.
               (2)   Maintenance includes repairing of potholes and pavement
failures, repairs to prevent ponding or standing water, sealing cracks and
joint failures, and removal of trash and weeds.
               (3)   Parking areas other than those used for single-family
detached residential and duplex must maintain contrasting striping marking the
boundaries of each parking space.
            f.   Parking for new and unlisted uses. The Zoning Administrator
will determine the parking rate that applies to any use not listed in the Use
Chart (see subsection 3.02 Classification of New and Unlisted Uses).
            g.   Relief from parking requirements. The City Council may approve
up to a 20% reduction in parking requirements if the Council finds that the
reduction will not cause or increase congestion in the public right-of-way or
negatively impact adjacent property owners.
      C.   Loading spaces.
         1.   Each loading space must be a minimum of ten feet wide by 25 feet
long and must have a vertical clearance of at least 14 feet.
         2.   Loading spaces are required according to Table 14: Required
Loading Spaces by Floor Area.
   Table 14: Required Loading Spaces by Floor Area
 
Building Floor Area           Required Loading Spaces

Over 10,000 to 50,000 sq. ft. 1
Over 50,000 sq. ft.           2 plus 1 space per additional 100,000 square feet
                              of floor area
 
         3.   Loading spaces may not be located within 20 feet of any property
zoned SF or MF.
         4.   No loading space shall be situated within a fire lane.
         5.   Nonconforming uses permitted to continue must provide off-street
loading spaces with access and maneuvering space adequate to prevent loading
and unloading within the street.
      D.   Maximum parking surface area in SF Districts.
         1.   Any property with a garage must have a paved driveway leading
from the street to the garage that is equivalent in width to the garage
openings. The driveway may be reduced in width to eight feet at the right-of-
way line.
         2.   The total paved area of a driveway providing access to a property
zoned SF may not consume more than 50% of the front yard.
         3.   In addition to driveway width required in subsection 4.03.D,
properties zoned SF are allowed one additional parking space measuring no more
than eight feet in width. The additional space must utilize the same surface as
the existing driveway.
         4.   The Zoning Administrator may approve a continuous circular
driveway if it meets the following conditions:
            a.   The driveway connects directly to a street in two locations,
and covers no more than 65% of the front yard; and
            b.   The width of the circular driveway does not exceed 50% of the
minimum front yard setback.
         5.   If a deed restriction or private covenant imposes different
standards for driveway layout or coverage than those established in this
subsection , the stricter standard is deemed controlling.
      E.   Heavy load vehicle parking.
         1.   Other than the parking of recreation vehicles on lots developed
as detached single-family use over 10,000 square feet (see subsection 4.03.F),
heavy load vehicles are prohibited from parking in any district zoned SF, MF,
MU, NC, LC, RC, or any PD with the same or similar underlying districts.
         2.   This restriction does not apply to heavy load vehicles that are
conducting a delivery of products or goods to a property zoned MU or C or
utilizing loadings spaces in accordance with subsection 4.03.C. Loading and
unloading is prohibited within the public right-of-way.
         3.   Heavy load vehicles are prohibited within SF and MF districts
except when used for moving or delivery of household items, such as moving
trucks and vans and appliance delivery.
      F.   RV parking in SF Districts.
         1.   Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to recognize that
recreational vehicles (RVs) are generally incompatible with the scale and use
of detached single-family residential properties and, if not properly screened
from view and maintained, have the potential to cause adverse impacts on
adjacent properties, including but not limited to the following:
            a.   By reducing the area that can be used for parking personal
automobiles and light trucks, thereby forcing those vehicles to encroach over
the sidewalk or park in the street;
            b.   By damaging ground surfaces and causing standing water during
rain events; and
            c.   By creating a visual nuisance that diminishes property values
when the RV is not properly stored, maintained, and protected from the
elements.
         2.   Conditions for parking or storing RVs in SF Districts. Parking or
storage of any RV, whether a trailer or self-propelled that qualifies as a
heavy load vehicle or exceeds 26 feet or 16,000 pounds gross vehicle weight
rating (GVWR) is prohibited in an SF District unless the RV is parked or stored
in conformance with this subsection 4.03.F.
            a.   The property on which the RV is stored must be a minimum of
10,000 square feet in size.
            b.   No more than one RV is allowed on a lot.
            c.   When not being prepared for use or storage, the RV must remain
parked on a concrete or asphalt pad capable of withstanding both the static and
live load of the RV.
            d.   The parking pad and the RV must be located according to the
following:
               (1)   At least 35 feet from the front right-of-way line or
behind the rearmost portion of the front-facing façade of the house;
               (2)   At least 20 feet from the side right-of-way line on a
corner lot;
               (3)   At least seven feet from any abutting side or rear lot
line shared with a property zoned SF;
               (4)   Trees and overhead powerlines must be maintained to avoid
touching the top of the RV.
            e.   Any carport or structure used to cover or enclose the RV must
maintain the same setbacks listed for a parking pad and may not exceed the
maximum height allowed for an accessory building.
            f.   A carport or structure used to cover or enclose an RV is
considered an accessory building for the purpose of calculating lot coverage
and maximum square footage of accessory buildings under subsection 3.08.
   4.04.   Lighting Standards.
      A.   Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to:
         1.   Reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed
outdoor lighting;

                  (c)   The meter shall be tested and calibrated by an
independent commercial photometric laboratory or manufacturer within one year
of date of use as attested to by a certificate issued by such laboratory.
               (2)   Horizontal method of measurement.
                  (a)   The meter sensor shall be mounted not more than six
inches above ground level in a horizontal position.
                  (b)   Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been
exposed to provide a constant reading.
                  (c)   Measurements shall be made when the meteorological
optical range is six miles or further so that measurements will not be
adversely affected by atmospheric scatter.
                  (d)   Measurements shall be made after dark with the existing
questioned light sources on, then with the same sources off.
                  (e)   This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and
other ambient light.
                  (f)   The difference between the two readings shall be
compared to the foot-candle ratings listed in subsection 4.04.C.10.
               (3)   Vertical method of measurement.
                  (a)   The meter sensor shall be mounted at five feet above
ground level in a vertical position, perpendicular to the property line and
facing the outdoor lighting in question.
                  (b)   Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been
exposed to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be made after dark
with the existing questioned light sources on, then with the same sources off.
                  (c)   This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and
other ambient light.
                  (d)   The difference between the two readings shall be
compared to the foot-candle ratings listed in subsection 4.04.C.10.
      D.   Exemptions. The following are exempt from the standards contained in

the property line may exceed the maximum shown in Table 15 if the luminaire
meets one or both of the following:
               (1)   Individual lamps have a luminosity of less than 300
lumens; or
               (2)   A cutoff component is incorporated into the design of the
luminaire that prevents the bulb from being viewed from the property line or
the right-of-way.
            b.   Security lighting or floodlighting. The maximum lighting level
at the property line may exceed the maximum shown in Table 15 if the luminaire
meets all of the following:
               (1)   The lamp is automatically activated and deactivated by a
motion sensor;
               (2)   The lamp is not on for a continuous period of more than
ten minutes before automatically deactivating; and

            a.   The purpose of the AP, Airport Overlay District is to ensure
development near the airport is compatible with airport operations, that land
uses surrounding the airport are developed according to the recommendations of
the Airport Master Plan, to limit the adverse impacts of airport operations on
adjacent properties by accounting for those impacts in the development and use
of property near the airport, and to protect the airport from incompatible
encroachments.
            b.   The AP, Airport Overlay is applicable to each property within
the district in addition to the regulations of the base district classification
in which such property is located. If regulations are found to be in conflict,
the most restrictive regulation will govern if it does not conflict with the
intent and purpose of the AP, Airport Overlay.
            c.   For the purposes of regulating building height, construction
in the AP, Airport Overlay is regulated within nine zones indicated in
subsection 4.06.F.3.
            d.   For the purposes of regulating noise reduction for certain
land uses, the AP, Airport Overlay is divided into three zones indicated in
subsection 4.06.F.4. The zoning classification of each property is designated
by the base district classification plus the AP, Airport Overlay designation.
For example, a property in a CI, Commercial/Industrial Flex District within the
AP district will carry a CI (AP-1, 2, or 3) designation.
            e.   Within the AP district, the regulations of each respective
base district shall continue to apply to property located in that district,
except as supplemented or modified in this subsection 4.06.F.

         4.   Airport noise zones.
            a.   Airport noise zones are established within the Controlled
Compatible Land Use Area for the purpose of regulating the development of noise
sensitive land uses, to promote compatibility between the airport and
surrounding land uses, and to protect the airport from incompatible
encroachments.
            b.   Zones. The boundaries of the airport noise zones correspond to
the Ldn noise contours shown on the most recently-adopted noise exposure map
for the airport and are identified as follows:
               (1)   Airport Overlay-1 (AP-1) is that area within the
Controlled Compatible Land Use Area with a noise contour that is between 65 Ldn
(Yearly Day-Night Average Sound Level) and 70 Ldn (Yearly Day-Night Average
Sound Level).
               (2)   Airport Overlay-2 (AP-2) is that area within the
Controlled Compatible Land Use Area with a noise contour that is between 70 Ldn
(Yearly Day-Night Average Sound Level) and 75 Ldn (Yearly Day-Night Average
Sound Level).
               (3)   Airport Overlay-3 (AP-3) is that area within the
Controlled Compatible Land Use Area beyond the 75 Ldn (Yearly Day-Night Average
Sound Level) noise contour.
            c.   Compatible uses permitted within the airport noise zones are
shown in Table 19: Compatible Land Uses.
         5.   Compatible Land Uses Table. Below is how to use the table.
            a.   A cell with a "Y" indicates that the land use and related
structures are compatible without restrictions.
            b.   A cell with an "N" indicates that the land use and related
structures are not compatible and are prohibited.
            c.   A cell with a number ("25" or "30") indicates that measures to
achieve Noise Level Reduction (NLR) from outdoor to indoor must be incorporated
into the design and construction of the entire structure.
            d.   Where "N" is indicated for a residential use followed by "25"
or "30", it means that residential use is not compatible but if the property is
zoned for residential, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor Noise Level
Reduction (NLR) of at least 25 dB or 30 dB must be achieved, as indicated.
Normal single-family construction can be expected to provide a Noise Level
Reduction of 20 dB, meaning that Noise Level Reduction measures in this area
require a reduction of 5 to 10 dB over standard construction and generally
assume mechanical ventilation and closed windows year-round. However, the use
of NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems.
            e.   Where "Y" is indicated for a use followed by a "25", it means
that the use is compatible where measures to achieve a Noise Level Reduction of
25 dB are incorporated into the design and construction of portions of
buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or
where the normal noise level is low.
            f.   Where "Y" is indicated for a use followed by a "30", it means
that the use is compatible where measures to achieve Noise Level Reduction of
30 dB are incorporated into the design and construction of portions of
buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or
where the normal noise level is low.
            g.   Where ("R25") is indicated, only the use listed is compatible.
Any residential buildings associated with the use require a Noise Level
Reduction of 25 dB to be compatible.
            h.   Where ("R30") is indicated, only the use listed is compatible.
Any residential buildings associated with the use require a Noise Level
Reduction of 30 dB to be compatible.

         6.   Interference with airport operations. No use within the AP,
Airport Overlay shall be conducted in such a way that creates any of the
following effects:
            a.   Creation of electrical interference with navigational signals

            b.   Utilizing lighting in a way that creates difficulty in
distinguishing between airport lights and lights employed by the use within the
AP, Airport Overlay;
            c.   Creation of glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport or
impairing visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
            d.   Creation of bird strike hazards; or
            e.   Otherwise endangering or interfering with the safe landing,
taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
         7.   Existing buildings and lots within the AP, Airport Overlay.
            a.   Regulations not retroactive.
               (1)   The regulations prescribed by this division shall not be
construed to require changes in land use or the removal or other change or
alteration of any structure not conforming to the regulations as of the
effective date of this division or otherwise interfere with the continuance of
any nonconforming use.
               (2)   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this subsection
and whose completion is diligently pursued.
               (3)   For purposes of this division, permitted nonconforming

            b.   Exceptions for residential uses.
               (1)   Existing residences. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this subsection, all residential uses located within the airport noise zones

be repaired and enlarged provided the number of dwelling units is not
increased.
               (2)   Vacant lots. Vacant platted lots which are zoned for
single-family residential uses may be used for single-family residences
providing they conform to all other applicable requirements of this division.
Such lots may not be subdivided into more than one additional lot for single-
family residential use.
               (3)   New residences. New residential structures within the AP-
1 district must achieve an outdoor to indoor noise level reduction of at least

§ 155.5 ZONING APPLICATION SUBMITTAL AND PROCESSING PROCEDURES.
   5.01.   General Application Processing.
      A.   Purpose and applicability.
         1.   To promote efficiency in processing applications for development,
the city may from time to time create standardized development application
forms and a consolidated list of required documents and information that must
be provided prior to development approval.
         2.   Any applicant seeking approval of an application governed by this
Section 155.5 must submit a complete application and comply with all
requirements of this subsection.
      B.   Pre-application meeting. All applicants must attend an informal and
nonbinding pre-application meeting prior to submitting an application, unless
the requirement to attend a pre-application meeting is waived by the Zoning
Administrator.
      C.   Application materials.
         1.   The city will furnish a standardized application form pertaining
to each application type listed in this subsection.
         2.   The city will include with the application form a complete list
of submittal requirements for the application to be considered complete. The
list may include, but may not be limited to, the following submittal
requirements:
            a.   List of persons, such as the property owner, an agent, or
other entity who are required to sign or acknowledge the application;
            b.   Documents that constitute proof of ownership;
            c.   Property description and legal boundaries;
            d.   Requirements for plan scale and level of plan detail;
            e.   Information regarding property outside the boundaries of the
subject property; and
            f.   Number and type of supporting technical documents and plans
including:
               (1)   Legal surveys;
               (2)   Line drawings;
               (3)   Schematics;
               (4)   Architectural elevations;
               (5)   Topographical surveys;
               (6)   Hydrologic studies; and
               (7)   Other information directly related to determining whether
the application complies with the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
         3.   The city may set fees associated with each application in a
published fee schedule for the purpose of recovering costs related to reviewing
the application except for Board of Zoning Adjustment Appeal (see subsection
6.01 below) which shall be $400.
         4.   The city may require a property owner who uses an agent, such as
an engineer, architect, land planner, surveyor, or real estate professional, to
submit an application to provide written and signed or acknowledged
authorization for the agent to submit the application on the property owner's
behalf.
      D.   Payment of indebtedness.
         1.   The applicant is responsible for providing proof that no
delinquent taxes or fees are associated with property that is the subject of an
application.
         2.   At any point in the application process, the Zoning Administrator
may require that the applicant submit necessary documentation or proof that no
taxes or fees are delinquent or outstanding on property that is the subject of
an application. The Zoning Administrator may choose to accept an application
without such documentation or proof if the applicant agrees to provide
documentation or proof that no taxes or fees are owed prior to approval of the
application.
      E.   Application determination of completeness.
         1.   No application shall be deemed complete and accepted for
processing unless it is accompanied by all documents required by and prepared
in accordance with the requirements of this subsection 5.01.
         2.   For a determination of completeness to be issued, an application
must include the following:
            a.   A completed application form;
            b.   Every item, study, and document required by this subsection
5.01 for the type of application being submitted, or required for the plan for
development;
            c.   Applicable fee(s), as specified in the fee schedule or any
applicable ordinance; and
            d.   Evidence that the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and
other ordinances of the city are satisfied.
         3.   A determination of completeness shall not constitute a
determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of this
subsection 5.01.
         4.   Not later than the tenth business day after the date an
application is submitted, the Zoning Administrator shall make a written
determination whether the application constitutes a complete application.
            a.   The written determination shall include a determination of
whether all information and documents required by this subsection 5.01 have
been submitted.
            b.   The determination shall be provided to the applicant within
such time period by electronic mail, United States Certified Mail, or regular
mail at the address listed on the application, or by personal delivery to the
applicant or the applicant's agent.
            c.   A determination that an application is incomplete shall
specify the documents or other information needed to complete the application
and shall state that the application will expire if the documents or other
information is not submitted within 45 calendar days after the date the
application was submitted.
         5.   An application filed on or after the effective date of this
subsection 5.01 shall be deemed complete on the 11th business day after the
application has been received, if the applicant has not otherwise been notified
that the application is incomplete.
         6.   For purposes of this section, the applicant shall be deemed to
have been notified if the city has mailed or delivered a copy of the
determination as provided in subsection 5.01.E.4.
         7.   The processing of an application by any city employee prior to
the time the application is determined to be complete shall not be binding on
the city as the official date of acceptance of the application for filing. The
date of filing shall be the date the Zoning Administrator determines that the
application meets the requirements of this subsection 5.01.
         8.   The incompleteness of the application shall be grounds for denial
regardless of whether a determination of incompleteness was provided to the
applicant.
         9.   A development application shall expire on the 45th calendar day
after the application is submitted to the Zoning Administrator for processing
if the applicant fails to provide documents or other information necessary to
meet the requirements of this subsection 5.01 as specified in the determination
provided to the applicant. Upon expiration, the application will be returned to
the applicant together with any accompanying documents. Thereafter, a new
application for approval of the development application must be submitted. The
Zoning Administrator may approve an extension of up to 30 days at the written
request of the applicant.
         10.   No vested rights accrue solely from the filing of an application
that has expired pursuant to this subsection 5.01, or from the filing of a
complete or incomplete application that is subsequently denied.
      F.   Action by Zoning Administrator.
         1.   The date that the applicant furnishes a signed application to the
Zoning Administrator or designee is considered the official date that
application was received. The Zoning Administrator will process the
application, including any required submittal dates and applicable requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance in a manner consistent with Tex. Local Gov’t Code
Chapter 245.
         2.   Once the Zoning Administrator accepts the application as a
complete application, the Zoning Administrator or a designee will coordinate
review of the submitted materials for conformance with the requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance.
         3.   Following review of the application by all applicable
departments, the Zoning Administrator or a designee will respond in writing to
the applicant with a coordinated set of comments that list and describe any
deficiencies the applicant must address in order for the application to be
considered.
         4.   If approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council
is required for an application to be approved, the Zoning Administrator will
schedule the application on the next available agenda of the applicable body
once all comments and deficiencies (see subsection 5.01.f.3) are addressed or
as consistent with state law.
   5.02.   Dormant Projects and Vested Rights Petition.
      A.   Dormant projects.
         1.   This subsection 5.02 is adopted under Tex. Local Gov’t Code
Chapter 245 to provide expiration dates for permits that lack an expiration
date under applicable regulations. This subsection does not apply to a permit
that is subject to an expiration date under the regulations applicable to the
permit. For purposes of this subsection, a permit that is not subject to an
expiration date is an "unexpired permit."
         2.   If an unexpired permit was approved prior to the effective date
of this Zoning Ordinance, it shall expire five years after the date of its
approval, unless the applicant submits evidence sufficient to show that
progress towards completion of the project was made prior to expiration.
         3.   For purposes of this subsection, progress towards completion of a
project includes any one of the following:
            a.   An application for a final plat or plan has been submitted and
deemed complete;
            b.   A good-faith attempt has been made to file with the city or
other regulatory agency an application for a permit necessary to begin or
continue towards completion of the project;
            c.   Costs have been incurred for developing the project including,
without limitation, costs associated with roadway, utility, and other
infrastructure facilities designed to serve, in whole or in part, the project
(but exclusive of land acquisition) in the aggregate amount of 5% of the most
recent appraised market value of the real property on which the project is
located;
            d.   Fiscal security has been posted with the city or other
regulatory agency to ensure performance of an obligation required by that
regulatory agency; or
            e.   Utility connection fees or impact fees for the project have
been paid and account is in good standing.
         4.   If the first permit in a series of permits for a project expires
based on dormancy of the project, then that permit cannot form the basis of a
vested rights petition.
      B.   Vested rights.
         1.   Purpose and applicability.
            a.   This subsection 5.02 establishes requirements for determining
whether a project is entitled to vested rights under Tex. Local Gov’t Code
Chapter 245 or § 43.002. To the extent a project is entitled to vested rights,
as determined under this subsection, a permit necessary to initiate, continue,
or complete the project may be exempt from some requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance.
            b.   The purpose of this subsection 5.02 is to:
               (1)   Establish a clear and consistent process for evaluating
vested rights claims;
               (2)   Ensure that vested rights determinations are based on
accurate and complete information, including the nature and scope of the
original project for which vested rights are asserted, as well as any actual
development that has occurred over time; and
               (3)   Recognize legitimate claims of vested rights under state
law, while ensuring that new development complies to the greatest extent
possible with current regulations.
         2.   Vested rights petition required.
            a.   A petition for vested rights shall be submitted by a landowner
or a landowner's agent in order to request that an application for a permit be
reviewed under ordinances, regulations, or rules other than those in effect on
the date the application is filed.
            b.   The petition shall conform to the requirements of subsection
5.02.B.3.
         3.   Contents of vested rights petition. A petition for vested rights
shall be submitted in a form approved by the Zoning Administrator and must
include, at a minimum, the following information:
            a.   A permit application for development of the property, which
must be submitted concurrent with the vested rights petition;
            b.   A conceptual development plan for the property, including the
scope and intensity of development, as well as the nature of the land use.
Construction-level detail shall not be required;
            c.   A summary of the basis on which the applicant claims vested
rights;
            d.   The date on which the applicant claims that vested rights
accrued;
            e.   Any permit or fair notice application that was submitted on
the claimed date; and
            f.   A complete chronological history of the project for which
vested rights are claimed, including:
               (1)   A list of permits for development of the property, along
with supporting documents, that were issued or applied for after the date the
application claims that vested rights accrued;
               (2)   A description of any permitted or unpermitted development
that occurred on the property after the date the application claims that vested
rights accrued;
               (3)   A description of existing development on the property,
regardless of whether the development is permitted or unpermitted;
               (4)   A list of all annexations and zoning changes affecting the
property, if any;
               (5)   Any covenants, conditions, or restrictions recorded in the
deed records for the property; and
               (6)   Evidence of progress towards completion of the project
(see subsection 5.02.A.3).
         4.   Completeness review for vested rights petition. A vested rights
petition and associated permit are treated as a single application for purposes
of completeness review and expiration.
         5.   Vested rights determination.
            a.   Not later than ten business days after acceptance of a
complete vested rights petition, the Zoning Administrator shall review the
petition under subsection 5.02.B.6 and render a determination consistent with
the requirements of this subsection 5.02.
            b.   In acting on a petition, the Zoning Administrator may:
               (1)   Approve the petition and require the development
applications necessary to initiate, continue, or complete the project to be
reviewed in accordance with regulations in effect on the vesting date, except
for those regulations exempt from vesting under state law;
               (2)   Deny the petition and require the development application
associated with the project to be reviewed under current regulations of this
Zoning Ordinance; or
               (3)   Approve the petition in part, according to the provisions
of this subsection 5.02.
            c.   The Zoning Administrator may approve a petition in part if a
project is entitled to some, but not all, of the rights asserted in the
petition.
            d.   A vested rights determination may not waive or modify
applicable regulations or provide relief not required by Tex. Local Gov’t Code
Chapter 245 or § 43.002.
            e.   The Zoning Administrator shall provide a written determination
to the applicant, which must state:
               (1)   Whether the petition is approved or denied, in whole or in
part, and the basis for the decision;
               (2)   Findings of fact in support of the decision and
information sufficient to identify the permit or fair notice application on
which the petition is based; and
               (3)   If the petition is approved:
                  (a)   A description of the project for which vested rights
are recognized; and
                  (b)   A vesting date.
         6.   Criteria for approval. A vested rights determination under this
subsection does not affect the availability of a variance or other
administrative remedy authorized in Section 155.6 Zoning Relief Procedures.
            a.   Chapter 245 petition.
               (1)   General standard. A permit application is entitled to
development rights under Tex. Local Gov’t Code Chapter 245 if the permit is
required to initiate, continue, or complete a project for which a prior
application was submitted to the city. An application is not entitled to
development rights if it is unrelated to or inconsistent with the original
project, or if the original project has been completed, changed, or expired.
               (2)   Review criteria. In determining whether a petition meets
the standard for approval under this subsection, the Zoning Administrator shall
consider the following factors:
                  (a)   The nature and extent of proposed development shown on
the prior permit or other application that initiated the project for which
vested rights are claimed;
                  (b)   Whether the permit application submitted in connection
with the vested rights petition is related to and consistent with the original
project;
                  (c)   The nature and extent of prior development of the
property, including any permitting or construction activity that occurred
subsequent to the vesting date requested by the applicant;
                  (d)   Any prior vested rights determinations made for
development of the property; and
                  (e)   Whether the project has become dormant in accordance
with the provisions of this subsection 5.02.
               (3)   The criteria in this subsection 5.02.B.6.a are intended to
assist the Zoning Administrator in reviewing Tex. Local Gov’t Code Chapter 245
petitions, but do not limit the Zoning Administrator from considering other
factors relevant to the determination of rights for a particular project.
            b.   Continuing use petition.
               (1)   General standard. A permit application is entitled to use
rights under Tex. Local Gov’t Code § 43.002 to the extent that current
regulations would prohibit:
                  (a)   Continued use of the land in the manner in which it was
being used on the date that annexation proceedings were instituted, if the use
was legal at that time; or
                  (b)   Beginning to use land in the manner that was planned
before the 90th day before the effective date of the annexation if:
                     (i)   One or more licenses, certificates, permits,
approvals, or other forms of authorization by a governmental entity were
required by law for the planned land use; and
                     (ii)   A completed application for the initial
authorization was filed with the governmental entity before the date the
annexation proceedings were instituted.
               (2)   Review criteria.
                  (a)   In determining whether a petition meets the standard
for approval under this subsection , the Zoning Administrator shall consider
the nature and extent of development that:
                     (i)   Occurred on the property prior to initiation of
annexation proceedings, including photographs or other evidence substantiating
the use; or
                     (ii)   Was proposed in one or more required applications
that have been approved by a governmental entity.
                  (b)   The criteria in subsection 5.02.B.6.b are intended to
assist the Zoning Administrator in reviewing continuing use petitions, but do
not limit the Zoning Administrator from considering other factors relevant to
the determination of rights for a particular project.
         7.   Effect of vested rights determination. If the Zoning
Administrator approves a vested rights petition, any permit required to
initiate, continue, or complete the project shall be entitled to the
development or continuing use rights recognized by the vested rights
determination, unless the project becomes dormant under this subsection 5.02 or
other applicable regulations.
         8.   Administrative guidelines.
            a.   The Zoning Administrator may adopt guidelines to assist in
reviewing applications.
            b.   Guidelines adopted under this subsection 6.b for review of
vested rights petitions may be used to help address common questions that arise
in determining vested rights, including but not limited to:
               (1)   Whether a permit application is required to continue,
complete, or initiate the project for which vested rights are claimed;
               (2)   Whether the project for which vested rights are claimed
has been completed, changed, or expired; and
               (3)   Whether progress towards completion of a project has been
made under subsection 5.02.A.3.
               (4)   Guidelines adopted under this subsection 5.02.B.8.b shall
be posted on the city's website and made available to the public, but need not
be adopted by administrative rule.
         9.   Appeal of vested rights determination.
            (1)   Right to appeal. An applicant may appeal the Zoning
Administrator's decision on the application for vested rights determination to
the City Council. An appeal under this subsection 9 stays acceptance by filing
of any related development applications.
            (2)   Process. The application for appeal shall be made in writing
to the City Secretary and shall state the basis for requesting the appeal. The
appeal shall be made within ten business days of the date of the letter. The
City Secretary shall schedule a hearing before the City Council within 30
calendar days of the date the appeal is submitted.
            (3)   Appeal of Council decision. A person dissatisfied with the
decision of the City Council may appeal the decision to a court within Johnson
County. The person shall file the appeal with the court within 30 days of the
decision of the City Council. If no appeal is filed, the decision of the
Council shall be final.
   5.03.   Alternative Compliance.
      A.   Purpose and applicability.
         1.   Purpose.
            a.   This subsection 5.03 establishes a provision for alternative
compliance associated with the review and approval of a development, including
improvements to existing structures or site features, as required in subsection
5.03.A.2.
            b.   The purpose of the alternative compliance process is to ensure
that:
               (1)   A proposed development complies with the purpose and
intent of this Zoning Ordinance as stated in subsection 1.02;
               (2)   A proposed project meets requirements that are appropriate
for lots or sites and site-specific development challenges by applying a
flexible approval procedure. A development may be interpreted under this
subsection 5.03 to include redevelopment of lots or sites with existing
improvements and encumbrances that may pose unique challenges to complying with
the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance; and
               (3)   To allow for different standards that are in agreement
with the city's comprehensive plan and that produce a substantially equivalent
effect as the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
         2.   Applicability.
            a.   A request for alternative compliance, as specifically cited
within this Zoning Ordinance, may be submitted for review and approval along
with the site plan for a project, or along with the project's initial
development application (as applicable for the project).
            b.   Alternative compliance requests must be clearly delineated
graphically or in narrative format, as appropriate, on the site plan (or on the
project's initial development application), including a reference to the
specific section within this Zoning Ordinance that allows consideration of an
alternative standard (see Table 20: Approval for Alternative Compliance).
            c.   The applicable zoning district standards for a project shall
not be reduced or varied using the alternative compliance process unless the
standard is specifically cited as qualifying for alternative compliance in this
Zoning Ordinance.
            d.   Review and approval. Using the criteria listed in subsection
5.03.B, the Zoning Administrator will decide a request for alternative
compliance submitted for the following:
    Table 20: Approval for Alternative Compliance
 
Subsection Number Subsection Title
3.05              Location and arrangement of buildings
4.01.C            General landscaping requirements

                  elements
4.06.B.7          Alternative compliance for design standards
 
      B.   Alternative compliance evaluation criteria.
         1.   The requested alternative compliance standard is consistent with
the recommendations and policies of the city's comprehensive plan.
         2.   The proposed alternative standard does not reduce a standard
unless it is, to the greatest extent practical, equally mitigated or improved
by increasing the standards of other requirements.
         3.   The proposed standard does not attempt to modify the land uses
allowed in the zoning district in which the subject property is located, or to
add a land use not normally allowed in the zoning district.
      C.   Alternative compliance appeal.
         1.   The applicant may appeal the Zoning Administrator's decision
within 30 calendar days of the Zoning Administrator providing a written
decision to the applicant.
         2.   The appeal will be placed on the next available agenda of the
City Council. The City Council may either affirm, reverse, or modify the Zoning
Administrator's decision.

and
               (4)   Any nonresidential use.
            b.   Site plans related to building permit applications. No
building permit shall be issued for any applicable developments or any
construction or development activity shall occur unless a site plan is first

unless a site plan is prepared in conjunction with a specific use permit (SUP)
application.
         3.   Effect of approval.
            a.   No building permit or certificate of occupancy will be issued
unless all construction and development conforms to the site plan as approved
by the city.
               (1)   While the site plan remains valid (see subsection
5.07.B.3.b), the city shall not apply any additional requirements concerning
building placement, streets, drives, parking, landscaping or screening.
               (2)   Except where authorized by ordinance, a site plan may not
be used to approve a variance to development regulations.
               (3)   Where an approved plan conflicts with an adopted
regulation and no zoning variance or zoning special exception is expressly
approved, the regulation shall apply.
            b.   Site plan lapse.
               (1)   The approval of a site plan is effective for a period of
two years from the date of approval (see subsection 5.01.F).
               (2)   Expired site plans.
                  (a)   Upon expiration of a site plan, the applicant must
submit a new site plan subject to the then existing regulations.

application for a site plan consistent with subsection 5.01 above, including
the following specific procedures:
         1.   Upon receiving a completed application for a site plan (see
subsection 5.01.E Application Determination of Completeness), the Zoning
Administrator will distribute the site plan to the relevant city departments
and officials (as well as outside agencies, as appropriate); and
         2.   The Zoning Administrator will:
            a.   Approve the application for a site plan;
            b.   Consolidate all comments received into a single itemized list
and return the comments to the applicant with instructions for revising the
site plan; or

               (7)   The Zoning Administrator may require that the applicant
prepare a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) report in order to assist the city in
determining whether the PD will be supported with adequate levels of roadways
and intersections concurrent with the demand created by the PD, and provide
recommendations for addressing any roadways that are currently inadequate to
support the impacts of the PD.
            c.   PD concept plan.
               (1)   The PD concept plan is a graphic representation of the
development plan for the PD.

more actions listed in subsection 5.02.A.3, the PD design statement and PD
concept plan will expire.
         2.   The property will remain zoned as PD on the Official Zoning
District Map, but the PD design statement and PD concept plan will no longer be
valid.
         3.   If the PD expires, a new PD design statement and PD concept plan
must be submitted and approved by City Council prior to approval of any plat or
site plan on the property.
         4.   The Zoning Administrator may grant a two year extension of
validity for the PD design statement and PD concept plan. At the end of the two
year extension, a second extension may be granted by the Zoning Administrator
for up to one year.
         5.   An extension shall be granted if a development application for
the PD has been submitted and is undergoing the development review process or
if the Zoning Administrator determines that the project has demonstrated
progress towards completion consistent with or more actions listed in
subsection 5.02.A.3.
      C.   PD modifications.
         1.   Minor PD amendment and adjustment. The City Manager's designee

            a.   Upon receiving a request to modify an approved PD, the City
Manager's designee will determine if proposed amendments to an approved PD
satisfy the above criteria listed in subsection 5.08.C.1.
            b.   If the City Manager's designee determines that the criteria
listed in subsection 5.08.C.1 are not satisfied, an application for an amended
PD shall be submitted for full review and approval according to the procedures
set forth in this subsection 5.08.
   5.09.   Specific Use Permit (SUP).
      A.   General description and authorization.
         1.   The uses listed under the various districts as "S" in the Use
Chart require approval of a specific use permit (SUP) prior to approval of a
certificate of occupancy.
         2.   With consideration given to setting, physical features,
compatibility with surrounding land uses, traffic, and aesthetics, the City
Council may authorize an SUP for a use indicated by "S" in the Use Chart if the
Council finds that the use as approved is compatible with existing or planned
land uses.
      B.   Application. Application and public hearing procedures for an SUP
are consistent with the following subsections:
         1.   Subsection 5.01 General Application Processing;
         2.   Subsection 5.04 Public Hearings and Notification Requirements for
Zoning-Related Applications;
         3.   Subsection 5.05 Zoning Text and Map Amendments;
         4.   Subsection 5.07 Site Plan Requirements, unless waived by the
Zoning Administrator.
      C.   Criteria for specific permit approval.
         1.   Specific use permit criteria. The City Council shall use the
following criteria to evaluate an SUP:
            a.   Whether the proposed use shall be in harmony with the policies
of the comprehensive plan.
            b.   Whether the proposed use shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district regulations.
            c.   Whether the proposed use shall not adversely affect the use of
neighboring properties.
            d.   Whether the proposed use shall not generate pedestrian and
vehicular traffic that is hazardous or in conflict with the existing and
anticipated traffic in the neighborhood.
            e.   Whether utility, drainage, parking, loading, signs, lighting
access and other necessary public facilities to serve the proposed use shall
meet the adopted codes of the city.
         2.   Specific conditions. In granting an SUP, the City Council may
impose conditions, including limits of time, which shall be complied with by
the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the
Building Official for use of the building on such property pursuant to such
SUP; and such conditions may not be construed as conditions precedent to the
granting of the certificate of occupancy.
         3.   Compliance with written requirements. No SUP shall be granted
unless the applicant, owner and grantee of the SUP accepts and agrees to be
bound by and comply with the written requirements of the SUP and any conditions
and supporting materials approved and adopted by City Council, including, but
not limited to, the site plan and other conditions and restrictions approved by
the City Council.
         4.   Expiration of SUP.
            a.   Following approval, an SUP may continue in operation and be
transferred between owners, operators, or businesses at the same location
unless one or more of the conditions listed in subsection 5.09.C.4.b is
present.
            b.   An SUP will expire under one or more of the following
conditions:
               (1)   The applicant does not apply for a building permit within
one year from the time the SUP is approved;
               (2)   The building, premise, or use associated with the SUP is
voluntarily vacated or abandoned for a period of six months or longer;
               (3)   The building, premise, or use associated with the SUP is
destroyed to an extent that is 50% or less of the most recent appraised value
by fire or other cause, and the building, premise, or use is not reconstructed
or reestablished within one year of the occurrence of the event that destroyed
the building, premise, or use; or
               (4)   The building, premise, or use associated with the SUP is
destroyed to an extent greater than 50% of the most recent appraised value by
fire or other cause.
            c.   The City Council, upon recommendation of the Planning and
Zoning Commission, may approve a request to delay expiration of an SUP by up to
one year.
            d.   If the SUP expires under any scenario listed in subsection
5.09.C.4.b, a new SUP must be approved prior to a certificate of occupancy
being issued on the property.
         5.   Modification of SUP.
            a.   No building, premise, or use associated with the SUP may be
enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise significantly changed
unless City Council approves a modification to the SUP according to the
procedures listed in subsection 5.09.B.
            b.   Any person possessing an SUP that is found to be in violation
of this Zoning Ordinance, another ordinance of the city, or the conditions
associated with the SUP must, upon notification by the city, cease the
violation within 30 days or modify the SUP consistent with this subsection
5.09.
            c.   If a violation does not cease following notice given by the
city, the City Council is authorized, by a simple majority vote, to suspend or
revoke the SUP.
         6.   The Board of Adjustment shall not have jurisdiction to hear,
review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect
to the granting extension, revocation, or modification or any other action
taken relating to such SUP.
   5.10.   Amortization of Nonconforming Uses.
      A.   City Council initiation of amortization case. The City Council, by
majority vote, may request that the Board of Adjustment consider establishing a
compliance date for a nonconforming use.
      B.   Board of Adjustment decision.
         1.   Once requested by the City Council, the Board of Adjustment may
require the discontinuance of a nonconforming use under any plan whereby the
full value of the use's structure and facilities can be amortized within a
definite period of time, taking into consideration the general character of the
neighborhood and the necessity for all property to conform to the zoning
regulations.
         2.   The value of any structures and facilities that are configured
for use by a conforming use in the zoning district where the property is
located may be excluded from the determination of a reasonable amortization
period.
         3.   All actions to discontinue a nonconforming use shall be taken
with due regard for the property rights of the persons affected when considered
in the light of the public welfare, the character of the area surrounding the
nonconforming use, and the goal of conservation and preservation of conforming
properties.
      C.   Public hearing process.
         1.   The Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing to determine
whether continued operation of the nonconforming use is in the public interest.
Any interested party may submit testimony or evidence either for or against
amortization.
         2.   Upon receiving a request from the City Council, the Zoning
Administrator shall schedule a public hearing before the Board of Adjustment.
         3.   In determining whether the continued operation is in the public
interest, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the following factors:
            a.   The character of the surrounding neighborhood;
            b.   The degree of incompatibility of the use with the zoning
district in which it is located;
            c.   The manner in which the use is being conducted;
            d.   The hours of operation of the use;
            e.   The extent to which continued operation of the use may
threaten public health or safety;
            f.   The environmental impacts of the use's operation, including
but not limited to the impacts of noise, glare, dust, and odor;
            g.   The extent to which public disturbances and nuisances may be
created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use;
            h.   The extent to which traffic or parking problems may be created
or perpetuated by continued operation of the use;
            i.   Any other factors relevant to the issue of whether continued
operation of the use will adversely affect nearby properties;
            j.   The extent the nonconforming use impacts the value and
marketability of the abutting and surrounding properties or neighborhood;
            k.   Whether the property is readily suitable for development or
operation of a conforming use.
         4.   If the Board of Adjustment determines that cessation of the
nonconforming use is in the public interest, the Board of Adjustment shall,
consistent with state law, provide a compliance date for the nonconforming use
under a plan whereby the owner's actual investment in the use before the time
that the use became nonconforming can be amortized within a reasonable time
period. The following factors shall be considered by the Board of Adjustment in
determining a reasonable amortization period:
            a.   The owner's capital investment in structures, fixed equipment,
and other assets (excluding inventory and other assets that may be feasibly
transferred to another site and excluding structures, fixed equipment, and
other assets that are readily suitable for use by a conforming use) on the
property before the time the use became nonconforming;
            b.   Any costs that are reasonably and directly attributable to
accomplishing the ordered compliance date, including demolition expenses,
relocation expenses, termination of leases, and discharge of mortgages;
            c.   Any return on investment since inception of the use, including
net income and depreciation;
            d.   The anticipated annual recovery of investment, including net
income and depreciation;
            e.   A reasonable closeout and termination period for the
nonconforming use.
         5.   The Board of Adjustment may request financial documentation from
the owner relating to the factors listed.
         6.   If the owner does not provide documentation, the Board of
Adjustment is authorized to make its determination of a compliance date based
upon any reasonably available public records as well as testimony at the public
hearing.
         7.   Failure by owner to provide the requested financial documents and
records shall not prevent the Board of Adjustment from setting a compliance
date.
      D.   Ceasing operations. If the Board of Adjustment establishes a
compliance date for a nonconforming use, the use must cease operations on that
date and it may not operate thereafter unless it becomes a conforming use.
      E.   Definition. For purposes of this subsection 5.10, OWNER means the
owner of the nonconforming use at the time of the Board of Adjustment's
determination of a compliance date for the nonconforming use.
      F.   Finality of decisions.
         1.   Decision to deny a request to establish a compliance date. A
decision by the Board of Adjustment to deny a request to establish a compliance
date is final unless appealed by an aggrieved party to district court within
ten calendar days.
         2.   Decision setting a compliance date. A decision by the Board of
Adjustment setting a compliance date is final unless appealed by an aggrieved
party to district court within ten calendar days.
(Ord. 04-2022-34, passed 4-12-22)
   5.11.   Concept Plans
      A.   Purpose. The purpose of a concept plan is to provide City Council an
opportunity to consider various development related aspects of a proposed
development at the rezoning phase prior to any plat or site plan submittal.
Concept plans are intended to determine how a future project could conform to
the city’s zoning code, Future Land Use Plan, subdivision code, Master
Thoroughfare Plan, and other applicable plans and regulations. Approval of a
concept plan shall not allow development to reduce the minimum requirements for
the requested zoning district and shall not constitute approval of any variance
or deviation to the minimum requirements of the zoning code.
      B.   Applicability.
         1.   Approval of a concept plan is required for every proposed planned
development, in accordance with subsection 5.08.
         2.   For all other zoning requests, approval of a concept plan is
encouraged for any property that is intended for development, subject to the
requirements listed in subsection 5.11.C below.
      C.   Content.
         1.   A concept plan that is voluntarily submitted shall, at a minimum,
contain adequate information to address the evaluation criteria listed in
subsection 5.11.D.
         2.   An application for a concept plan shall provide the following:
            a.   Payment of the application fee of $45;
            b.   Letter of intent providing a narrative of the proposal; and
            c.   Conceptual representation of each proposed use and a
generalized representation of proposed site improvements.
         3.   An applicant for a concept plan is encouraged to include any of
the following information that may be helpful in assessing the impacts of the
proposed development:
            a.   Conceptual representation of vehicular and pedestrian impacts
to neighboring properties, including proposed connections to existing and
planned driveways and roadways;
            b.   Conceptual representation of vehicular and pedestrian
circulation within the site, including right-of-way widths or proposed street
sections up to the connection with the public right-of-way;
            c.   Identification of all areas to be dedicated to the city or to
have public easements, such as open space and drainage areas;
            d.   Proposed number of dwelling units, which may be a range or
expressed in overall density, the total acreage for residential uses, and the
approximate square footage of buildings, by type, for non-residential uses;
            e.   Location and type of proposed screening between the site and
all adjacent property;
            f.   Indication of boundary or size of each phase of development,
if separate phases are proposed;
            g.   Description of how essential public services, including water,
sewer, and drainage, will be provided;
            h.   General location of the proposed parking areas;
            i.   A graphic rendering of the existing site conditions, which
depicts significant natural, topographical and physical features of the subject
property including contours, location of water features and floodplain on or
affecting the subject property, and existing drainage patterns;
            j.   Vicinity map (does not need to be scaled) indicating the area
in which the property is located; and
            k.   Other information the applicant and/or owner might wish to
include.
      D.   Review criteria. When considering a concept plan included with a
zoning request, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may
consider the following criteria:
         1.   Conformance with the natural site topography and landforms,
including natural drainage patterns and floodplain boundaries;
         2.   The impact of the proposed development on the safety,
convenience, and ease of vehicular traffic flow and pedestrian movement to and
from the site;
         3.   The impact of the proposed development on existing streets,
utilities, parks, schools, and other public facilities;
         4.   The impact of the proposed development on adjacent land uses and
the surrounding area;
         5.   Conformance with all applicable city requirements and
regulations.
      E.   Expiration and extension of concept plan.
         1.   If no progress towards completion of the project has been made
following approval of a concept plan, as progress is defined in subsection
5.02.A.3, the concept plan shall expire after two years from the date of
approval or the most recent action as defined in subsection 5.02.A.3.
         2.   The property will remain zoned as approved on the Official Zoning
District Map, but the concept plan will no longer be valid.
         3.   If the concept plan expires, a new concept plan meeting the
minimum requirements of the zoning district and the criteria listed in
subsection 5.11.C must be submitted and approved by City Council prior to
approval of any plat or site plan on the property. City Council may, if
requested by the applicant following expiration of the concept plan, vote to
allow the property to develop without an approved concept plan and be subject
to the minimum requirements of this code.
         4.   The City Manager's Designee may grant a two year extension of
validity for the concept plan. At the end of the two year extension, a second
extension may be granted by the City Manager's Designee for up to one year.
      F.   Concept plan modifications. Modifications to the concept plan
require approval by City Council, unless approved as an administrative
amendment.
         1.   Administrative amendment. The City Manager's Designee may approve
or defer an administrative amendment to City Council as follows:
            a.   Additions to buildings shown or described on the concept plan,
which do not increase the gross floor area of all buildings collectively by
more than 10%;
            b.   Minor relocation or reorientation of buildings, lot lines and/
or easements;
            c.   Relocation of points of access, if such relocation will not
hinder traffic circulation on adjacent public rights of way as determined by
the city's engineer. If access points were previously determined by an approved
Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), the City Manager's Designee may require that an
updated TIA be submitted that provides analysis of the modified access points;
            d.   Relocation of internal access and circulation that does not
impact access or traffic flow to and from streets that are external to the
development;
            e.   Relocation or rearrangement of parking areas where the overall
supply of parking is not substantially altered;
            f.   Reduction of established square footage or density
limitations;
            g.   Increase of landscaping or building setbacks;
            h.   Relocation of or increase in open space if the change furthers
the goals of this ordinance or the city's adopted Parks Master Plan; and
            i.   Modification of the location or size of proposed structural
stormwater controls based on an engineered stormwater design.
         2.   City Manager's Designee approval.
            a.   Upon receiving a request to modify an approved concept plan,
the City Manager's Designee will determine if proposed amendments to an
approved concept plan satisfy the above criteria listed in subsection 5.11.F.1.
            b.   City Council approval of a new or modified concept plan may be
required if the proposed development layout, character, or other conditions
affecting the development are substantially altered, as determined by the City
Manager's Designee.
            c.   The City Manager's Designee shall determine whether a request
for amendment shall be approved administratively, or defer the decision to City
Council at its next available meeting, within 30 days of receiving a request
for amendment of the concept plan.

   6.02.   Zoning Variance.
      A.   Purpose.
         1.   The Board of Adjustment is authorized in specific cases to grant
a variance from this Zoning Ordinance.
         2.   A variance is authorized by this Zoning Ordinance when such cases
are shown not to be contrary to the public interest if, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will
result in an undue hardship and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be
observed and substantial justice done.
         3.   The Board of Adjustment is not authorized to grant a variance
that will allow a use not authorized in the Use Chart or modify the standards
or conditions of a PD zoning district or SUP.
      B.   Zoning variance applicability. The Board of Adjustment is authorized
to grant a variance from the following regulations consistent with this
subsection 6.02:
         1.   Open space (yard) dimensions;
         2.   Lot dimensions;
         3.   Floor area;
         4.   Structure height;
         5.   Lot coverage.
      C.   Criteria for approval. The Board of Adjustment may not grant a
variance without first having given public notice and having held a public
hearing on the variance request in accordance with subsection 5.04 above and
this subsection 6.02.C.
         1.   Findings of fact. The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance if
the Board finds affirmatively that the following are true:
            a.   Due to special conditions that affect the subject property, an
unnecessary hardship will result from a literal interpretation of the
regulation that is the subject of the variance request;
            b.   The hardship is unique to the subject property in that it is
not commonly found on similar properties in the immediate vicinity;
            c.   The hardship is inherent to the property and is not self-
created;
            d.   The variance is not contrary to the public interest;
            e.   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the applicant;
            f.   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this Zoning Ordinance;
            g.   Public health, safety, and welfare will be secured; and
            h.   Substantial justice will be done.
         2.   Contextual factors in making determination. In making the
findings listed in subsection 6.02.C.1, the Board of Adjustment may consider
the following grounds to determine whether compliance with this Zoning
Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship:
            a.   The nature of the proposed use of the land involved;
            b.   The existing uses of land in the vicinity;
            c.   Whether the financial cost of compliance with the regulation
as written is greater than 50% of the appraised value of the structure as shown
on the most recent appraisal roll certified to the assessor for the city under
Tex. Tax Code § 26.01;
            d.   Whether compliance with the regulation as written would result
in a loss to the lot on which the structure is located of at least 25% of the
area on which development may physically occur;
            e.   Whether compliance with the regulation as written would result
in the structure violating a different requirement of a city ordinance,
building code, or other requirement;
            f.   Whether compliance with the regulation as written would result
in the unreasonable encroachment on an adjacent property or easement;
            g.   Whether the structure is a nonconforming structure under
subsection 3.07;
            h.   The probable effect the variance will have upon conditions of
public health, safety, convenience, and welfare; or
            i.   Whether the granting of the variance will adversely affect the
ability of adjacent property to develop or will prevent the orderly use of
adjacent property.
         3.   Record of findings. Such findings of the Board of Adjustment,
together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be
incorporated into the official minutes of Board of Adjustment meeting at which
the variance is considered.
         4.   Conditions of approval. In granting a variance, the Board of
Adjustment may prescribe conditions that it deems necessary to preserve the
public interest.
      D.   Concurring vote of 75% required. Pursuant to Tex. Local Gov’t Code §
211.009(c), the concurring vote of 75% of the members of the Board of
Adjustment is necessary for the Board to grant a variance.
      E.   Zoning variance denial. No request for a variance that has been
denied shall be further considered by the board under a subsequent request
unless:
         1.   Six months have elapsed from the date of denial; or
         2.   Conditions relative to other property in the immediate vicinity,
within the said six months period, have been changed or acted on by the board
or council so as to alter the facts and conditions on which the previous board
action was based.
   6.03.   Zoning Special Exception.
      A.   Purpose. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to hear and decide a
special exception in accordance with this subsection 6.03.
      B.   Zoning special exception defined. A special exception is an allowed
variation from the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance, but is differentiated
from a variance by the following:
         1.   No hardship required. A special exception does not require a
finding of an unnecessary hardship.
         2.   Specifically allowed and pre-determined by the Zoning Ordinance.
Approval of a special exception by the Board of Adjustment is specifically
provided for and defined in this Zoning Ordinance.
      C.   Requests for a zoning special exception. The Board of Adjustment may
grant a special exception upon receiving a written request from the property
owner or authorized agent.
      D.   Zoning special exception authorized. If the Board of Adjustment
finds that the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served and
the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be substantially
injured, the Board of Adjustment may authorize the following special exceptions
to the regulations herein established:
         1.   Nonconforming uses. Permit the reconstruction, extension, or
enlargement of a building occupied by a nonconforming use on the lot or tract
occupied by such building provided such reconstruction does not prevent the
return of such property to a conforming use and permit the expansion of off-
street parking or off-street loading for a nonconforming use.
         2.   Building setbacks. For existing buildings that were legally
constructed prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, the Board of
Adjustment may authorize a special exception to allow reconstruction of a
building over a setback line or allow a building to be set back further than a
build-to line established by this Zoning Ordinance.
         3.   Cell tower height.
            a.   The Board of Adjustment may approve a special exception for an
antenna support structure that exceeds 35 feet in height if the structure is
set back an additional foot from the minimum required setback for each foot in
height above 35 feet to a maximum height of 65 feet.
            b.   Only one antenna facility exceeding 35 feet in height is
permitted on each lot.
         4.   Landscaping. The Board of Adjustment may permit landscaping that
varies by more than 10% from the requirements of subsection 4.01.
      E.   Approval conditions. In granting a special exception, the Board of
Adjustment may impose such conditions as are necessary to protect adjacent
property owners and to ensure the public health, safety and general welfare,
including but not limited to conditions specifying the period during which a
nonconforming use may continue to operate or exist before being brought into
conformance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      F.   Concurring vote of 75% required. Pursuant to Tex. Local Gov’t Code §
211.009(c), the concurring vote of 75% of the members of the Board of
Adjustment is necessary to grant a special exception.
      G.   Zoning special exception denial. No request for a zoning special
exception that has been denied shall be further considered by the board under a
subsequent request unless:
         1.   Six months have elapsed from the date of denial; or
         2.   Conditions relative to other property in the immediate vicinity,
within the said six month period, have been changed or acted on by the board or
council so as to alter the facts and conditions on which the previous board
action was based.

the State of Texas establish the city's authority that is exercised within this
chapter:

power granted by municipalities by these statutes, the City Charter of
Cleburne, and the Texas Constitution.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.03 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate signs of all types (temporary and
permanent) in a manner that:
   (A)   Protects constitutional rights to free speech by preserving
opportunities for expression through signs, while avoiding content-based
distinctions, and providing clear approval standards;
   (B)   Protects public health and safety by:
      (1)   Minimizing visual traffic hazards, distractions, and obstructions
for motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians, or signs causing confusion by virtue
of visual similarity to traffic control signs;
      (2)   Not creating a nuisance to persons using the public rights-of-way;
      (3)   Not causing a nuisance to occupancy of adjacent and contiguous
property by their brightness, size, height, or movement;
      (4)   Minimizing obstructions to firefighting or police surveillance; and
      (5)   Encouraging the upgrading, updating, or removing signs that are
poorly maintained, or do not conform to this chapter, and preventing signs that
are potentially dangerous due to structural deficiencies and disrepair from
hazards caused by collapse, fire, collision, decay, or abandonment.
   (C)   Maintains and enhances the aesthetic environment and the city's
ability to attract sources of economic development and growth by providing
those signs:
      (1)   Promote the community's appearance, character, quality, and
business climate by encouraging signs that are attractive and functional for
their intended purpose, and that are in scale and harmony with the development
site and building(s) and with surrounding areas;
      (2)   Reduce and prevent visual clutter or potential deterioration of the
community's appearance and attractiveness;
      (3)   Implements the goals and policies of the city's adopted planning
policies, commercial and historical overlays, zoning regulations, and
International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) standards by establishing
uniform standards and procedures to regulate the size, type, number, design,
placement, illumination, timeframe for display, and maintenance of signs; and
      (4)   Do not interfere with scenic views.
   (D)   Regulates signs by classifying each sign according to its design and
construction type and by regulating those sign types as they occur within
certain Sign Districts throughout Cleburne. These regulations address the type,
number, size, height, and placement within a site for signs according to their
location in the various Sign Districts.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.04 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   This chapter applies within the city's corporate boundaries, except

at a time, place, or manner that this chapter prohibits.
   (B)   Exemptions. This chapter does not apply to signs listed in §

   (C)   Message neutrality.
      (1)   Content neutrality. Non-commercial speech is not regulated. This
chapter is not intended to limit commercial messaging except to further the
goals and objectives of this chapter. If there are any conflicts between the
regulations of this chapter and a commercial message, the Director will
interpret the regulation so as to create minimal impact on the commercial
message itself.
      (2)   Substitution allowed. Any sign authorized in this chapter may
contain any noncommercial copy or message in place of any other authorized
commercial or noncommercial message without an additional permit or approval so
long as the sign complies with the other requirements of this chapter and other
applicable city ordinances. Message substitution is a continuing right which
may be exercised any number of times. The message substitution right does not:
         (a)   Create a right to increase the total amount of sign display area
on a site or parcel;
         (b)   Create a right to substitute an off-site commercial message in
place of an on-site commercial message;
         (c)   Affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device
must be properly permitted;

compliance with this chapter or applicable building codes, safety codes, and
applicable rules for sign size, height, orientation, setback, separation, or
illumination.
   (D)   Signs within Planned Developments (PDs).
      (1)   Applicability. This chapter shall apply to signs within a PD unless
otherwise specified within the PD adopting ordinance. To the extent that a sign
plan does not address the type, area, height, design features, or other sign
requirements, this chapter shall apply to those features.
      (2)   Master sign plans. The master sign plan shall comply with the
requirements established in §
156.56.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.05 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REGULATIONS.
   Generally, refer to Tex. Local Gov’t Code § 211.013 (Conflict with Other
Laws) if this chapter conflicts with other regulations. Except as provided in
Tex. Local Gov’t Code § 211.013 (Conflict with Other Laws), if any provision of
this chapter conflicts with state or federal law, state or federal law
controls.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.06 RELATIONSHIP TO PRIVATE RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter does not abrogate any deed restriction, covenant, or any other
private agreement or restriction on the use of signage on private property.
However, if the provisions of this chapter are more restrictive or impose
higher standards than any private restriction, the requirements of this chapter
control. Where the provisions of any private restriction are more restrictive
or impose higher standards than the provisions of this chapter, the private
restrictions control if properly enforced by a person having the legal right to
enforce those restrictions. The city shall not enforce private restrictions.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.07 AMENDMENTS.

notices shall be provided at the City Council's discretion, unless otherwise
required by law.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)

   (P)   Signs (illuminated from within or without) that are illuminated in
such a manner, to such intensity, or without shielding that is greater than the
prescribed amounts in §
156.37, so as to constitute a hazard to the operation of motor vehicles upon a
street or substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of property.
   (Q)   Signs located on private property without the consent of the owner of
the property.
   (R)   Off-premise outdoor commercial advertising signs.
   (S)   All signs not expressly allowed, exempted, or permitted under this
chapter.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.22 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Installation.
      (1)   Signs and sign structures shall comply with the city's adopted
building codes and all other regulatory requirements.
      (2)   An applicant shall provide all applicable plans and obtain permits
before installing any sign.
   (B)   Maintenance.
      (1)   All signs, together with any supports, braces, guys and anchors,
structural components and footings, and colors, shall remain in good repair and
be properly maintained.
      (2)   For wall signs, the sign installation area on the building wall
shall be cleaned, patched, and painted upon sign removal.
      (3)   Any defective signs or damaged parts or components of a sign shall
be replaced. Upon notice from the city to replace damaged or missing components
of the sign, the owner has until the time specified in the notice to make the
repairs.
      (4)   All components of a sign shall keep the adjacent properties free of
debris, weeds, trash, or other public nuisances.
      (5)   The Director may enforce the standards as provided in §
156.70 and §
156.71.
   (C)   Vertical clearance for signs projecting over sidewalks, walkways, and
driveways.
      (1)   The bottom edge of any projecting sign, attached awning/canopy
sign, hanging sign, marquee sign, and any other sign that extends or projects
over a sidewalk, walkway, or driveway shall be at least eight feet above grade
as shown in §
156.35, unless specified elsewhere in this chapter.
      (2)   Projecting signs, attached awning/canopy signs, hanging signs,
marquee signs, and any other sign that extends or projects over public
sidewalks shall not extend into or occupy more than half the width of the
sidewalk or five feet (whichever is less), as measured from the building wall.
   (D)   Signs in right-of-way. No person shall place or install a sign or
supporting structures within the right-of-way of any public street except as
provided in §
156.57.
   (E)   Administrative interpretations. Interpretations of this chapter are to
be made initially by the Director. All interpretations of this chapter are to
be exercised considering the message neutrality and message substitution
policies. Where a particular type of sign is proposed, and the type is neither
expressly allowed nor prohibited by this chapter, or whenever a sign does not
qualify as a "structure" as defined in the building code, as adopted by the
city, the Director shall approve or disapprove the application based on the
most similar sign type that is legal under the current code, using physical and
structural similarity, that is expressly regulated by this chapter. Appeal to
the City Council over denial of an application may be taken, as provided in §
156.59.
   (F)   Responsibility for compliance. The responsibility for compliance with
this chapter rests jointly and severally upon the sign owner, the permit
holder, all parties holding the present right of possession, and control of the
property where a sign is located, mounted, or installed.
   (G)   Billboards. New billboards are prohibited. Existing legal
nonconforming billboards may not be converted to digital billboards.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.23 SIGN TYPES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   This chapter establishes the required standards for signs from the
following sign categories:
         (a)   Detached signs;
         (b)   Attached signs;
         (c)   Incidental signs;
         (d)   Temporary signs;
         (e)   Special signs;
         (f)   Vehicle signs; and
         (g)   Historical signs.
      (2)   This classification system provides flexibility for persons and
businesses who display signs, avoids sign distinctions that depend on a sign's
message, supports the community's aesthetic goals, and avoids potential traffic
hazards and clutter.
   (B)   Generally. Sections and subsections in §§
156.35  through
156.42 for each sign type address the following standards:
      (1)   An introductory paragraph defining the sign type;
      (2)   Images or graphics that illustrate the sign type;
      (3)   A table summarizing the applicable sign standards, including:
         (a)   If the sign type is allowed in the designated areas provided in
§
156.35;
         (b)   If a sign permit is required;
         (c)   The maximum number of signs of each type;
         (d)   Maximum sign dimensions, including:
            1.   Sign area;
            2.   Height;
            3.   Location/setbacks; and
            4.   Other requirements.
         (e)   If the sign features provided in §
156.25 are allowed or required:
            1.   Electronic message centers;
            2.   Illumination features; and
            3.   Changeable copies; and
            4.   Neon.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.24 COMPUTATION AND INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Sign area, sign faces and sign application.
      (1)   Sign area. Sign area means the area enclosed by the smallest
imaginary regular shape (e.g., parallelogram, triangle, circle, trapezoid) or
combination of regular shapes that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem, or other display, or combination thereof,
together with any material or color forming an integral part of the display or
used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it
is placed. Sign area includes such features as decorative or ornamental
elements or features, borders, trims, but not including the architectural
enclosure or supporting structure which is used solely for support of the sign,
such as poles, columns and cables, pylons, or other architectural enclosures.
      (2)   Sign faces. When a sign has multiple faces, the sign area shall be
calculated as follows:
         (a)   One-sided sign. The area will be the area of the one face.
         (b)   Two-sided sign, front and back. The sign area is calculated
separately for each side. The area of each side shall not exceed the maximum
permitted sign area.
         (c)   Signs faces on different planes of a sign structure.
            1.   Two sign faces where the interior angle between the two faces
is 45 degrees or less. The sign area is calculated separately for each sign
face. The maximum permitted sign area applies to each sign face.
            2.   Two sign faces where the interior angle between the two faces
is greater than 45 degrees. The sign area is the sum of the individual sign
faces. The combined sign area of the two faces shall not exceed the maximum
permitted sign area.
   Figure 2: Measurement of Sign Face (1 or 2 faces)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/948048d06474cac31c32c8809bdeca24f7aca423/
IMAGES/0-0-0-8079.jpg]
            3.   Where more than two sign faces exist on a single sign
structure, the sign area is the sum of the individual sign faces. The combined
sign area of the faces shall not exceed the maximum permitted sign area as
shown in the graphic below.
         (d)   All signs on a single supporting structure shall be measured
together as though they were one sign to determine the total sign area, except
that signs separated by more than 36 inches of air space at every point between
the signs, and not separated by being located on different planes of a sign
structure, shall be measured separately and added together to determine the
total sign area.
         (e)   Irregular shaped signs. The sign area is the area enclosed by
the smallest imaginary regular shape, or combination of shapes, which would
fully contain all portions of the sign when rotated horizontally around the
sign. Marquee signs are not considered freeform if information is only
displayed on the front and back.
   (B)   Manner of measurement. The measurement required for signs by this
chapter shall be made using the following procedures:
      (1)   Setback. To apply the setback provisions of this chapter for signs
at any one point, the following measuring procedure shall be used:
         (a)   Draw an imaginary vertical line extending upwards from the curb-
line of the premises;
         (b)   Beginning at any point on the vertical line, draw an imaginary
horizontal line perpendicular to the vertical line and curb-line extending
toward the premises; and
         (c)   Beginning at the point where the vertical line intersects the
horizontal line, measure along the horizontal line for the required setback.
      (2)   Height. The maximum height of a sign mounted to the ground shall be
determined by the method of measurement that allows the greater height, as
follows:
         (a)   Curb-line measurement. Measure along a vertical line extended
upward from the nearest curb-line of the public street fronting the premises
where the sign is to be located, to the maximum height allowed for the sign.
From that point, extend a horizontal line to where the sign is to be located.
The horizontal line is the maximum height allowed at that location for that
Sign District.
         (b)   Street level measurement. Along US Highway 67 and the Chisholm
Trail Parkway, the height of a sign may be measured from the principal lane,
the frontage road, or the ground, whichever allows the greatest height. At the
highest point of the sign, draw a horizontal line to the outer extremities of
the sign. At the center of the horizontal line, draw a vertical line to the
street level (the level of the principal lane, the frontage road or the
ground). The vertical line may not exceed the height allowed for a sign at that
location for that Sign District.
         (c)   Natural ground level measurement. At the highest point of the
sign, draw a horizontal line to the outer extremities of the sign. At the
center of the horizontal line, draw a vertical line to the natural ground level
below (the "natural ground level" shall include any changes in topography
necessary for development of the property). The vertical line may not exceed
the height allowed for the sign at that location for that Sign District.
   (C)   Sign measurement variables. Signs may be allocated by:
      (1)   Lot;
      (2)   Storefront;
      (3)   Entrance;
      (4)   Grounded canopy;
      (5)   Window; or
      (6)   Building.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.25 SIGN FEATURES.
   Signs may incorporate the following features established below; however,
these features shall only be allowed as established in the tables in §
156.35.
   (A)   Illumination.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   A sign that is "illuminated" means any sign that incorporates
illumination on or in the sign, or that directs illumination toward or over all
or part of the sign, or that is created by the projection of illuminations onto
a surface (such as a building wall).
         (b)   Permanent signs may be illuminated by static and continuous
internal and external illumination configurations as indicated in the tables in
§§
156.35 through
156.42 for each sign type.
         (c)   Temporary signs shall not be illuminated.
      (2)   Standards.
         (a)   Signs that are illuminated shall not operate at brightness
levels of more than 0.5 foot-candles (5.38 lux) above ambient light conditions
at the property line, as measured using a foot-candle meter. Illumination
levels shall be measured in foot-candles with a meter sensor in a horizontal
position at an approximate height of three feet above grade.
         (b)   Illumination shall not include animation, moving video, or
flashing, scrolling, intermittent, moving lights, rotating beams or flashing
beacon lights.
         (c)   Signs that are illuminated shall not be illuminated by flashing,
intermittent, or moving lights or lights that consist of an image projected
upon a stationary object.
         (d)   The illumination source for a sign or building shall be shielded
from view from any point on the ground by either an opaque or translucent
material.
         (e)   Illumination shall comply with all applicable provisions of the
city's Adopted Electrical Code.
         (f)   Signs with illumination in or within 100 feet of a residential
area shall be reduced to 50% of the maximum brightness level allowed by this
subchapter between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
   (B)   Electronic message centers.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   A sign that incorporates an electronic message center (EMC)
means a sign that displays a digital copy, including any illuminated sign on
which the illumination is not kept stationary or constant in intensity and
color when the sign is in use, including any light emitting diode (LED) or
digital panel, and which varies in color or intensity.
         (b)   Permanent signs may incorporate EMCs as indicated in the tables
in §§
156.35 through
156.42 for each sign type.
         (c)   Temporary signs shall not incorporate EMCs.
      (2)   Standards.
         (a)   Hold time.
            1.   Each message on the sign must be displayed for at least 15
seconds duration.
            2.   Message changes shall be completed instantaneously and shall
be imperceptible.
         (b)   Electronic copy.
            1.   Signs incorporating EMCs shall only contain static messages
changed exclusively by dissolve or fade transitions, and shall not have
movement or the appearance or optical illusion of movement during the static
display period of any part of the sign.
            2.   A static message shall not include any flashing or varying of
light intensity, and the message shall not scroll.
            3.   The change of message using dissolve or fade transition shall
not exceed two seconds of time between each message displayed on the sign.
         (c)   Brightness.
            1.   The intensity of the light source for an EMC shall not produce
glare, the effect of which constitutes a traffic hazard or is otherwise
detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare.
            2.   An EMC shall not operate at brightness levels of more than 0.5
foot-candles (5.38 lux) above ambient light conditions at the property line, as
measured using a foot-candle meter. Illumination levels shall be measured in
foot-candles with a meter sensor in a horizontal position at an approximate
height of three feet above grade.
            3.   Prior to the issuance of a sign permit, the applicant shall
provide written certification from the sign manufacturer that the light
intensity has been factory pre-set not to exceed 0.5 foot-candles (5.38 lux)
above ambient light and that the intensity level is protected by the end-user
of the sign.
         (d)   Technology.
            1.   The technology currently being deployed for EMCs is Light
Emitting Diode (LED), but there may be alternate, preferred, or superior
technology available in the future that may be considered by the Director.
            2.   Any other technology that complies with the performance
standards for EMCs, including the maximum brightness levels as stated in §§
156.20 through
156.25 is permitted.
         (e)   Automatic shutoff. An EMC shall:
            1.   Have automatic dimmer software or solar sensors to control
brightness for nighttime viewing and variations in daytime ambient light;
            2.   Include systems and monitoring to either turn the display off,
show "full black" on the display, or include a default mechanism that freezes
the sign in one position if a malfunction occurs;
            3.   Be designed so that a catastrophic power surge will cause the
sign to go dark or to deploy the maximum brightness limitations; and
            4.   Automatically adjust the intensity of its display according to
natural ambient light conditions.
         (f)   Resolution.
            1.   EMC faces shall have a pixel pitch of no more than 16
millimeters.
               a.   PIXEL PITCH means a measurement of the resolution of a
digital display, in terms of the distance (generally in millimeters) between
the center of a LED cluster (pixel) and the center of the next LED pixel.
               b.   A lower pixel pitch measurement indicates a higher display
resolution.
            2.   This section only applies to sign(s) that are constructed,
rebuilt, or replaced after the effective date of this chapter.
      (3)   Maintenance.
         (a)   The sign owner shall provide the Director with the phone number
and email address of a person who is available to be contacted at any time and
who is able to turn off the EMC promptly after a malfunction occurs.
         (b)   The light modules on EMCs shall be repaired or replaced as they
become broken, burned-out, or substantially dimmed.
   (C)   Changeable copy.
      (1)   Generally. Permanent signs may incorporate changeable copy as
indicated in the tables in §§ 156.35 through 156.42 for each sign type.
      (2)   Standards. Changeable copies may be illuminated if the dimensions
and standards allow illumination for the sign type in the particular Sign
District.
   (D)   Neon.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Only permanent, attached signs within the boundaries of the DTC
(Downtown Core Overlay), as defined in the zoning ordinance, may incorporate
neon. Although overlays are not otherwise used for regulating sign features in
this chapter, the DTC is maintained as an exception due to its distinct
character and design standards applicable to the downtown area regardless of
underlying zoning.
         (b)   Temporary signs shall not incorporate neon.
      (2)   Standards.
         (a)   Neon may be shaped to form objects or letters, or to outline
portions of a sign.
         (b)   Neon letters or characters may appear as a freestanding object,
mounted directly on a wall surface, mounted on a panel, or contained in open
channel letters.

SIGN STANDARDS
§ 156.35 SIGN DISTRICTS AND SIGN ALLOCATIONS.
   (A)   Sign Districts. This chapter regulates signs by location. The city’s
zoning ordinance regulates use, setbacks, building size, site design, and land
use allowances by zoning districts. For the purposes of this chapter, zoning
districts are organized into sign districts to produce desirable sign outcomes.
The sign districts are established in Table 1: Sign Districts.

requirements for each sign type references the sections and subsections that
apply to each sign type.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.36 DETACHED SIGNS.
   (A)   Detached signs are classified into one of the following sign types:
monument (major and minor) signs, pole (major and minor) signs, or subdivision
entry signs. Their associated regulations are established in this subchapter.
      (1)   A lot may have one detached sign, but not two or more unless
specified elsewhere in this section.

§ 156.41 VEHICLE SIGNS.
   (A)   Permit not required . Signs on vehicles do not require a sign permit
but must comply with this section.
   (B)   Vehicle used as a sign. No vehicle (including trailers or other non-
motorized wheeled vehicles carrying signs) shall be parked so that it functions
primarily as a sign unless exempt by §§ 156.20 through 156.25.
   (C)   Factors. Factors to determine whether a vehicle is being used
primarily as a sign include, but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Is the vehicle parked at a prominent location on the lot?
      (2)   Is the vehicle inoperative and displaying a message?
      (3)   Is the sign easily read by a person in the right-of-way?
      (4)   Is the vehicle parked at the same or similar locations for several
hours during the same day or for several days during the same week?
      (5)   Does the vehicle use lights to display a message, including LEDs,
strobes, or incandescent bulbs?
      (6)   Are there any stated or apparent reasons, other than its function
as a sign, that justify the presence of the vehicle at that location?
   (D)   Presumption of use as a sign. While other factors may also establish a
violation, a vehicle presumptively violates this provision if the first five
questions are affirmative and there is no compelling answer to the sixth
question to justify the parking location as opposed to some less conspicuous
location.
   (E)   Limitations on vehicle signs. Vehicles (including trailers) may have
signs subject to the following limitations;
      (1)   Paper signs, electronic message signs, fabric signs, changeable
copy signs, or signs with a scrolling mechanism to change messages are not
allowed.
      (2)   The vehicle must have current state registration and be maintained
in running order.
      (3)   Signage is limited to a copy that is professionally painted or
printed on vinyl wrap that is maintained in good condition and is not faded or
torn.
      (4)   A vehicle displaying a sign shall be parked no closer than ten feet
from a right-of-way and shall not occupy a parking space, fire lane, or drive
aisle that is required for the principal use on the property.
(Ord. 06-2025-20, passed 6-10-25)
§ 156.42 HISTORICAL SIGNS.
   Certain signs within the city which have been designated as a historical
sign by City Council action shall comply with the requirements of this section.
   (A)   Designation. Based on a survey of potential historic signs produced by
the city and any public nomination of a sign for historical status, the City
Council shall designate the sign or signs which it deems historically
significant as a historical sign. A sign may qualify as a historical sign if
it:
      (1)   Is or has been associated with a business enterprise or public
activity which has made significant contribution to the growth and development
of Cleburne or Johnson County;
      (2)   Is an example of distinctive architectural design prior to the
adoption of this chapter;
      (3)   Is associated with the contributions of a culturally significant
personality, building, or landmark; or
      (4)   Is not dilapidated or deteriorated to a point where it constitutes
a public hazard.
   (B)   Property owner support. The designation of any sign as a historical
sign must be requested by the property owner for designation and the property
owner's commitment for continued maintenance.
   (C)   Continued nonconformance and exemption. A sign which has been
designated as a historical sign is exempt from the standards of this chapter
except those that regulate maintenance. Any maintenance of the sign or
preservation work on the sign which may negate the sign's right to remain in
place as a nonconforming sign will not trigger a requirement to meet the
standards of this chapter in the case of a historical sign. In addition, any
work on the sign for the purpose of restoration or preservation which may
exceed 50% of the cost of replacement shall not trigger a requirement to meet
the standards of this chapter.
   (D)   Demolition. Any demolition permit sought which would lead to or
require the demolition of a sign designated as a historical sign shall be
delayed for 90 days from the date of application for a demolition permit so
that alternate locations for, or other dispositions of, the sign may be
arranged. If a workable alternative is not brought forth within the 90-day
demolition delay period, the sign may be demolished. However, if an alternate
location is agreed upon by the City Council, the demolition permit delay shall
continue for a reasonable period to allow implementation of the alternative. In
no case shall the total demolition delay exceed 120 days.

storefront wall's area (excluding windows and doors).
      (2)   Sign height.
         (a)   The sign height may exceed the maximum allowance by up to 20% of
the general allowance, provided there is a proportional decrease in sign width
(up to 20%) as the sign extends above the max height.
         (b)   Increasing the effective height of the sign by approving a berm
of up to three feet if one or more of the following conditions are present:
            1.   Utility equipment blocks all or part of the sign;
            2.   Drainage/ponding issues threaten the structural integrity of
the sign; or
            3.   The sign is located within 200 feet of signs that are of equal
or greater height to the proposed sign including the berm.
      (3)   Sign consolidation.
         (a)   Replace one major monument sign with no more than three minor
monument signs on a multi-tenant lot with right-of-way frontage of at least 150
feet provided each sign is no more than 20% of the size allowed for a major
sign in the applicable Sign District.
         (b)   The Director may allow consolidation of multiple smaller signs
into one larger sign under a Master Sign Plan, provided the height is not
increased and driver visibility is preserved.

      (2)   The City Council may authorize a variance to any restriction
established in this chapter or if alternative compliance cannot be achieved.
   (B)   Application. Any applicant who seeks to deviate from the terms of this

chapter. The application must be submitted through the permitting process and
include a non-refundable application fee of $750.
   (C)   Review.
      (1)   The Director will review a variance application to determine if it
is complete.
      (2)   If the application is incomplete, the Director will provide a list

   (D)   Approval criteria. City Council may consider the following criteria
when granting a variance to the provisions in this chapter:
      (1)   Special conditions exist which are peculiar to the land, structure,
or building involved and are not applicable to other lands, buildings or
structures in the same vicinity. The city may attach conditions to granting all
or a portion of any variance necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter;
      (2)   The strict interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
vicinity under the terms of this chapter. This condition of comparable
enjoyment does not apply to properties with signs that predate the adoption of
these restrictions nor those properties that hold vested rights of
nonconformance;
      (3)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant and such conditions and circumstances do not merely
constitute monetary hardship or inconveniences;
      (4)   Granting the variance will meet the objectives of this chapter and
not be injurious to the adjoining property owners or otherwise detrimental to
the public welfare;
      (5)   The request will be the minimum variance necessary to alleviate the
special hardship or practical difficulty faced by the applicant in meeting the
requirements of this chapter; and
      (6)   The variance remains consistent with the overall regulatory
framework of this chapter, excluding considerations related to sign content,
message, or viewpoint.

the determination of the Director regarding a sign permit by filing an appeal.
   (B)   Appeals of administrative decisions.
      (1)   To determine the suitability of alternative materials and methods
of construction and provide for reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this chapter, the City Council shall hear appeals about any decision of the
Director regarding a sign permit.
      (2)   Any appeal shall be brought by written application specifying the
grounds for the appeal, filed by the applicant of the sign permit with the
Director within ten business days following the action which is the subject of
the appeal.
      (3)   Enforcement of this chapter shall be stayed pending the appeal.
      (4)   The Director will place the item on the next available City Council
agenda. In hearing the appeal, the City Council shall review the Director's
decision, and then act on the appeal. The City Council's decision is final.

as provided in this section. The Director shall deliver or send a written
notice and order to the owner of an unlawful, discontinued, or abandoned sign
or the owner of the premises where the unlawful sign is located. A notice and
order sent or delivered to the person listed by the district appraisal roll as
the owner of the premises where the unlawful, discontinued, or abandoned sign

reaches its decision, unless the sign presents a threat to the public safety by
virtue of its physical condition.
      (3)   Impoundment, redemption, and disposal. The following applies to the
impoundment, redemption, or disposal of an unlawful or abandoned sign:
         (a)   Any sign which is removed by the Director pursuant to this
chapter shall be impounded, transported to, and stored by the Director at a
location designated for such purpose. Records shall be kept of the storage
location for that sign. The Director shall send a letter to the owner of that
sign, if known, or, if not known, to the owner or person in control of the
premises where the sign was located, giving notice of impoundment.
         (b)   The Director shall hold the sign in storage for at least 45
calendar days after notice of impoundment has been mailed. The city may recover
reasonable costs for hauling and storing the sign. Any portable sign may be
redeemed by the owner upon the payment of a fee to the city for hauling the
sign to storage, plus a per day storage fee. Any non-portable sign may be
redeemed by the owner upon payment of the cost of removal and hauling the sign
to storage, as determined by the Director, plus a per day storage fee. These
fees shall be established by the City Council.
         (c)   Any sign not reclaimed by the owner within 30 calendar days of
the mailing of the notice of impoundment may be disposed of in accordance with

right-of-way that may impact existing or proposed city facilities, including
infrastructure, or another service provider's existing or proposed facilities.
The public service provider shall provide to the Director plans of record
within 90 days of the request, or in accordance with an alternate schedule as
agreed to by both parties, to the extent such records are available. Public
release of such records shall be in accordance with the Public Information Act,
Tex. Government Code, Chapter 552.
      (4)   If the release of the location of any utility, including water and

if plans of record submitted under this section include information expressly
designated by the public service provider as a trade secret or other
confidential information protected from disclosure by state law, the Director
may not disclose that information to the public without the consent of the
public service provider, unless otherwise compelled by an opinion of the
attorney general pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, as amended, or
by a court having jurisdiction of the matter pursuant to applicable law. This
section may not be construed to authorize a public service provider to

direct or indirect costs incurred by the city have been reimbursed. No
additional permits shall be granted to the contractor for a period of one year
from the date of the conviction.
      (8)   If a public service provider utilizes its own employees to perform
permitted work, and the provider's employee is convicted of an offense under
this chapter, no additional permits shall be issued to the service provider
until the offense has been corrected and any costs incurred by the city have
been reimbursed. This provision shall not prohibit a public service provider
from performing work in an emergency situation.
      (9)   In the event the person or public service provider believes it
should not be held responsible for costs assessed pursuant to divisions (7) or
(8) above, the person or provider may file a request for a refund within 60

the upcoming year. The maintenance bond shall guarantee the work for two years
from the date of its completion and shall be in the amount of 100% of the cost
of the construction work, including the cost of the restoration of the public
right-of-way, to be performed in the upcoming year. Each bond shall be executed
by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Texas and
acceptable to the city. At the option of the service provider, maintenance
bonds may be provided for each project.

waiver, the Director, with good cause, may grant a waiver to the bonding
requirements. In making this decision, the Director shall take into account,
among other things:

city's
rights-of-way;
            2.   The public service provider's record of compliance with this
chapter;

provider to complete the proposed project, and;
            4.   Any other factors deemed relevant to management of the city's
rights-of-way.

work consisting of aerial construction except that a bond as provided for
herein may be required of a provider that cannot demonstrate a record of at
least four years' performance of work in any municipal public right-of-way free
of currently unsatisfied claims by a municipality for damage to the right-of-
way.
   (D)   The requirements for insurance may be satisfied by public service
providers with a current franchise or license or other agreement if their
current franchise or license adequately provides for insurance coverage which
will afford equivalent protection for the city. The requirements for bonds may
be satisfied by public service providers with a current franchise, interlocal
or license agreement if the agreement adequately provides for bonds.
   (E)   After registration has been completed, a separate construction permit
for each work location must be obtained from the city's Engineering Department.
Nothing in this section relieves a public service provider from obtaining a
construction permit under this chapter to perform work in the public right-of-
way, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

way to be performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in faithful and strict
compliance with the permit, this chapter, other city ordinances, and
regulations promulgated by the Director relating to construction within the
public right-of-way.
   (B)   The installation, replacement, repair, or maintenance of any city
facility by the permittee shall be subject to inspection and approval by the
city. The permittee agrees to cooperate fully with the city in conducting the
inspection. Such inspections shall be conducted concurrent with the

required by the city pursuant to such an inspection.
   (C)   The permittee shall maintain the construction area in a manner that
avoids health hazards, and hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic until

provider shall contact property owners and acquire easements or remove the
facilities from private property.

for other good cause, the Director may grant an exception upon request.
   (R)   No pavement cuts in newly constructed, reconstructed, or resurfaced
(greater than one inch) asphalt streets shall be made for 60 months after the
substantial completion of the street work. The Director may grant an exception
based on the public service provider's written demonstration, if he finds that
the following criteria have been met:
      (1)   Boring or jacking without disturbing the pavement is not practical
due to physical characteristics of the street or alley or other utility
conflicts; and
      (2)   Alternative utility alignments that do not involve excavating the
street or alley are found to be impracticable; and
      (3)   The proposed excavation cannot reasonably be delayed until the 60
months deferment period has lapsed; or

(Ord. 05-2018-36, passed 5-8-18)
§ 158.007 SERVICE UNIT DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted
engineering and planning standards.
   (B)   For water and wastewater impact fees, service units shall be
calculated in accordance with the attached
Appendix A – Table of Water and Wastewater Service Unit Equivalencies, as
determined by the size of the water meter(s) for the development, or
alternatively, as approved the Director of Public Works as a result of an
engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to
perform such professional engineering services in the State of Texas, which
demonstrates that the number of service unit equivalents (SUE’s) for the new
development will be different than those indicated by the size of the water
meter.
   (C)   If the Director of Public Works determines that the water pressure in
the city's transmission main is significantly higher or lower than standard
pressure such that the size of the water meter is not indicative of actual
service demand, the Director may adjust the number of SUE’s based on a smaller
or larger sized meter which more accurately reflects the flow rate and the
system pressure conditions.
   (D)   In determining the number of service units for water and wastewater,
the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Each new freestanding building requires a new water meter, except
as provided in division (2).
      (2)   Where a site is redeveloped (clearance and reconstruction), no new
service units will be attributed to such redevelopment, provided that the water
meter is of the same size as the development previously occupying the site. If
meter size is increased, the number of service units will be based upon the
increase in capacity of the meter.
      (3)   Existing buildings or land uses may be expanded using existing
meter service. No service units will be attributed to such development if the
water meter size remains the same. If the meter size is increased, the number
of service units will be based upon the increase in capacity of the meter.
      (4)   If an existing structure or use does not require a water meter for
water or wastewater service, or does not generate the need for water or
wastewater service, no service units will be attributable to such use or
structure.
      (5)   Upon wastewater tap purchase for lots for which no water meter has
been purchased, service units shall be established by a professional engineer
licensed in the State of Texas, shall be reviewed by the Director of Public
Works, which shall designate the appropriate number of service units.
      (6)   In determining the number of service units for wastewater impact
fees, no service units will be attributed to irrigation meters.
      (7)   Service units attributed to irrigation meters within the medians
and parkways of thoroughfares as shown on the city's thoroughfare plan shall be
paid in accordance with the development agreement between the city and the
developer.
      (8)   A one-time credit for a three-fourths inch irrigation meter shall
be attributed for the landscaping of a residential subdivision's entryways.
Additional charges for larger meter(s) shall be paid by the developer/owner.
   (F)   For roadways, service units shall be calculated in accordance with
Appendix B – Table of Vehicle-Mile Equivalencies.
   (G)   The City Council may revise the service unit equivalency tables
according to the procedure set forth in Tex. Local Gov’t Code Ch. 395 and its
successors.
(Ord. 05-2018-36, passed 5-8-18)
§ 158.008 ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be made as
follows:
      (1)   For new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the
city's subdivision regulations after June 20, 1987, or for which replatting
results in an increase in the number of service units after such date,
assessment shall be at the time of subdivision final plat approval, and shall
be the amount of the impact fee per service unit, as provided in the exhibits
to this chapter that are in effect at the time of subdivision final plat
approval. For a new development which has received final plat approval before
February 13, 2018, assessment shall be as adopted by the city on February 13,
2018.
      (2)   For new development which has received final plat approval prior to
June 20, 1987, and for which no replatting is necessary prior to the issuance
of a building permit, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building
permit, and shall be the amount of the impact fee per service unit set forth in
this chapter that is in effect at the time of building permit application.
      (3)   For new development which occurs or is proposed to occur without
platting, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit or water
or sewer tap purchase (whichever occurs first), and shall be the amount of the
impact fee per service unit set forth in the exhibits to this chapter that are
in effect at the time of building permit application.
      (4)   For water and wastewater facilities, fees shall not be assessed to
a development for which taps previously were purchased and which development
does not result in an increase in the number of living unit equivalents as
determined by the service unit equivalency table. If the exchange of said taps
will result in an increase in the number of SUE’s, impact fees for the increase
in the number of SUE’s shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter that are in effect at the time of subdivision plat approval.
      (5)   Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as
a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to
assessment or collection of a water or wastewater impact fee. However, if the
fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for
domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on
the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the current owner of the property
shall be assessed the impact fees currently in effect at the time such
conversion is established by the city for the fire protection capacity which
has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic
capacity.
   (B)   Following assessment of the impact fee above, no additional impact
fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the
number of service units increases.
   (C)   Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new
assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development
is filed.
   (D)   For purposes of this section, a final plat shall not include an
amending plat.
(Ord. 05-2018-36, passed 5-8-18)
§ 158.009 CALCULATION AND COLLECTION OF IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   The impact fees due for roadway facilities shall be collected at the
time of issuance of a building permit for any work on the subject property,
unless a development agreement between the developer and the city has been
executed providing for a different time or method of payment, whichever comes
first.
   (B)   For areas where water and wastewater capacity is available:
      (1)   The city shall collect all impact fees due at the time the city
issues a building permit; or
      (2)   For land platted outside the corporate boundaries of the city, the
city shall collect the fees for water or wastewater facilities at the time an
application for an individual meter connection to the city's water or
wastewater system is filed.
   (C)   If the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has
expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the impact fees due shall
be computed using the schedule then in effect, and previous payments of impact
fees shall be credited against the new fees due.
   (D)   The city shall calculate the impact fees due for the new development
in the following manner:
      (1)   The amount of each impact fee due shall be determined by
multiplying the number of service units generated by the new development by the
impact fee due per service unit for the service area using
Appendix A – Table of Water and Wastewater Service Unit Equivalencies. The
number of service units shall be determined according to §
158.007.
      (2)   The amount of each impact fee due shall be reduced by any allowable
credits for that category of capital improvements, in the manner provided in §
158.010.
   (E)   The amount of each impact fee due for a new development shall not
exceed an amount computed by multiplying the maximum impact fee per service
unit under
Appendix A – Table of Water and Wastewater Service Unit Equivalencies by the
number of service units generated by the development.
   (F)   Whenever the property owner proposes to increase the number of service
units for a development, the additional impact fees collected for such new
service units shall be determined by using the schedule then in effect and such
additional fee shall be collected either prior to or at the time of issuance of
a new building permit, or prior to or at the time of enlargement of the
connection to the city's water or wastewater system.
   (G)   Residential irrigation meter exemption. The payment of the water
impact fee shall not be required by an existing residential customer for the
installation of a meter to serve a separate lawn irrigation system provided all
of the following requirements are met:
      (1)   The lawn irrigation meter does not exceed the three-quarter inch by
five-eighths inch standard basic meter size;
      (2)   The lawn irrigation shall be located on the same property as the
residential meter;
      (3)   The residential property must be owner-occupied; and
      (4)   The lawn irrigation meter only serves the lawn irrigation system.
      (5)   The upgrade of a three-quarter inch by five-eighths inch lawn
irrigation meter to a one inch meter shall require payment of a water impact
fee based on the difference between the base meter size and the water impact
fee for a one inch meter.
      (6)   No exemption or pro-rata credit shall apply for any meter size
exceeding one inch for a lawn irrigation meter.
   (H)   On property that receives final plat approval before February 13,
2018, no impact fees shall be collected on any service unit for which a valid
building permit is issued on or before February 13, 2019. If a building permit
obtained within that period subsequently expires, and no new application is
made and approved within such period, the new development shall be subject to
the payment of impact fees. On property that receives final plat approval on or
after February 13, 2018, and before July 1, 2018, no impact fees shall be
collected on any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued
before July 1, 2018. If a building permit obtained within that period
subsequently expires, and no new application is made and approved within such
period, the new development shall be subject to the payment of impact fees.

   (A)   The city shall offset the present value of any system-related
facilities, pursuant to rules established in this section, which have been
dedicated to and have been received by the city, including the value of capital
improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city, against the
value of the impact fee due for that category of capital improvement.
   (B)   All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be subject to the
following limitations and shall be granted based on this chapter and additional
standards promulgated by the city, which may be adopted as administrative
guidelines.
      (1)   No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or
construction of site-related facilities.
      (2)   The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those
assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan
for the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee
is imposed.
      (3)   If an offset or credit applicable to a plat has not been exhausted
within ten years from the date of plat filing or within such period as may be
otherwise designated by contract, such offset or credit shall expire.
      (4)   The city will not reimburse the property owner or developer for an
offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected
pursuant to this chapter or for any value exceeding the total impact fees due
for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise
agreed to by the city.
   (C)   An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit
against impact fees due for the development either at or before the time of fee
payment, unless the city agrees to a different time. The applicant shall file a
petition for offsets or credits with the city. The city must provide the
applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset or credit request,
including the reasons for the decision. The decision shall specify the maximum
value of the offset or credit which may be applied against an impact fee, which
value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for

   (B)   Interest earned on the account into which the impact fees are
deposited shall be considered funds of the account and shall be used solely for
the purposes authorized in §
158.012.
   (C)   The city shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to
ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the
purposes authorized in this chapter. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized
by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes
and intent of these regulations; provided, however, that funds shall be
expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten years from
the date impact fees are deposited into the account.
   (D)   The City Finance Department shall maintain such records as are
necessary to ensure that refunds are appropriately made and such other
information as may be necessary for the proper implementation of this chapter.
   (E)   The city shall maintain and keep financial records for impact fees,
which shall show the source and disbursement of all fees collected in or

      (2)   Repair, operation, or maintenance of existing or new capital
improvements;
      (3)   Upgrade, expansion or replacement of existing capital improvements
to serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety, efficiency,
environmental or regulatory standards;
      (4)   Upgrade, expansion, or replacement of existing capital improvements
to provide better service to existing development; provided, however, that
impact fees may be used to pay the costs of upgrading, expanding or replacing
existing capital improvements in order to meet the need for new capital
improvements generated by new development; or
      (5)   Administrative and operating costs of the city.
(Ord. 05-2018-36, passed 5-8-18)
§ 158.013 APPEALS.
   (A)   The property owner or applicant for new development may appeal the
following decisions of the Director of Public Works to the City Council:
      (1)   The applicability of an impact fee to the development;
      (2)   The amount of the impact fee due;
      (3)   The availability of, the amount of, or the expiration of a credit;
      (4)   The application of a credit against an impact fee due;
      (5)   The amount of the impact fee in proportion to the benefit received
by the new development; or
      (6)   The amount of a refund due, if any.
   (B)   The appellant must file a written notice of appeal with the City
Secretary within 30 days following the Director of Public Work's decision. If
the notice of appeal is accompanied by a payment or other security satisfactory
to the City Attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the
impact fee due, the development application may be processed while the appeal
is pending.
   (C)   At the hearing, the City Council shall consider all relevant evidence
and shall allow testimony from the applicant, city staff and other interested
persons relevant to the appeal. The hearing may be continued from time to time.
   (D)   Following the hearing, the City Council shall consider all evidence
and determine whether the appeal should be granted (in whole or in part) or
denied.
   (E)   The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the
amount of the fee or the amount of the credit was not calculated according to
the applicable schedule of impact fees or the guidelines established for
determining credits. The applicant shall submit an engineering report prepared
by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such engineering
services in the State of Texas, which demonstrates that the applicant's burden
has been met.
(Ord. 05-2018-36, passed 5-8-18)
§ 158.014 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon application, any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant
to these regulations, which has not been expended within the service area
within ten years from the date of payment, shall be refunded to the record
owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid or, if the impact fee
was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together
with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at
the statutory rate as set forth in Tex. Finance Code § 302.002, or its
successor statute. The application for refund pursuant to this section shall be
submitted within 60 days after the expiration of the ten-year period for
expenditure of the fee. An impact fee shall be considered expended on a first-
in, first-out basis.
   (B)   An impact fee collected pursuant to these regulations shall also be
considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or
facility expansion authorized in §
158.012 within the service area within ten years following the date of payment
exceeds the total fees collected within the service area for such improvements
or expansions during such period.
   (C)   If a refund is due pursuant to divisions (A) or (B), the city shall
divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the
fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service
area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to
the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service
unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was
paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount.
   (D)   Upon completion of all the capital improvements or facility expansion
identified in the capital improvements plan for the service area, the city
shall recalculate the maximum impact fee per service unit using the actual
costs for the improvements or expansions. If the maximum impact fee per service
unit based on actual cost is less than the impact fee per service unit paid,
the city shall refund the difference, if such difference exceeds the impact fee
paid by more than 10%. If the difference is less than 10%, no refund shall be
due. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying such
difference by the number of service units for the development for which the fee
was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount.
   (E)   If a tract of land for which an impact fee has been paid is replatted,
resulting in a reduction in the number of service units, and the new impact fee
to be collected is less than that paid, the city shall refund the difference,
provided that water meters to serve the development have not been installed.
   (F)   No refunds or credits against impact fees due shall be given for
decreasing the number or size of water meters serving a development, except as
provided in division (E).
   (G)   A petition for a refund shall be submitted to the Director of Public
Works. Within one month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the
Director of Public Works must provide the petitioner, in writing, with a
decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision. If a
refund is due to the petitioner, the Director of Public Works shall notify the
Finance Director and request that a refund payment be made to the petitioner.
The petitioner may appeal the Director's determination to the Council, as set
forth in this chapter.

§ 158.015 REBATE.
   If the building permit for a new development for which an impact fee has
been paid has expired, no utility connections for that category of capital
improvements have been made to the development, and a modified or new
application has not been filed within six months of such expiration, the city
shall, upon written application, rebate the amount of the impact fee to the
record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid. If no
application for rebate pursuant to this subsection has been filed within this
period, no rebate shall become due.

in any successor statute.
   (B)   The city may review its land use assumptions, impact fees, capital
improvements plans and other factors such as market conditions more frequently
than provided in division (A) to determine whether the land use assumptions and
capital improvements plans should be updated and the impact fee recalculated
accordingly.

   (C)   The City Council may grant a variance from any requirement of this
chapter, upon written request by a developer or owner of property subject to
this chapter, following a public hearing, and only upon finding that a strict
application of such requirement would, when regarded as a whole, result in
confiscation of the property.
