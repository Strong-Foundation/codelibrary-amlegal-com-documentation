Section 10.01. Power of Initiative
   The people of the City reserve the power to direct legislation by initiative
and, in the exercise of such power, may propose any ordinance not in conflict
with this charter or state law, except an ordinance appropriating money or
authorizing the levy of taxes or an ordinance repealing an ordinance
appropriating money or levying taxes. Any initiated ordinance may be submitted
by a petition signed by registered voters of the city equal in number to at
least twenty (20) percent of the number of registered voters residing in the
city at the time of the last regular city election.
Section 10.02. Power of Referendum
   The people of the City reserve the power to approve or reject at the polls
any legislation enacted by the Council which is subject to the initiative
process under this Charter. Within thirty (30) days after the final adoption or
publication, whichever date is later, of any ordinance which is subject to
referendum, a petition, signed by registered voters of the city equal in number
to at least twenty (20) percent of the number of registered voters residing in
the City at the time of the last regular City election, may be filed with the
City Secretary requesting that any such ordinance be either repealed or
submitted to a vote of the people. When such a petition has been certified as
sufficient by the City Secretary, the ordinance so specified in the petition
shall not go into effect, or further action thereunder shall be suspended if it
shall have gone into effect, until and unless it is approved by the voters as
herein provided.
Section 10.03. Form of Petition for Initiative and Referendum
   All petition papers circulated for the purpose of an initiative or
referendum shall be uniform in size and style. Initiative petition papers shall
contain the full text of the proposed ordinance. The signatures to initiative
and referendum petitions need not all be appended to one paper, but to each
separate paper there shall be attached a statement of the circulator that he/
she personally circulated the foregoing paper, that all the signatures appended
thereto were made in his/her presence and that he/she believes them to be the
genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be. Each signer
of any such petition shall sign his/her name in ink, shall indicate after his/
her name his/her place of residence by street, street number and zip code, and
shall record the date of signature.

Section 10.04. Filing, Examination and Certification of Petitions
   All papers comprising a petition for initiative or referendum shall be
assembled and filed with the City Secretary as one instrument. Within thirty
(30) days after the petition is filed, the City Secretary shall determine
whether each paper of the petition has a proper statement of the circulator and
whether the petition has been signed by a sufficient number of qualified
electors and shall hold any petition paper entirely invalid which does not have
attached thereto the statement signed by the circulator thereof. The City
Secretary shall certify the result of this examination to the Council at its
next regular meeting. If the City Secretary shall certify that the petition is
insufficient, the certificate shall specify the particulars in which it is
defective and shall at once notify in writing the person filing the petition of
this finding. A petition may be amended at anytime within ten (10) days after a
notice of insufficiency has been sent by the City Secretary, by filing a
supplementary petition. In such event, the same procedures shall then be
followed by the City Secretary and Council as in the case of the original
petition for the same purpose.
Section 10.05. Council Consideration and Submission to Voters
   When the Council receives an authorized initiative petition, certified by
the City Secretary to be sufficient, the Council shall either (a) pass the
initiated ordinance without amendment within twenty (20) days after the date of
the certification to the Council; or (b) submit the initiated ordinance without
amendment to a vote of the qualified voters of the City at a regular or special
election to be held on a uniform election date of the state of Texas, but not
less than ninety (90) days from the date that the City Secretary certifies the
submission to the Council.
   When the Council receives an authorized referendum petition, certified by
the City Secretary to be sufficient, the Council shall reconsider the referred
ordinance. If, upon such reconsideration, such ordinance is not repealed, it
shall be submitted to the voters of the City at a regular or special election
to be held on a uniform election date of the state of Texas, but not less than
ninety (90) days from the date that the City Secretary certifies the submission
to the Council.
   Special elections on initiated or referred ordinances shall not be held more
frequently than once each six (6) months, and no ordinance on the same subject
as an initiated ordinance which has been defeated at any election may be
initiated by the voters within two (2) years from the date of such election.
Section 10.06. Ballot Form and Results of Election
   Ordinances submitted to the electors in accordance with the initiative and
referendum provisions of this Charter shall be submitted by ballot title which
shall contain a clear, concise statement, without argument, of the substance of
such ordinance. The ballot used shall have below the ballot title the following
proposition, one above the other in the order indicated: "FOR THE ORDINANCE"
and "AGAINST THE ORDINANCE." Any number of ordinances may be voted on at the
same election and may be submitted on the same ballot.
   If a majority of electors voting on a proposed initiated ordinance shall
vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon become an ordinance of the City. A
referred ordinance which is not approved by a majority of the electors voting
thereon shall thereupon be deemed repealed. If conflicting ordinances are
approved by the electors at the same election, the one receiving the greatest
number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.
Section 10.07. Power of Recall
   The people of the City reserve the power to recall the Mayor or any other
member of the Council and may exercise such power by filing with the City
Secretary a petition, signed by qualified voters of the City equal in number to
at least twenty (20) percent of the number of registered voters residing in the
City at the time of the last regular municipal election of the City demanding
the removal of the Mayor or other member of the Council. The petition shall be
signed and verified in the manner required for an initiative petition, shall
contain a general statement of the grounds upon which the removal is sought and
one of the signers of each petition paper shall make an affidavit that the
statements made therein are true.
(Am. Ord. 11-0719, passed 7-19-2011)
Section 10.08. Recall Election
   All papers comprising a recall petition shall be assembled and filed with
the City Secretary. Within thirty (30) days after the petition is filed, the
City Secretary shall determine its sufficiency and, if found to be sufficient,
shall certify this fact to the Council at its next regular meeting. If a recall
petition is found to be insufficient, it may be amended within ten (10) days
after notice of such insufficiency by the City Secretary, by filing a
supplementary petition. In that event, the same procedures shall then be
followed by the City Secretary and the Council as in the case of an original
petition. The finding of insufficiency of a recall petition shall not prejudice
the filing of a new petition for the same purpose.
   The Council Member whose removal is sought by a recall petition may, within
five (5) days after such petition has been certified and presented to the
Council, request in writing that a public hearing be held to permit him/her to
present facts pertinent to the charges specified in the petition. In this
event, the Council shall order such public hearing to be held not less than
five (5) days nor more than fifteen (15) days after receiving such request for
a public hearing.
   If the Council Member whose removal is sought does not resign, the Council
shall order a recall election and fix a date for such election, the date of
which shall not be less than ninety (90) days from the date the petition was
submitted to the Council or from the date of the public hearing if one was
held, whichever is later, or at the earliest date thereafter permitted by the
state election code.
Section 10.09. Recall Ballot
   Ballots used in recall elections shall read as follows: "SHALL (name of
person or persons) BE REMOVED FROM THE CITY COUNCIL BY RECALL?" Below such
question there shall be printed the following as to each person named:
"FOR THE REMOVAL OF (name of person.)" "AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF (name of
person.)"
Section 10.10. Results of a Recall Election
   If a majority of the votes cast at a recall election shall be against
removal of a Council Member named on the ballot, that member shall continue in
office. If a majority of the votes cast at such election be for the removal of
the Council Member named on the ballot, the Council shall immediately declare
the office vacant and such vacancy shall be filled in accordance with the
provisions of this Charter. A Council Member thus removed shall not be a
candidate to succeed himself/herself in an election called to fill the vacancy
created.
Section 10.11. Limitations on Recall
   No recall petition shall be filed against the Mayor or any other Council
Member within six (6) months after he/she first takes office, nor within six
(6) months after an election for his/her recall, nor within six (6) months of
the end of his/her term.

of injury resulting in death, the person or persons claiming damage shall
within six (6) months after the death of the injured person give notice as
required above. Failure to notify the City of such a claim within six (6)
months from the date of the claim shall exonerate, exempt and excuse the City

or otherwise, which are provided under common law and state law.

recognize any assignment of wages or funds by its employees, agents or
contractors except by court order or as otherwise required by state law.
Section 13.07. References to State Law

provided otherwise, such reference shall mean state law currently in effect and
shall not be limited to state law as it existed at the time of adoption of this
Charter, or any relevant portion hereof.
Section 13.08. Separability
   If any section or part of this Charter is held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall
not invalidate or impair the validity, force or effect of any other section or
part of a section of this Charter.

amendments to the Charter as may seem necessary for legal, administrative or
other reasons.
ARTICLE XIV. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
Section 14.01. Effect of Charter on Existing Officers and Employees
   Nothing in this Charter except as otherwise specifically provided shall
affect or impair the rights or privileges of persons who are City officers or
employees at the time of its adoption.
   From and after the date of adoption of this Charter, the persons then
filling elective offices that are retained under this Charter will continue to
fill those offices for the terms to which they were elected.
   Persons, who on the date this Charter is adopted are filling appointive
positions with the City, which are retained under this Charter, shall continue

   Any ordinances, rules or regulations inconsistent with this Charter are
repealed as of the date of adoption of the Charter.
Section 14.03. Submission of Charter to Election
   The Charter Commission, in preparing this Charter, finds and declares that
it is impracticable to segregate each subject so that the voter may vote "yes"
or "no" on the same, for the reason that the Charter is so constructed that in
order to enable it to properly function it is necessary that it should be
adopted in its entirety. For this reason, the Charter Commission directs that
this Charter be voted upon as a whole, and that it shall be submitted to the
qualified voters of the City at an election to be held on the tenth day of May,
2008. If this Charter is approved by a majority of the qualified voters, voting
at this election, it shall become the Charter of the City of Willis on the date
the Council enters an order in the records of the City declaring that the
Charter is adopted.

have not signed. In the event the requested abandonment or alteration pertains
to or involves an easement, the applicant must acquire written approval with no
objections documented from each utility providing service in the city. In any
case where alteration or abandonment of easement(s) is requested, if approved,
all costs associated with the relocation or alteration of any utilities shall
be borne by the person making the request (applicant).

property owners.
   (D)   In the event the application requests that on a portion of a through
street, alley, easement or public way open to public access from either
direction is to be abandoned, altered, closed, or vacated, then it shall be
necessary for the applicant to provide the City Secretary with the names and
last known mailing addresses of all abutting property owners, both for the
portion to be closed and for that portion to remain open in either direction up
to the next intersection with another street, alley, or public way. Notices and
release forms will be mailed to all the abutting property owners for the closed
and open portions of the street, alley, or public way as provided in division
(C) above.
   (E)   The proposed action by the City Council shall be placed on the agenda
for the next public meeting of the City Council after the completed application
has been processed, provided that there are at least ten days between the date

City Council meeting. The City Council shall not act on the application until
the City Secretary has received an executed release form from each of the
abutting property owners listed in the petition and the completed application.
   (F)   The City Council may, in its discretion, require a public hearing
before the application is considered. In such event, notice of the hearing
shall be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city
at least 15 days before the hearing, and posted for 15 days before the hearing
at the City Hall.
   (G)   The application, if not acted upon at the first public meeting at
which it appears on the agenda, may be continued on the agenda to subsequent
public meetings if it is in the best interest of the parties and the public as
the City Council may, in its sole discretion, determine.
   (H)   The City Council may elect to retain its fee simple ownership of any
closed or abandoned street, alley, easement, or public right-of-way.

City Council may sell the property to all abutting property owners in an
equitable manner as provided by Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, § 272.001(c), by either
determining the appraised fair market value of the property, or by selling the
property at a public auction with two separate dates of publication as provided
by Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, § 272.001(a). The notice must include a description of
the property to be sold and its location.
   (J)   Nothing in this section should be construed as preventing the City
Council from abandoning, closing, altering, or vacating a street, alley,
easement, or other public right-of-way on its own initiative without the need
for submission of an application by abutting property owners.

(Ord. 03-0617, passed 6-17-2003) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.04 AUTOMATIC DISHWASHER DISCHARGES.
   Automatic dishwashers shall not discharge directly to a grease interceptor
unless the interceptor is designed to accept hot water discharges from
dishwashers and the interceptor is properly sized to allow sufficient detention
time to allow cooling to prevent interference of the interceptor operation.
(Ord. 03-0617, passed 6-17-2003) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.05 INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Grease traps are interceptors designed to capture separable fats,
oils, and greases generated in food service facilities. The user of a grease
trap must service interceptors from 50 gallons or less at 15-day intervals;
interceptors above 50 gallons up to and including 750 gallons every 30 days;
and interceptors larger than 750 gallons no less than every 90 days with a
schedule that includes: pumping of the entire contents of the tank; cleaning
the walls of the tank; inspecting the inlet and outlet piping; and the
integrity of the baffles. In no case shall the maintenance schedule be less
than one servicing every three months without written approval of the City Code
Enforcement Officer.
   (B)   Grit traps are interceptors designed to capture sand and grit. Grit
traps are usually used in car washes and automotive and machinery repair shops.
Grit traps may be included in oil/water separators. The grit trap user is
required to establish a maintenance schedule that includes the removal of all
sand, gravel, grit, and oil from the interceptor. In no case shall the
maintenance schedule be less than twice per year without written approval of
the City Code Enforcement Officer.
   (C)   Oil/water separators are interceptors designed to separate petroleum-
based oils from the wastewater. Oil/water separators are usually used in car
washes and automotive and machinery repair shops. The oil/water separator user
is required to establish an appropriate maintenance schedule that includes the
removal of all fluids and sludge from the separator. In no case shall the
maintenance schedule be less than twice per year without written approval of
the City Code Enforcement Officer.
   (D)   Lint traps are interceptors designed to separate textile lint from the
wastewater. Lint traps are usually used in laundries. Lint traps are usually
manually cleaned by the business operator. Lint trap users must establish an
appropriate maintenance schedule that removes the trapped lint to prevent sewer
backups.
   (E)   Users of traps designed to remove fats, oils, grease, grit or
petroleum-based oils will be accessed a fee to offset the cost of maintaining
the data and enforcement. The fee is found in §
155.073. The fee may be collected through the water billing department at a
rate of 12 equal payments throughout the year.
(Ord. 03-0617, passed 6-17-2003; Ord. 23-0321A, passed 3-21-2023) Penalty, see
§
52.99
§ 52.06 AUTHORITY TO REGULATE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES.
   (A)   The City Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to conduct inspections
of the interceptor, the grounds, and facilities generating the discharge
received by the interceptor. Interceptors which are located in parking lots or
other areas where vehicles may reasonably be expected to be parked must be
protected by a permanent barrier, railing, or other means, at the owner's
expense, if it is determined necessary by the Pretreatment Department to ensure
continued and uninterrupted access to the interceptor.
   (B)   If at any time as the result of an inspection, the Code Enforcement
Officer determines that the condition of an interceptor is such that it has the
potential to adversely affect the sewer system, the Code Enforcement Officer is
authorized to establish minimum interceptor maintenance schedules; mandatory
interceptor maintenance; require pumping within a specified period of time; or
halt all discharges to the interceptor until maintenance can be performed.
(Ord. 03-0617, passed 6-17-2003)
§ 52.07 TRANSPORT MANIFESTS.
   Service companies performing interceptor pumping and cleaning are required
by state law to manifest every load using a state-approved manifest form. The
city requires that the interceptor user or the service company electronically
forward a copy of the manifest or the required data to the city or their
appointed data-base holder within three days of service. The interceptor user
must retain a copy of the manifest, on-site, for inspection by the city for a
period of three years from the date of origin.

§ 52.08 SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS.
   Sanitary sewer overflows are defined as the release of wastewater from the
sanitary sewers to the environment. This may be the backup and overflow from
the sewer to the streets or surroundings; or a sewer backup in a business or
home. Interceptor users that do not properly maintain their interceptors may be
held responsible for damages resulting from sanitary sewer overflows attributed
to blockage of flow in the sewer lines as a result of excess fat, oil, grease,
grit, or lint from a user's facilities.
(Ord. 03-0617, passed 6-17-2003)
§ 52.09 RESTRICTIONS TO SANITARY SEWER FLOWS.
   Improper maintenance of interceptors usually results in the release of
excess quantities of grease and oil to the sewer lines resulting in a gradual
buildup of solids restricting flow. Interceptor users may be responsible for
costs associated with cleaning sewer lines impacted by excess grease and oil
buildup in the sewer lines.
(Ord. 03-0617, passed 6-17-2003)
§ 52.10 DISPOSAL OF INTERCEPTOR WASTES.
   Storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of all wastes from
interceptors shall be performed in accordance with applicable federal, state,
and local regulations that pertain to the type and/or class of waste. Materials
removed from waste interceptors must be disposed of at legally designated
locations for those specific type wastes. Failure to dispose of waste properly
may result in civil action by the city.
(Ord. 03-0617, passed 6-17-2003) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.11 PERFORMANCE BONDS.
   The city may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to
any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this subchapter, a
previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other

pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise
be incompatible with the POTW;
      (3)   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and
sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the
POTW;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW; and
      (6)   To enable the city to comply with its national pollutant discharge
elimination system permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is
subject.
   (C)   Authority. This chapter provides that all connections of lateral or
other sewer lines to the sewerage system of the POTW service area, whether
within or without the city, shall be made subject to such terms and conditions
as the Willis Director of Public Works may prescribe; and for the regulation of
authorized contributors to the city's wastewater facilities through the
issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users and the enforcement of
general requirements, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities,
requires user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (D)   Applicability. This chapter shall apply to all non-domestic users of
the city's wastewater facilities, whether such users are located within or
outside the city boundaries.
   (E)   Administration. This chapter shall supersede the city Ordinance No.
03-0822 adopted by the city on August 22, 2003; except as otherwise provided
herein, the city Public Works Department or its designee shall administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

in the POTW resulting in interference. In no case shall solids greater than
half inches in any dimension be discharged to the POTW;
      (5)   Wastewater having a pH of less than 5.5 or higher than 9.5 or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;
      (6)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems;
      (7)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater
either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a
public nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for
maintenance and repair;
      (8)   Wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the wastewater treatment plant or results in interference with the
operations of the facility, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the
control manhole which exceeds 150°F (65°C) or which causes the temperature of
the waste at the entrance to the wastewater treatment plant to exceed 104°F
(40°C). In addition, no wastewater with such a temperature that will cause the
temperature of the wastewater at the entrance to the wastewater treatment plant
to rise more than 10°F per hour;
      (9)   Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the POTW;
      (10)   Wastewater containing fats, oils, or greases of animal or

      (14)   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes, unless authorized under wastewater discharge permit issued
by the city, in accordance with §
53.155 of this chapter;
      (15)   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the POTW's effluent to fail a toxicity test; a violation of the city's NPDES
permit; or cause a sanitary sewer overflow;
      (16)   Wastewater containing detergents, surface active agents, or other
substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW;
      (17)   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
POTW, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions;
      (18)   Medical wastes, unless authorized under a wastewater discharge
permit issued by the city, in accordance with §
53.155 of this chapter.
   (B)   Storage and process area drains. Wastes prohibited by this section
shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged
to the POTW. All floor drains located in process or material storage areas
where prohibited wastes are present must discharge to the industrial user's
pretreatment facility before connecting with the POTW or contained for
collection and disposal by means other than discharge to the POTW.
   (C)   Local limits. The following pollutant limits are established to
protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge
wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the maximum daily concentration
limits listed in Table I of this section. The city may impose mass limitations
and/or BMP/P3s in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based
limitation of Table I. These limits apply at the "end-of-pipe" defined as the
point where the wastewater enters the city's sewer collection system. All
concentrations for metallic substances are for "Total Metals" unless indicated
otherwise. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a
local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable
pretreatment standard shall apply.
Table I. Local Limits
Pollutants (Total Metals) Symbol Maximum Daily Concentration (mg/1)
Table I. Local Limits
Pollutants (Total Metals) Symbol Maximum Daily Concentration (mg/1)
Arsenic                   As     0.6
Cadmium                   Cd     0.08
Chromium                  Cr     4.9

Note*   Industrial user permit compliance/noncompliance determinations will be
based on the minimum analytical level (MAL) for mercury. Effluent
concentrations measured as less than the MAL are deemed to be compliant with
the permit limit for mercury. When an analysis of an effluent sample for
mercury results in a measurement of less than the MAL, then the parameter
shall be reported as less than the MAL value (<MAL) and this shall be
interpreted as a value of zero for compliance purposes.
 
   (D)   Dilution.
      (1)   No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water or,
in any other way; attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment
standard, a discharge permit, or this chapter.
      (2)   The pretreatment department may impose mass limitations on
industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
   (E)   Federal categorical pretreatment standards. The national categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471
are hereby incorporated.
      (1)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
city may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40
CFR 403.6(c).
      (2)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city shall impose
an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      (3)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
      (4)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   (F)   State pretreatment standards. The Texas Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (TPDES) adopts 40 CFR 403 by reference under 30 TAC Chapter
315 as authorized under V.T.C.A., Water Code § 26.047. The Texas Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System Pretreatment rules, specified in 30 TAC Chapter
315 are hereby incorporated.
   (G)   City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in §
53.151 of this chapter or the general and specific prohibitions in §
53.153 of this chapter.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.154 AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE PRETREATMENT.
   (A)   Authority to halt or prevent discharges. The city shall have authority
to halt or prevent any discharge to the POTW which reasonably appears to
present an imminent endangerment to human health or welfare, an endangerment to
the environment, or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW.
   (B)   Authority to condition or deny discharges. The city may condition or
deny new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of
pollutants to the POTW by industrial users where such contributions do not meet
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (C)   Authority to require pollution prevention and/or best management
practices programs. The city shall have authority to require any user to
develop and implement pollution prevention programs and/or best management
practices (BMPs) programs designed to reduce or control discharges to meet
pretreatment standards established under this chapter or to reduce the
pollutant loading on the POTW.
   (D)   Promulgation of new federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon
the promulgation of federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular
industrial subcategory, such Federal standards, if more stringent than
limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall
immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The
Pretreatment Department shall notify all affected users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.155 INDUSTRIAL USER WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Local limits and applicable national pretreatment standards shall
be enforced through individual industrial user permits. Any violation of the
wastewater discharge permit, including Best Management Practices (BMPs) and/or
Pollution Prevention Plans (P3s) used as an alternative to local limit(s)shall
be deemed a violation of this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit
does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and
state rules and regulations.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for significant industrial users to discharge
wastewater, either directly or indirectly, into the city's sanitary sewer
system without first obtaining an industrial user's permit. Existing permitted
industrial users must apply for a modification to their permit if there is a
change in the permittee's contribution to the city sewage system.
      (3)   The pretreatment department may require other industrial users to
obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   (B)   Wastewater discharge permitting extra jurisdictional industrial users.
      (1)   Any existing significant industrial user located beyond the city
limits shall submit a wastewater discharge permit application within 90 days
prior to any proposed discharge into the POTW.
      (2)   Alternately, the city may enter into an agreement with the
neighboring jurisdiction in which the significant industrial user is located to
provide for the implementation and enforcement of pretreatment program
requirements against said industrial user.
   (C)   Wastewater survey. When requested by the pretreatment coordinator, a
user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of their
wastewater by completing a wastewater survey within 45 days of the request. The
pretreatment coordinator is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and
may periodically require industrial users to update the survey. Failure to
complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the
user and shall be considered a violation of this chapter.
   (D)   Permit application.
      (1)   Existing users. Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge
permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date
of this chapter and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future,
shall, within 90 days after said date apply to the pretreatment coordinator for
a wastewater discharge permit, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the
POTW to continue after 180 days of the effective date of this chapter, except
in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the city. Wastewater
discharge permits issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall
remain in full force and effect until modified by the city to comply with the
new ordinance or the expiration date of the permit, which term is shortest.
      (2)   New source. Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge
permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must
obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An
application for this wastewater discharge permit, in accordance with §
53.155(D)(3) of this chapter, must be filed at least 90 days prior to the date
upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
      (3)   Wastewater discharge permit application contents. All users
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit
application. The pretreatment coordinator may require all users to submit as
part of an application the following information:
         (a)   Identifying information: business name, owner name, mailing
address, physical location of business, contact persons, etc;
         (b)   Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on
the premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or
stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be
discharged to the POTW;
         (c)   Number and type of employees, hours of operation, and proposed
or actual hours of operation;
         (d)   Each product produced by type, amount, process or processes, and
rate of production;
         (e)   Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum
per day);
         (f)   Site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and
details to show all sewers, floor drains, and appurtenances by size location,
and elevation, and all points of discharge;
         (g)   Time and duration of discharges;
         (h)   A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility;
         (i)   Actual operational data if an existing user or best estimates
based on other similar facilities; and
         (j)   Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the
pretreatment coordinator to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit
application.
      (4)   Application signatories and certification. All wastewater discharge
permit applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized
representative of the user and contain the following certification statement:
      “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility offline
and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
      (5)   The pretreatment department will evaluate the data furnished by the
user and may require additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of
the data furnished, the pretreatment department may issue an industrial user
wastewater discharge permit subject to such terms and conditions as deemed
reasonable and necessary. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be
processed and will be returned to the industrial user for revision.
   (E)   Permit duration. Industrial user discharge permits will be issued for
a specified time period not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a
period less than five years at the discretion of the pretreatment department.
   (F)   Permit renewal. Industrial users shall apply for renewal of permits at
least 90 days prior to the expiration of the existing permit. Provided that
such application has been filed in a timely manner, the terms and conditions of
the permit shall continue in full force and effect until a new permit has been
issued or denied.
   (G)   Permit modification.
      (1)   The permit may be modified for good cause including, but not
limited to, the following:
         (a)   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
         (b)   Material, substantial alterations, additions to the discharger's
operation processes, discharge volume, or characteristics of the wastewater
which were not considered in drafting the effective permit;
         (c)   A change in any condition, in either the industrial user or the
POTW, that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of
the authorized discharge;
         (d)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses threat
to the city's collection and treatment systems, POTW personnel, or the
receiving waters;
         (e)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit;
         (f)   Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant
facts in the permit application or in any required reporting;

         (i)   Transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new
owner/operator; or
         (j)   Upon request of the permittee (provided such request does not
create a violation of any applicable requirements) standards, laws, rules, or
regulations.
      (2)   Industrial users shall be informed of any changes in their permits
in a timely manner. Changed or new conditions in a permit shall include a
reasonable time for compliance.
      (3)   The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification,
revocation, renewal, or termination, or a notification of planned changes or
anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any permit condition.
   (H)   Permit conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this chapter, and all other applicable
regulations, user charges, and fees established by the city. Permits will
contain, but not be limited to, the following items applicable to this chapter
and other pretreatment regulations:
      (1)   Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics based on applicable general pretreatment standards in 40 CFR
403 of the Code of Federal Regulations, categorical pretreatment standards,

      (11)   A statement that compliance with the permit does not relieve the
permittee of the responsibility for compliance with all applicable federal
pretreatment standards, including those which become effective during the term
of the permit;
      (12)   A statement of duration, which in no event shall exceed five
years;
      (13)   A statement of non-transferability without the prior approval of
the POTW and provision for a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new
owner or operator;
      (14)   Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and record
keeping requirements, including identification of the pollutants to be

   (I)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be
reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner, new user, different location,
or a new or changed operation without the prior written approval of the city.
Notification to the city must include a written certification by the new owner
and/or operator which:
      (1)   States that the new owner and/or operator have no immediate intent
to change the facility's operations and processes.
      (2)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur.
      (3)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
   (J)   Permit appeals.
      (1)   An industrial user may appeal the denial or the requirements of the
discharge permit by writing the Director of Public Works within 30 days of
notice of denial or receipt of the permit. Failure to submit a timely petition
for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. The
appealing party must indicate the permit provisions objected to, the reasons
for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to be
placed in the permit. The effectiveness of the permit shall not be stayed
pending reconsideration by the city. If, after considering the petition and any
arguments presented by the pretreatment coordinator Chief Plant Operator or
Superintendent, the Director of Public Works determines that reconsideration is
proper, it shall remand the permit back to the pretreatment department for
renewal in conformity with the determination of the Director of Public Works.
Those permit provisions being reconsidered by the pretreatment department shall
be stayed pending renewal. In the event of permit denial, a request for
reconsideration submitted to the Director of Public Works shall be sufficient
to initiate the appeal process.
      (2)   The city's decision not to reconsider a final permit shall be
considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review.
Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final city action must do so
by filing a complaint with the District Court of Montgomery County, Texas
within 30 days.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.156 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment facilities. Industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve
compliance with all prohibitions, local limits and the categorical pretreatment
standards set out in § 53.153 within the time limitations specified by the EPA,
the state, or the city, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary
for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial
user's expense. Detailed plans describing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator for
review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the
facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility
as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require industrial users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The city may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
      (4)   Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require industrial users to
develop and implement pollution prevention programs designed to maintain
compliance to the city ordinances and industrial user wastewater permits. The
city may require the industrial user to perform a pollution prevention audit to
identify the potential benefits of a pollution prevention program.
      (5)   Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require industrial users to
develop and implement best management practices designed to maintain compliance
to the city ordinances and industrial user wastewater permits.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.157 SLUG DISCHARGE PREVENTION.
   (A)   Slug discharge control plans. The city shall evaluate, within one year
of being designated as a significant industrial user and at least once each
permit cycle to determine whether each such significant industrial user needs a
plan or other action to control slug discharges. For the purpose of this
section, a slug discharge is any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature,
including but not limited to an accidental spill or a non-customary batch
discharge. If the POTW determines that a slug control plan is needed, the plan
shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
      (1)   A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   A description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate any prohibition specified in §
53.153 of this chapter, with procedures for follow-up written notification
within five days;
      (4)   If necessary, procedures to prevent an adverse impact from
accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control
of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including
solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
   (B)   Notification of slug discharges.
      (1)   In the case of a slug discharge, it is the responsibility of the
user to immediately notify the city's Chief Plant Operator, pretreatment
coordinator, or Director of Public Works of the incident and provide the
following information: location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of
waste, concentration volume, and corrective actions.
      (2)   Within five days following a slug discharge, the user shall submit
to the pretreatment department a detailed written report describing the cause
of the discharge, the impact on the user's compliance status, the duration of
the discharge (including exact dates and times), and if not corrected, the
anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue, the type,
concentration, and volume of waste discharged, and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the city's wastewater facilities, fish kills,
or any other damage to persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve
the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liabilities which may be
imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
      (3)   The POTW will keep all records of the activities associated with
slug control evaluations and results of such activities will be available to
the Approval Authority upon request.
   (C)   Cost and clean-up. Any related costs, including fines, fees or court
costs, involved in the cleaning up of a slug discharge shall be paid by the
industrial user causing such discharge. This shall include the costs of
cleaning up the city's wastewater facilities, and the costs shall include any
labor, equipment, or materials involved. The cleaning up of the city's
wastewater facilities shall be completed by the city's operators or other
contractors approved by the city.
   (D)   Notification of changes. All industrial users shall promptly notify
the Pretreatment Department in advance of any substantial change not already
addressed in their slug control plan or other slug control requirements, which
may affect the potential for a slug discharge.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.158 TENANT RESPONSIBILITY.
   Where an owner of property leases premises to any other person as a tenant
under any rental or lease agreement, if either the owner or the tenant is an
industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.159 VANDALISM.
   No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage,
destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any structure,
appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the sanitary sewer or POTW.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.160 TOXIC ORGANIC MANAGEMENT PLAN (TOMP).
   (A)   Authority to require a TOMP. The city may require an industrial user
to prepare a toxic organic management plan that meets city approval.
   (B)   Failure to implement TOMP. Failure to administer the approved plan
will be in violation of the terms of this chapter and may result in termination
of an industrial user's permit.
   (C)   TOMP development steps. Industrial users may be required to implement
either or both of the following steps and report the results to the city prior
to preparation of a TOMP.
      (1)   Process engineering analysis. A process engineering analysis to
determine the source and types of toxic organic compounds found in the
facility's wastewater discharge, including sources and compounds that could
reasonably be expected to enter the wastewater in the event of spills, leaks,
etc., based on the type of operations conducted. Such an analysis should be
based on the results of one or more analyses of the plant's wastewater for
toxic organic pollutants. The process engineering analysis should include:
         (a)   An examination of published reports on the specific industry;
         (b)   A water flow diagram to identify all possible wastewater
sources;
         (c)   A list of raw materials used in the industrial processes,
including chemical additives, water treatment chemicals and cleaning agents,
and the wastewater stream that each regulated toxic organic could potentially
enter;
         (d)   A comparison of the toxins found in the effluent with the list
of raw materials and selection of the most probable wastewater source(s) of
toxic organic pollutants;
         (e)   An evaluation of the toxins found in the effluent, but not on
the raw materials list, and a determination of those formed as reaction
products or by-products;
         (f)   An examination of sources such as equipment corrosion or raw
materials' impurities that could result in release to wastewaters of toxic
organic pollutants.
      (2)   Pollutant control evaluation. An evaluation of the control options
that could be implemented to eliminate the toxic compound(s) or the sources or
potential sources of toxic organic compounds introduction to the treatment
system. This may include in-plant modifications, solvent or chemical
substitution, partial or complete recycle, reuse, neutralization, and operation
changes. The analysis should be conducted on a case-by case basis for each
source or potential source of toxic pollutant discharge. Also, an evaluation of
the available control options and the advantages and disadvantages of each must
be conducted.
   (D)   Preparation of toxic organic management plan. The city may require
that a toxic organic management plan include, but not be limited to, the
following:
      (1)   A complete inventory of all toxic organic chemicals in use or
identified through sampling and analysis of the wastewater from process
operations (regulated and/or unregulated). Organic constituents of trade-name
products should be obtained from the appropriate suppliers as necessary;
      (2)   Descriptions of the methods of disposal other than dumping used for
the inventoried compounds, such as reclamation, contract hauling, or
incineration;
      (3)   The procedures for ensuring that the regulated toxic organic
pollutants do not spill or routinely leak into process wastewaters, floor
drains, non-contact cooling water, groundwater, storm sewer, surface waters
(same as an accidental discharge and spill prevention plan), or any other
location which allows discharge of the compounds;
      (4)   Determinations or best estimates of the identities and approximate
quantities of toxic organic pollutants used as well as discharged from the
regulated and/or unregulated processes;
      (5)   A description of how employees will be trained in the proper
handling, disposal, and clean-up of toxic organics; and
      (6)   A statement concerning the facilities and frequencies at which
inspections which will be conducted, and whom they will be conducted by, to
insure proper management of toxic organics.
   (E)   Certification statement. The following certification statement must be
submitted by industrial users at the time of submission of a toxic organic
management plan and with each subsequent self monitoring report:
“Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the TTO limitations, I certify that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, no dumping of concentrated toxic organics into the
wastewaters has occurred since filing of the last report. I further certify
that this facility is implementing the toxic organic pollutant management plan
submitted to the City of Willis.”
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.161 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Inspection.
      (1)   The city shall be allowed to inspect any facilities, equipment,
practices, or operations which are associated with the industrial users
discharge into the POTW to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and
any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial
user is complying with all requirements thereof. The city shall be allowed to
have access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any
additional duties. All records must be kept in accordance with the conditions
of the users discharge permit.
      (2)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification personnel from the city,
state, and/or EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
      (3)   The city shall conduct a minimum of one inspection per year at each
permitted SIU.
   (B)   Retention of records. Permitted industrial users shall retain and make
available for copying, all records and information required to be retained
under this chapter. These records shall be retained at their premises for a
period of at least three years from the date such samples were taken. The
Pretreatment Department will maintain records of all information resulting from
any monitoring activities required by 40 CFR Part 403 including documentation
associated with Best Management Practices (BMP). Record keeping requirements
outlined in 40 CFR 403.12 (o)(l-3) must be followed.
   (C)   Sampling.
      (1)   The pretreatment department is authorized to require representative
samples of wastewater discharges from Industrial Users as often as necessary to
adequately monitor and control their discharge. In the event the pretreatment
department requires such samples, a user shall retain the services of a
reputable commercial laboratory and pay all costs of sample collection and
laboratory services to determine and report the wastewater characteristics.
      (2)   The city shall sample and analyze the effluent from significant
industrial users at least once a year. Samples may be randomly collected at
users' facilities by the city or its authorized representative. Any sample
collected by the city or its authorized representative that indicates a
violation must be sampled again within thirty days. The cost of such sampling
and laboratory analyses shall be paid by the industrial users.
      (3)   All handling and preservation of collected samples and laboratory
analyses of samples shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by
using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and
analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other
persons approved by the EPA.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the
pretreatment department and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the industrial user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the
industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (D)   Determination of noncompliance. The city may use a grab sample(s) to
determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.162 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   Self-reporting requirements.
      (1)   To demonstrate continued compliance, significant non-categorical
industrial users shall submit to the pretreatment department a description of
the nature, concentration, and flow of pollutants in their discharge, at the
frequency specified in industrial users discharge permit, with the minimum
frequency being once every six months. The reports shall be based on sampling
and analysis performed during the period covered by the report and performed in
accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments
thereto.
      (2)   This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of
the significant non-categorical industrial user. Where the city itself collects
all the information required for the report, the non-categorical significant
industrial user will not be required to submit the report; however, the
significant non-categorical industrial user must reimburse the city for its
cost of sampling and analysis.
      (3)   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the CA or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
   (B)   Self-reporting requirements for categorical industrial users.
      (1)   All categorical industrial users must comply with 40 CFR Section
403.12(b) and (d) regarding submission of baseline reports and 90-day
compliance reports.
      (2)   To demonstrate continued compliance, categorical industrial users
shall submit to the pretreatment department a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in their effluent which are limited by categorical
pretreatment standards, a record of measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period, a description of the nature,
concentration, and flow of the pollutants in their discharge, and production
data in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(e)(3) and (g)(4) as part of the
categorical standard. These reports are due during the months of June and
December, unless more frequent reporting, or specific semiannual reporting
dates are specified in the industrial users discharge permit. The reports shall
be based on sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the
report and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part
136 and amendments thereto.
      (3)   If a user is classified as a non-classified categorical (NSCIU) per
40 CFR 403.3 (v)(2) then such user shall annually submit the required
certification in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(q).
   (C)   Noncompliance reporting requirements. If sampling performed by an
industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the Pretreatment
Department within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results to the
Pretreatment Department within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
Re-sampling is not required if the city performs sampling at the industrial
users' facility at a frequency of at least once per month or if the city
conducted monitoring between the time the sample was collected, indicating the
violation, and the time the analytical results were received by the city.
   (D)   Extra sampling data from significant industrial users. If a
significant industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the city, using the procedures specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto, the results shall be included in the industrial users self-
monitoring report.
   (E)   Signatory and certification requirements. All reports must be signed
by an authorized representative of the industrial users' respective industry as
defined by CFR 403.12(1) and certified using the certification statement
specified in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and any other certification statements
required by the city.
   (F)   Fraud and false statements. The reports and other documents required
of the industrial users are subject to the provisions of 18 USC 1001 relating
to fraud and false statements and the provisions of Section 309(c)(4) of the
act, as amended, governing false statements, representation, or certification
in reports required under the Act and the provisions of Section 309(c)(6)
regarding responsible corporate officers.
   (G)   Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall promptly
notify the pretreatment department in advance of any substantial change in the
volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
   (H)   Notification of potential problems. All industrial users shall notify
the Pretreatment Department immediately of all discharges and/or slug loads
that could cause problems to the POTW.
   (I)   Timing.
      (1)   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
post-marked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern.
      (2)   Due dates falling on a weekend will be due the following Monday.
Reports due on a holiday will be due on the day following the holiday.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.163 HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   User notification to POTW of hazardous waste discharges. Industrial
users shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division
director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge
into the POTW of a substance which is not identified in the self-monitoring
requirements of the industrial discharge permit, and, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the industrial user:
      (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
      (2)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and
      (3)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
   (B)   Reporting period for hazardous waste notification. All notifications
must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this chapter.
Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this
chapter shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the
discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification
under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged.
   (C)   Discharger exemptions. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of
divisions (A)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they
discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are
acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge
of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
   (D)   Subsequent notifications. Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.
   (E)   Notification as a result of changes to regulations. In the case of any
new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a
hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, and the EPA regional
waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities
of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (F)   Program certification. In addition to the above notification
requirements, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place
to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree
it has determined to be economically practical.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.164 FEES.
   In addition to the wastewater service charges made by the city, all
customers of the city that discharge industrial wastewater into the POTW shall
pay the fees provided for herein. These fees may include:
   (A)   Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's
pretreatment program;
   (B)   Fees for monitoring, inspecting, sampling, and analyzing procedures;
   (C)   Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction;
   (D)   Fees for permit applications and permits;
   (E)   Fees for removal by the city of pollutants otherwise subject to
national categorical pretreatment standards;
   (F)   Ten percent late fee for any unpaid invoice which is 30 days past the
due date;
   (G)   Industrial wastewater surcharge.
      (1)   The industrial wastewater surcharge is a reimbursement for
exceptional treatment costs imposed on industrial users for exceeding the city
wastewater treatment plant design criteria for domestic strength wastewater
concentrations. Assessment of surcharges does not alleviate the industrial user
of the responsibility to comply with pretreatment requirements. Consistent
noncompliance by an industrial user will result in enforcement actions as
defined by this chapter. Surcharges shall be calculated as follows:
Surcharge for TSS = S x S1 - Sd x 8.34 x Flow
Surcharge for BOD = B x B1 - Bd x 8.34 x Flow
S    Unit cost of treating TSS measured in dollars per pound ($/lb)
S1   TSS concentration measured in milligrams per liter (mg/l)
Sd   TSS concentration in domestic wastewater measured in milligrams per liter
     (mg/l)
B    Unit cost of treating BOD measured in dollars per pound ($/lb)
B1   BOD concentration measured in milligrams per liter (mg/l)
Bd   BOD Concentration in domestic wastewater measured in milligrams per liter
     (mg/1)
Flow Volume discharged measured in million gallons per day (MGD)
 
      (2)   The costs of treating total suspended solids and BOD shall be
adjusted annually to reflect increases or decreases in wastewater treatment
costs based on the previous year's experience. The initial coefficients of
costs for use in the foregoing formula shall be:
S = $0.18/lb. and B = $0.18/lb.
      (3)   The city shall bill the discharger by the month and shall invoice
industrial waste charges separate from the regular bill for water and sewer
charges. The discharger shall pay monthly in accordance with practices existing
for payment of sewer charges in Chapter 51 of the City of Willis Code of
Ordinances.
   (H)   Monthly surcharge for all other contaminants. Industrial users shall
be assessed a surcharge of $25 per contaminant per day for all other violations
of the industrial pretreatment ordinance. Monthly surcharges is not a penalty
payment for violations of the industrial users discharge permit but a
reimbursement for exceptional treatment costs due to the additional pollutant
loading of the treatment plant. Assessment of surcharges does not alleviate the
industrial user of the responsibility to comply with pretreatment requirements.
Consistent non-compliance by an industrial user will result in enforcement
actions as defined by this chapter.
   (I)   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.165 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Enforcement response plan. The city shall develop and implement an
enforcement response plan which contains detailed procedures indicating how the
city will investigate and respond to instances of industrial user noncompliance
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5). The major types of enforcement responses
to be implemented by the city are identified below.
   (B)   Enforcement actions.
      (1)   Notification of violation. Whenever the pretreatment coordinator
finds that any user has violated or is violating this chapter or its discharge
permit or any prohibition contained herein, the pretreatment coordinator shall
serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation.
When required by the pretreatment coordinator, within 30 days from the date of
the notice the industrial user shall submit a detailed explanation concerning
the cause of the violation and actions that will be taken to circumvent future
violations. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability
for any action occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
      (2)   Consent orders. The pretreatment coordinator is hereby empowered to
enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for
the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order.
      (3)   Show cause hearing.
         (a)   The Director of Public Works may order any individual user which
causes or contributes to violations of this chapter or wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to show cause before the director why a proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
principal executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a
duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action
may be pursued.
         (b)   The Director of Public Works shall conduct any show cause
hearing ordered pursuant to this section and may:
            1.   Issue notices requesting the attendance of witnesses and the
production of evidence relevant to matters involved in such hearing;
            2.   Take evidence;
            3.   Make findings; and
            4.   Order, on behalf of the city, any enforcement action
authorized pursuant to this chapter which he shall deem reasonably necessary
upon the basis of such findings.
         (c)   The Director of Public Works shall afford reasonable opportunity
for any person who is the subject of a proposed enforcement action to present
evidence and to question all persons who shall appear at such hearing. Any
person who shall be the subject of such hearing may be represented by legal
counsel.
      (4)   Compliance order. When the Director of Public Works, upon the basis
of evidence received at a show cause hearing ordered pursuant to this section,
finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter
or a permit or order issued there under or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the
discharge directing that following a specified time period, sewer service shall
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also
contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
release the user of liability for a violation, including any continuing
violation.
      (5)   Cease and desist orders. When the Director of Public Works, upon
the basis of evidence received at a show cause hearing ordered pursuant to this
section, finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the city may issue an
order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to:
         (a)   Comply forthwith; or
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
      (6)   Emergency suspensions.
         (a)   The pretreatment coordinator is authorized, without prior notice
or hearing, to immediately suspend the wastewater service and/or industrial
user permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the
pretreatment coordinator, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the
POTW or causes the city to violate any conditions of its NPDES permit.
         (b)   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the industrial user permit shall immediately stop or eliminate
the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the pretreatment department shall take
such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to
any individuals or the environment. The pretreatment department shall reinstate
the industrial user permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof
of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge.
         (c)   Any person so notified of the emergency suspension of any permit
pursuant to this section shall be directed to appear and show cause before the
Director of Public Works as provided by this chapter why such suspension should
not be confirmed or why such other proposed enforcement action should not be
ordered.
      (7)   Termination of permit.
         (a)   An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part for
imminent endangerment shall submit to the pretreatment department, a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, prior to the date of the
hearing described in division (B)(3) of this section.
         (b)   Any user who violates the following conditions of this chapter
or applicable state and federal regulations is subject to having their permit
revoked in accordance with the procedures of this section.
            1.   Failure to notify the city of significant wastewater prior to
the changed discharge;
            2.   Failure to provide prior notification to the city of changed
condition;
            3.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant
facts in the wastewater discharge permit application;
            4.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
            5.   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
            6.   Refusing to allow the city timely access to the facility
premises and records;
            7.   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
            8.   Failure to pay fines;
            9.   Failure to pay sewer charges;
            10.   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
            11.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application;
            12.   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or the ordinance;
            13.   Failure to provide an advance notice of the transfer of a
permit facility.
         (c)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show
cause before the Director of Public Works why the proposed action should not be
taken.
         (d)   Wastewater discharge permits shall be revocable upon non-use,
cessation of operations, or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater
discharge permits are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge
permit.
      (8)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit
issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and
service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
      (9)   Administrative fines.
         (a)   When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated
or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the city may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,000.
Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
         (b)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 15 days of being notified of the fine. The Director of Public Works
shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of receiving the request
from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment shall
be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
         (c)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against,
or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
      (10)   Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment requirement, the pretreatment department,
through the city attorney, may petition the court for the issuance of a
preliminary or permanent injunction, or both (as may be appropriate) which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the industrial user.
      (11)   Judicial relief and administrative penalty by the EPA. The
Environmental Protection Agency may seek judicial relief and may also use
administrative penalty authority when the POTW has sought a monetary penalty
which the Environmental Protection Agency believes to be insufficient.
      (12)   Civil penalties.
         (a)   Any user who is found to have violated an order of the City
Council or who failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits
issued hereunder, shall be fined not more than $2,000 for each offense. Each
day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct offense.
         (b)   The city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs,
court reporters' fees, other expenses of litigation and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. A lien
against the individual user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines
and penalties.
      (13)   Criminal penalties. Any user who shall violate any of the
provisions of this chapter or suffer or allow the same to be violated, shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished
by a fine not to exceed $2,000 a day for each violation. Each day during which
such violation shall continue to exist shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense.
      (14)   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representations, or certifications in any applications, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to
this chapter or industrial user permit or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of no less than $500
for each separate violation.
      (15)   Supplemental enforcement action.
         (a)   Performance bonds. The pretreatment coordinator may decline to
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, or any orders, or a previous wastewater
discharge permit issued hereunder, unless such user first files a satisfactory
bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the
pretreatment coordinator to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
         (b)   Liability insurance. The pretreatment coordinator may decline to
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, any order, or a previous wastewater
discharge permit issued hereunder, unless the user first submits proof that it
has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the
POTW caused by its discharge.
         (c)   Public nuisances. Any violation of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public
nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the pretreatment
department. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to
reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying
said nuisance.
   (C)   Affirmative defense to discharge violations.
      (1)   Act of God. In an action brought in municipal or state court, if a
person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a
pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under this chapter was caused solely
by an Act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a
violation of this chapter or permit. An Act of God is defined as an
extraordinary interruption by a natural cause (as a flood or earthquake) of the
usual course of events that experience, prescience, or care cannot reasonably
foresee or prevent.
      (2)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general and specific prohibitions in § 53.153(a) through (g) of this chapter.
If it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either:
         (a)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
         (b)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
      (3)   Bypass. 
         (a)   For the purposes of this section:
            BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion
of a user's treatment facility.
            SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
         (b)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3)d. and (3)e. of this section.
         (c)   Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
(e) of this section.
         (d)   The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (C)(3)(c) of this section.
         (e)   Notification.
            1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the city, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
            2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times; if the
bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue;
and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of
the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if
the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.166 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION.
   In accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.8(f)(2)(vii), at least annually, the city
will provide public notification, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the
city, the industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were
significantly violating applicable pretreatment standards or other pretreatment
requirements.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.167 INTERCEPTOR REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Interceptor requirement. Grease, oil, sand and lint interceptors shall
be provided when, in the opinion of the city, they are necessary to prevent
grease in excessive amounts, flammable wastes, sand, lint, or other
objectionable waste from entering the sanitary sewer system. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city and shall be located as to
be easily and safely accessible for cleaning and inspection. All interceptors
shall be continuously maintained in satisfactory and effective operation by the
industrial user at the user's expense.
   (B)   Storage and disposal of grease and solids. Industrial users who
generate waste grease should store it in grease containers and obtain a waste
grease service company to disposal.
   (C)   Prohibition of sludge discharge. In no instance should waste grease
that is generated at a facility be discharged to any drains or the interceptor.
   (D)   Recovery of maintenance expenses.
      (1)   Any maintenance expenses incurred by the city due to prohibited
discharges from interceptors, or any other expenses attributable thereto, will
be charged to the industrial user or users identified by the city as being in
violation of the provisions contained herein and therefore solely responsible
for, or responsible for contributing to, such unlawful discharge.
      (2)   Refusal by an industrial user to reimburse the city for maintenance
expenses shall constitute a violation of the provisions contained herein and
may result in civil action or severance of the user's water supply.
   (E)   Pumping schedules. Interceptors should be pumped at a frequency (a
minimum of every three months and a maximum of every six months) that will
eliminate the possibility of intercepted waste entering the sanitary sewer
system. The amount of waste that may be accumulated in an interceptor prior to
pumping is dependent upon the loading of the interceptor and the impact that
industries in a particular service area, as a whole, may have on the POTW.
   (F)   Disposal of wastes from interceptors. Storage, handling,
transportation and disposal of all wastes from interceptors shall be performed
in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations that
pertain to the type and/or class of waste. Materials removed from waste
interceptors must be disposed of at legally designated locations for those
specific type wastes. Failure to dispose of waste properly may result in civil
action by the city.
   (G)   Records.
      (1)   Transportation and disposal of waste from interceptors shall be
documented by means of a liquid waste manifest.
      (2)   A copy of all manifests signed by the transporter shall be
maintained at the site of the interceptor for a period of three years.
Manifests must be available to the city at all times.
      (3)   A copy of manifests signed by the disposal company shall be mailed
the city pretreatment coordinator at least quarterly.
      (4)   Failure of an industrial user to obtain a manifest from the
transporter may result in a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $200 per
violation.
      (5)   Failure of an industrial user to obtain a copy of a liquid waste
manifest signed by the disposal company, at the city's request, or the
inability of the user to produce evidence that a request for the document has
been made and follow-up action has been taken to assure proper execution and
routing of manifests in the future may result in a fine of not less than $100
nor more than $200 per violation.
   (H)   Inspections.
      (1)   Periodic inspections of interceptors will be conducted by the
city's pretreatment department; however, it is the responsibility of the
industrial users to assure that interceptors are properly maintained.
      (2)   Interceptors which are located in parking lots or other areas where
vehicles may reasonably be expected to be parked must be protected by a
permanent barrier, railing, or other means, at the owner's expense, if it is
determined necessary by the pretreatment department to ensure continued and
uninterrupted access to the interceptor.
      (3)   If at any time, as the result of an inspection, the pretreatment
department determines that the condition of an interceptor is such that it has
the potential to adversely affect the sewerage system, the Pretreatment
Department shall request that the interceptor be pumped within a specified
period of time.
      (4)   Failure to comply with a request to pump an interceptor within a
given period of time constitutes a violation of the provisions contained herein
and may result in civil action by the city and/or a fine of not less than $200
nor more than $500 per day of violation. Prolonged negligence by a user in
having an interceptor pumped may result in the city engaging the services of a
waste hauler to pump the interceptor. If such situation occurs, the city's cost
for having the interceptor pumped will be passed on to the user, in addition to
the appropriate fine.
   (I)   Permitting.
      (1)   Industrial users who, at the city's discretion, receive interceptor
discharge permits will be classified as “non-significant” industrial users.
      (2)   Interceptor discharge permits shall be issued to industrial users
who the city determines have a potential to adversely affect the city's POTW
due to any of the following:
         (a)   The volume of objectionable waste generated that must be removed
prior to discharging into the POTW;
         (b)   The adverse impact that waste from a heavy industrial area, as a
whole, may have on the city's collection system;
         (c)   A facility's previous history of prohibited discharge
violations; or
         (d)   The use of microorganisms as a means of reducing interceptor
pumping frequencies.
      (3)   Interceptor discharge permits shall specify the minimum frequency
at which users must have wastes removed from their interceptors; however, it is
the responsibility of the user to have wastes removed more frequently than
specified in the permit during situations when excessive waste is generated.
      (4)   The permitted user must give the pretreatment department an
advanced notice when unscheduled pumping is required due to excessive waste
loading.
      (5)   Interceptor discharge permits may be modified or terminated when
deemed necessary by the pretreatment department.
      (6)   Requests for permit modification, revocation, or termination by the
user must be submitted in writing to the city Director of Public Works.
      (7)   Industrial users who are permitted due to a request to use
microorganisms as a means of reducing pumping frequency will be required to
have their interceptors inspected by the Pretreatment Department at a frequency
to be specified by the Pretreatment Coordinator. The cost of inspections will
be passed on to the industrial user.
   (J)   Enforcement of interceptor requirements. Enforcement of the provisions
of this section shall also be in accordance with the provisions of §
53.165, enforcement, with the exception of “civil penalties.” Civil penalties
for violations of the provisions of this section shall not exceed $500 per day
for each offense. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall
be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the penalties
provided herein, the city may recover other expenses of litigation by
appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this section
or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder.
   (K)   Construction and operation and maintenance of interceptors.
      (1)   Should the city determine that an interceptor is required at a
facility or that an existing interceptor needs to be upgraded, the city may
request construction accordingly.
      (2)   Should construction be required, the industrial user shall submit a
construction schedule to the pretreatment department within 60 days from
notification of the required construction. The schedule shall include the name,
address, and telephone number of the plumber who will do the work and the dates
that installation will commence and be completed.
      (3)   Proper authorization must also be obtained from the city's building
inspection department. Reconstruction of existing facilities shall be in
accordance with the requirements of Chapter 15 of the city's plumbing code.
      (4)   Failure to comply with any of the above requirements may result in
severance of water service or civil action by the city.
   (L)   Grease trap additives.
      (1)   The city prohibits the use of emulsifying agents and the sole use
of enzymes, which have not proven to be effective in the elimination of oil and
grease. Industrial and or commercial users who intend to use microorganisms as
a means of reducing grease in interceptors must first request an industrial
user interceptor permit from the city and provide the city with technical data
concerning the type of microorganism to be used. Those users who were using
microorganisms prior to adoption of this chapter must apply for a permit and
provide the required technical data within 60 days of the effective date of
this chapter. The use of microorganisms does not eliminate the need to pump
grease from interceptors. Grease trap pumping frequencies will be based upon
solids accumulation in the trap.
      (2)   The pretreatment department has the authority to prohibit the use
of any particular type of microorganism, or microorganisms as a whole, if there
is reason to believe that the use of such additives may result in an adverse
impact on the POTW.
      (3)   Industrial users who use microorganisms must maintain records at
the facility which indicates the most recent date of application, the volume
added, and the depth of the grease at the time of the application. These
records must be maintained at the site for a period of one year and the
information must be available to the city at all times. Failure to maintain
this information at the site may result in a fine of not less than $100 nor
more than $200 per violation.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.168 RIGHT-OF-ENTRY.
   (A)   Legal authority. The pretreatment coordinator and other authorized
representatives or employees of the city, bearing proper credentials and
identification, shall be permitted to enter immediately upon any premises in
which a wastewater source is located, or in which any records required to be
maintained pursuant to this chapter are located, and may have access to and
copy any records, and conduct any inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, or testing necessary to enforce this chapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the city has been refused access to a building,
structure or property or any part thereof, and if the pretreatment department
has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection
program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then upon application by the City
Attorney, the municipal court judge of the city shall issue a search and/or
seizure warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the
warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything may be searched and/or
seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable
hours by the pretreatment department in the company of a uniformed police
officer of the city. In the event of an emergency affecting public health and
safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.169 CONFIDENTIALITY/TRADE SECRETS.
   Any information submitted to the city by an industrial user may be claimed
as confidential by the submitter. Any such claim must be asserted at the time
of submission, by stamping the words “confidential business information” on
each page containing such information. The industrial user must demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets under applicable state law. If no claim is made at the time of
submission, the city may make the information available to the public without
further notice. If a claim is asserted, the information will be treated in
accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR Part 2 (Public Information), but shall
be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses
related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and enforcement
proceeding involving the person furnishing the report. Effluent data
(wastewater constituents characteristics) as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be considered confidential under any circumstances and shall be available to
the public without restrictions.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.170 FINAL COMPLIANCE REPORT.
   (A)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the
significant industrial user with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements set forth in this chapter, in a wastewater discharge permit, or
within 30 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW by a new source or new users considered by the city to fit the
definition of SIU, the affected user shall submit to the city a report
containing the information outlined in this chapter.
   (B)   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 C.F.R.
pt. 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.171 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT.
   (A)   Any user that is required to have an industrial waste discharge permit
and performs self-monitoring shall submit to the city during the months of June
and December, unless required on other dates or more frequently by the city, a
report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous reporting
period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the
industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users shall sample their
discharge at least twice per year.
   (B)   The report shall include a record of the concentrations (and mass if
specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the
wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of all flow
measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations,
and shall also include any additional information required by this chapter or
the wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required
by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user sampled
and analyzed more frequently than what was required by the city or by this
chapter, using methodologies in 40 C.F.R. pt. 136, it must submit all results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.
   (C)   Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the city or by unit production limits specified in the
applicable categorical standards, shall report production data as outlined in
this section.
   (D)   If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or non-
regulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the
regulated process flows, dilution flows and non-regulated flows.
   (E)   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement; provided,
however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual
measurement is not feasible.
   (F)   Sampling shall be representative of the user's daily operations and
shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in this chapter.
   (G)   The city may require reporting by users that are not required to have
an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to
establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of this effluent, or
determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of
the sewer system.
   (H)   The city may require self-monitoring by the user or may agree to
perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to prepare the periodic
compliance report required under this section. If the city agrees to perform
such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the user for such
monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the sampling and
analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer charge and shall
be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under no obligation to
perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.172 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES FOR MEETING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
   (B)   No increment referred to in division (A) above shall exceed nine
months.
   (C)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the city
including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.173 NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION CHANGES.
   Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the city within two
business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production
level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
providing a notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with
the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 53.174 SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR SELF-MONITORING AND CITY-MONITORING.
   (A)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. The city will
determine on a case-by-case whether the user will be able to composite the
individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples
must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where
feasible. The city may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user
that demonstrates that flow-proportional is infeasible. In such cases, samples
may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or
through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this
will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
   (B)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the city
and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users,
if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 C.F.R. pt. 403.6(e) in
order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment
standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to
factor out dilution flows, the user should measure the flows and concentrations
necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s).
   (C)   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place, of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than
what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40

accurately record the amount of water used. The city has recently installed
electronic meters on all connections.
   (B)   The city has established a regularly scheduled maintenance program of
meter testing, repair and replacement. All production meters located at the
water plant are tested and calibrated annually. Meters are maintained within
the accuracy of plus or minus 5%, in order to measure and account for the
amount of water diverted from the source of supply. Meter replacement
recommendations are followed using the manufacturer’s guidelines.
   (C)   After each monthly water meter reading, an evaluation of each
customer’s usage is made. Zero consumption accounts are checked to see if water
is actually being used or not. At this time it is also determined what action,
if any, must be taken to reduce water consumption. An additional evaluation is
made to determine what the city must do to change its conservation plan or
policies.

commercial property, shall be the responsibility of the developer. All
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with city standards and
specifications.
(Ord. 18-0320A, passed 3-20-2018)
§ 58.03 EXTENSION OF UTILITIES TO A SUBDIVISION OR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN CITY
LIMITS.
   The following shall be applicable to extension of retail water or sanitary
sewer service to a subdivision or development within the corporate limits of
the city.
   (A)   Developers desiring retail water or sanitary sewer service from the
city shall comply with this code to obtain said service from the city for the
development and to extend the city's water and sewer system to the development,
and shall enter into a development agreement with the city that contains the
details, including costs, of such provision of services. In no event shall
developers be allowed to pay a lower cost for extending water or sewer
facilities or mains than individuals and non-developers are required to pay.
   (B)   It shall be the developer's responsibility to acquire and/or designate
any utility easements needed to extend the utility line from its present
terminus or nearest location to the developer's property. The legal document
used to acquire the right-of-way shall be reviewed and approved by the City
Attorney and City Engineer prior to the document being presented to the land
owner for consideration. The cost of the required easements shall be reimbursed
as part of the total cost of the extension in the manner set forth in this
section. The location, width, and cost of such easements shall be subject to
the approval of the city. Should the developer be unable to acquire the needed
easements, the city, at its option, may assist in the acquisition negotiations.
   (C)   The total cost of a utility line extension shall include all costs
associated with the extension, including easement acquisitions, engineering
costs, materials costs, construction costs, and any other costs for studies or
surveys related to the extension, less the city's share in cases of required
excess improvements.
   (D)   The extensions of retail water service and sanitary sewer service
shall be figured separately and treated as separate and individual extensions
for the purposes stated in this section.
   (E)   Water and sanitary sewer line extensions may be installed by the city
or by the developer's contractor. This decision shall be made by the Council
prior to the project being advertised for bid. In either case, the size,
location, materials to be used, and installation practices shall be in
accordance to the city's design standards and approved by the City Engineer
along with being subject to inspection and approval by the City Engineer.
   (F)   When the city installs the utility line extension, the developer shall
pay in cash or provide an unconditional guarantee from a financial institution,
approved by the city, for the developer's share of the utility expansion as
determined by the city. A final accounting will occur at the end of the
project. The guarantee shall be filed with the City Secretary in letter form
from the financial institution and be signed by its principal loan officer. The
guarantee shall state the name of the project or identify the property and
shall list the improvements the developer is required to provide. This payment
or guarantee must be filed with the city after bids have been received and
prior to the project commencing.
   (G)   A pro rata share of the total cost of an extension shall be assessed
to each property that seeks service from the extension as provided in this
section. The pro rate share for water utilities will be based on the property
frontage along the proposed water utility. The pro rata share for sanitary
utilities will be based on the property acreage.
   (H)   The basis for the cost of construction will be reviewed and approved
by the city prior to communicating with the property owners along the utility
extension route. The city will maintain a list of all property owners having
paid their pro rata share prior to beginning construction.
   (I)   Any customer requesting service who has not paid his pro rata share
prior to the installation of the utility extension must pay the pro rata share
in full, in addition to the connection charges for water and sanitary sewer
taps as set forth in this code, before service will be connected.
   (J)   A developer, CDC, or EDC that contributes in excess of his or her pro
rata share for construction of a utility extension will be eligible for
refunds. When assessed property owners do not pay their pro rata share at the
time of installation, they will be charged as set forth in this section. The
pro rata share shall be refunded to the developer, CDC, and EDC by the city.
The developer, the city, CDC, and EDC shall be eligible for reimbursements in
this manner for a period of ten years from the date installation of the
extension is completed. The city shall continue to collect the pro rata shares
from property owners who have not paid as they request service. See
Table § 58.03(J) below for an example.

TOTAL       $1,000,000                       $337,500   100%
NOTES
1.   Entities will be reimbursed over the next 10 years as new development
occurs. Entities will be paid back based on the percentage of their
contribution. The total reimbursement may not exceed the amount shown in the
difference column.
2.   The example above is for a project with the total sewer cost of $750,000
and a total water cost of $250,000. The example assumes developer D and
developer E are not going to participate, but the EDC or CDC will
participate.
 
   (K)   The city may connect any future customer to the extended lines
provided the customer pays a pro rata charge and the connection charge for
water and sanitary sewer taps as set forth in this code.
   (L)   The criteria for calculating the pro rata charge to property owners is
as follows.
      (1)   The pro rata charge for each property where water utilities are to
become available by installation of an extension will be based on the property
frontage along the proposed water utility. The pro rata charge for each
property where sanitary utilities are to become available by installation of an
extension will be based on the property acreage.
      (2)   In making the calculations, the city will determine in advance
which properties in the vicinity of the extension are capable of being served.
Each of these parcels of property will then be included in the calculations. If
the city determines that a property is not likely to tie into the system, it
will be omitted from the calculations. Any owner of property that has been
excluded from calculation in this manner who, at a later time, desires to
connect to the utility extension will have to pay a pro rata share.
      (3)   The total project cost including engineering, surveying,
geotechnical testing, construction materials testing, construction,
construction administration and inspection will be divided by all the tracts
participating. This amount will be shared with all the participants. The total
cost will be divided between each participating property based on the property
frontage for water utilities and property acreage for sewer utilities. See
Table § 58.03(L)(3) below for an example.

NOTES
1.   The cost for the developers that do not participate would be equally
divided by the number of developers that do participate, and that number would
be added to the total project cost for the participants.
2.   The example above is for a project with the total sewer cost of $750,000
and a total water cost of $250,000. The example assumes developer D and
developer E are not going to participate, but the EDC or CDC will participate.
 
      (4)   Properties that do not front on or abut the utility extension
right-of-way, but which can be served by the extension, shall be subject to the
pro rata assessment for the original extension plus that particular extension
necessary to serve the tract that does not front the utility.
      (5)   Any condition not covered in this section or of such a nature that
strict application of the procedures established in this section would result
in an inequitable pro rata change to a property owner may be negotiated by the
City Council at the time the original calculation is made for a proposed
extension.

§ 58.04 CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITIES WITHIN A SUBDIVISION OR DEVELOPMENT.
   The following shall be applicable to the construction of utilities within a
subdivision or development, or extensions of utilities to a subdivision
development.
   (A)   The developer of an addition to the city, the final plat or plan of
which has been approved by the City Council, shall design and prepare
construction plans and specifications for the water supply and sanitary sewer
facilities to serve the subdivision, including any required excess improvements
or off-site facilities. Each plan shall conform in all details to the city
standards as to design, grade, location, size, and quality of materials and
construction, and shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer
licensed in the State of Texas and shall bear his seal.
   (B)   All specifications for construction contracts shall be based upon the
city's standard specifications for materials and performance.
   (C)   No installation of water and sewer lines will be made at any other
location except in a dedicated street or alley or an easement dedicated to and
accepted by the city prior to it being filed for record by the city of the
addition to be subdivided.
   (D)   Utility extensions to a subdivision or development shall extend across
the entire length of the development from the closest point of connection to
the furthest point of connection, unless it is determined by the City Engineer
that the extension will not be continued beyond the developer's subdivision or
development.
   (E)   The construction and installation of the water and sanitary sewer
system shall be supervised and approved by the City Engineer to ensure that the
installation is in accordance with the approved plans, city specifications, and
the applicable regulatory agency approvals. The city specifications shall be a
part of every contract that is let.
   (F)   The City Manager, the Director of Public Works for the city, the City
Engineer, or their authorized representatives shall have the authority to see
that the work is performed in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications. If the water and sanitary sewer work is not being performed in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications, then the work shall be
stopped until such time as proper corrections are made. Should work progress
without correction, the city has the option to not accept the utility extension
for ownership and maintenance and the utility remains a private line.
   (G)   The sizes of the mains proposed to be extended shall be determined by
the City Engineer and shall be in conformance with the water and sanitary sewer
utility infrastructure master plans. The total costs of extending the mains to
the developer's property shall be borne solely by the developer, with the
following exceptions.
      (1)   Upon approval and acceptance of the system by the city, on any
mains larger than eight inches, the city may elect to participate in the cost
by refunding the developer the difference between the cost of the oversized
mains and the eight inch main.
      (2)   The city will also reimburse the original developer, CDC, and EDC
pro rata charges as received from applicants who desire to connect to the
mains, with the total payment not to exceed the amount of the original
applicant's cost of off-site improvements.
      (3)   The maximum period of time for the pro rata reimbursement to the
original developer for the off-site mains shall not exceed ten years following
approval and acceptance of the utility line extension by the city. The
developer, CDC, and EDC shall have no claim against the city for any expenses
not reimbursed and any pro rata charges not received within ten years, nor any
fees received after ten years.
      (4)   Pro rata charges, if any, shall be collected by the city from each
intervening property owner, regardless of when the property owner expresses
interest in connecting, along the extended water and sewer mains at the time of
application for water or sewer services by said property owner.
   (H)   Any installations, when completed and approved by the City Engineer
and accepted by City Council, shall become the property of the city, free and
clear of all encumbrances. The contractor shall indemnify the city against any
repair which may become necessary to any part of the work performed arising
from defective workmanship or materials for a period of one year from the date
of final acceptance of the work.
(Ord. 18-0320A, passed 3-20-2018)
§ 58.05 EXTENSION OF UTILITIES TO A SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LOT/TRACT.
   The city will not extend off-site water and sanitary sewer lines to single-
family lots within the corporate limits of the city. All costs incurred in the
extension of a utility will be paid by the lot owner. The lot owner is
responsible for all costs of the service lines between the public line and the
home.
(Ord. 18-0320A, passed 3-20-2018)
§ 58.06 EXTENSION OF UTILITIES TO A SUBDIVISION OR DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE CITY
LIMITS.
   (A)   Developers desiring retail water or sewer service from the city and
whose property is located outside the city limits shall request annexation into
the city in order to obtain water and sewer service. If, at the time the
request is made the city is unable to annex the property, the developer and the
city may enter into a written development agreement that addresses whether and
under what terms, if any, the city will provide service.
   (B)   Properties outside the city limits that will be served by a utility
extension but not annexed by the city will pay their pro rata share to the city
to offset the additional costs to the city. Policies regarding payment,
reimbursement of the developer, and the calculation and payment of pro rata
shares or participating property owners are the same as stated in this
division.
(Ord. 18-0320A, passed 3-20-2018)
§ 58.07 EXTENSION OF UTILITIES TO AN INDIVIDUAL OR NON-DEVELOPER.
   (A)   This section applies to a request for retail water or sewer service in
the city's water service area from individuals or non-developers.
   (B)   Upon the approval of an application from an individual or non-
developer, and upon payment of all applicable fees and charges due under this
section and at the expense of the applicant, the city may extend all necessary
water and sewer facilities and mains to the property plus the distance across
the entire frontage necessary to provide the service upon the premises for
which the applications have been made.
      (1)   The city will not pay the cost of extending water or sanitary sewer
facilities and mains to the property. The applicant shall be responsible for
paying all costs to extend the water and sanitary sewer facilities and mains.
The applicant shall pay the estimate of such cost prior to construction. If the
actual cost to extend the water or sanitary sewer mains and facilities is
greater than the estimated costs, the applicant shall pay the city the
difference between the actual and estimated costs upon completion of the
extension project. If the estimated cost to extend the water or sanitary sewer
mains or facilities is greater than the actual cost, the city shall reimburse
the applicant the difference between the actual and estimated costs upon
completion of the extension project.
      (2)   The owners of all intervening properties served by such extension
shall be required to pay the pro rata charges at such time as their property is
connected to the city's water and sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Upon approval of the city, the property owner or person requesting
extension of water or sanitary sewer facilities or mains to his or her property
may extend the mains or facilities by a competent and reputable contractor. All
plans and construction shall comply with city standards and specifications.
Detailed construction plans for the improvements, complying with the city's
construction standards and specifications for public works construction, shall
be drawn by a registered professional engineer and approved by the City
Engineer prior to any construction. The construction shall be inspected and
approved by the City Engineer prior to final acceptance by the city, and all
expenses associated with such inspections and approvals shall be borne by the
person requesting services.
      (4)   The size of the main proposed to be extended shall be determined by
the City Engineer and shall be in conformance with the water and sanitary sewer
utility infrastructure master plans. The total costs of extending the mains to
and across the applicant's property shall be borne solely by the applicant,
with the following exceptions.
         (a)   Upon approval and acceptance of the system by the city, on any
mains larger than eight inches, the city may elect to participate in the cost
by refunding the applicant the difference between the cost of the oversized
mains and the eight inch main.
         (b)   The city will also pay to the original applicant pro rata
charges as received from customers who apply to the city to connect to the
mains, with the total payment to the property owner not to exceed the amount of
the original applicant's cost of off-site improvements. The city shall retain a
pro rata share amount for their portion of oversizing the line.
         (c)   The maximum period of time for the pro rata reimbursement to the
original applicant for the off-site mains shall not exceed ten years. The
applicant shall have no claim against the city for any expenses not reimbursed
and any pro rata charges not received within ten years, nor any fees received
after ten years.
         (d)   Pro rata charges, if any, shall be collected by the city from
each intervening property owner along the extended water and sewer mains at the
time of application for water or sanitary sewer services by said property
owner.
   (C)   In no event will the city be required to make extensions or
participate in the cost of improvements under the provisions of this section if
there are not funds available, or if, at the discretion of the city, the
extension or improvement may not be practical or otherwise warranted, or is for
any unreasonable consumer use.
   (D)   All water and sewer utilities within the designated easements are
owned and operated by the city after acceptance by the City Council. Any
extensions of the city's water and sanitary sewer facilities made by a
qualified service applicant or developer, after inspection and acceptance by
the City Engineer, shall be owned by the city after acceptance by the City
Council.
   (E)   Where recorded public utility easements do not exist on the property
of any individual, non-developer, or developer who is requesting water or sewer
service from the city, the individual, non-developer, or developer shall grant
a permanent recorded public utility easement for poles, wires, conduits,
drainage channels, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, gas lines, or
other utilities to the city. These easements shall be at least 20-feet wide.
However, if the City Engineer determines a greater width is necessary, the city
may require a width of up to 30 feet. For developers, the easements required by
this section shall comply with
Chapter 154 of this code. For individuals and non-developers, the easements
required by this section shall extend along all roadway frontages of the
property and shall parallel as closely as possible the street line frontage.
Failure to grant the required easements shall result in the denial of city
services. The easements shall conform to the standard form approved by the city
and shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer and the City Attorney
prior to the easement being accepted by City Council and filed for record at
Montgomery County.
   (F)   The city shall make the connection from the water line in an alley,
street, or right-of-way to the property line and will set the meter, when
required, at that point. The city shall make the connection from the sanitary
sewer main in an alley, street, or right-of-way to the property line. The city
is responsible for maintaining the functional integrity of all sewer mains and
service laterals located in public right-of-ways and public utility easements.
In order for the city to inspect and maintain the functional integrity of the
service laterals within the public right-of-ways and public easements, it shall
be the responsibility of each property owner with a new or existing sewer
service connection to install a sewer clean-out at the property line. Property
owners are responsible for maintaining their service lateral lines which extend
from the city mains to the residence or business in a free and flowing
condition.
   (G)   Service water lines on private property from the city's water meter to
the premises, including all connections, shall be installed, maintained, and
repaired at the expense of the property owners. All leaks and other defects in
the service line or sewer lateral on private property shall be promptly
repaired by the property owners. If required repairs are not completed within
ten days after written notice is mailed or hand delivered to the premises,
water service to the premises shall be terminated and shall not be restored
until the repairs are made and all applicable fees and expenses paid. Any
expenditures incurred by the city because of leaks or defects shall be charged
against the property owners and must be paid before water service is restored.
(Ord. 18-0320A, passed 3-20-2018)
§ 58.99 PENALTY.
   Any person violating this chapter, upon conviction, is punishable by a fine
in accordance with the following.
   (A)   Civil and criminal penalties. The city shall have the power to
administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter as may be required by
governing law. Any person violating any provision of this chapter is subject to
suit for injunctive relief as well as prosecution for criminal violations.
   (B)   Criminal prosecution. Any person violating any provision of this

that a provision of this chapter is violated shall constitute a separate
offense. An offense under this chapter is a misdemeanor.
   (C)   Civil remedies. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as a waiver
of the city's right to bring a civil action to enforce the provisions of this
chapter and to seek remedies as allowed by law, including, but not limited to,
injunctive relief to prevent specific conduct that violates this chapter or to
require specific conduct that is necessary for compliance with this chapter;

§ 91.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to fairly allocate non-consent tows among the
towing service providers when a vehicle’s owner or driver has no preference, or
cannot communicate a preference. There are rare occasions, though, where an
officer may need to utilize a “first wrecker” call. It may be due to a life
safety issue, such as when EMS personnel on the scene need a vehicle lifted off
of a person. It may also be because a scene is unstable and any further delay
would be detrimental to peace and order. In addition, it may be necessary
because the assigned tow truck did not arrive within the required time, or is
unable to effect the tow, and to wait any longer is unreasonable given the
conditions on scene, call volume, etc. However, a “first wrecker” call is not
to be used merely for an officer’s convenience or lack of patience.
(Ord. 21-0921, passed 9-21-2021)

§ 91.08 POLICE NON-CONSENT TOWS.
   (A)   The Police Chief is authorized and directed to maintain a voluntary
non-consent tow truck permit list of those city-permitted companies qualified
and willing to perform non-consent tows at the direction of the Police
Department. Participation in the list shall be voluntary; however, towing
companies accepting referrals from the list shall be deemed to have agreed to
the fee set by this chapter.
   (B)   Upon arrival at the scene of a wrecked or disabled vehicle, the police
officer shall determine if a police-authorized tow is necessary. If a non-
consent tow is necessary, the police officer shall utilize the department’s tow
truck management app to contact the next tow truck up on the rotation list to
tow the vehicle.
   (C)   If the tow dispatch is cancelled, or the tow truck arrives and
performs a service for which the driver doesn’t charge a fee (unlocking a
vehicle, jump starting a dead battery, etc.), the officer will utilize the tow
truck management app to cancel the tow truck, which will automatically place
that tow truck back on top of the rotation list.
   (D)   If the owner or driver of a motor vehicle that is wrecked or disabled
has a tow truck preference, that request will be honored if it would not cause
undue delay and immediate towing is unnecessary. Any tow truck or towing
company may tow the vehicle at the owner’s or driver’s request as long as it
has a valid state tow tag and cab card. If the wrecked or disabled vehicle has
any part or portion thereof upon the roadway, the tow truck responding to the
owner’s or driver’s request shall have 15 minutes to arrive at the scene and
remove the vehicle, or such shorter period of time if, in the discretion of the
police officer on the scene, such shorter period of time is necessary to
protect the safety and welfare of the public; otherwise, the vehicle may be
towed pursuant to a police-authorized tow. A heavy duty tow truck responding to
an owner’s request shall have 30 minutes to arrive at the scene.
   (E)   A towing company accepting a non-consent tow agrees to look
exclusively to the vehicle owners for payment of the fees. This section applies
to the police-ordered removal of vehicles which are interfering with traffic,
or for which removal is required for some other public safety or law
enforcement related purpose. This section does not apply to consent tows or
non-consent tows ordered by persons other than police officers of the city.
   (F)   A permit holder is qualified to be on such list if the permit holder
maintains:
      (1)   At least one permitted tow truck required to be on such lists; and
      (2)   A 24-hour tow truck service.
   (G)   When the police officer investigating a collision determines that a
motor vehicle involved in a collision is unable to safely proceed under its own
power, or when the police officer determines that the owner involved in a
collision is physically unable to safely move the motor vehicle to a location
where it will not create a traffic hazard, such officer shall request the owner
to designate the tow truck service that the owner desires to move the motor
vehicle.
      (1)   Such designation by the owner will be indicated in writing on a tow
form provided by the city and signed by the owner, or documented electronically
in the app.
      (2)   When the designation has been properly made, and the requested
towing service is on the department’s list, the police officer shall notify the
designated tow truck service through the tow truck management app. If the
towing service is not on the department’s list, the officer will ask the owner
to contact the towing service.
      (3)   If the designated tow truck service does not have a tow truck
available with a valid state tow tag and cab card, or the tow truck service
does not answer the phone, the owner will be requested to make another
designation.
   (H)   If the owner of a motor vehicle involved in a collision is physically
unable to designate the tow truck service desired to remove the vehicle, or the
owner fails or refuses to designate one, or has no preference:
      (1)   Such designation by the owner will be indicated in writing on a tow
form provided by the city and signed by the owner if the owner is physically
able. If not, the police officer shall indicate by notation on the form or
electronically in the tow truck management app.
      (2)   No person shall tow, carry or transport a motor vehicle under the
direction or authority of a police officer unless a tow slip has been issued to
the driver of the tow truck by a police officer, or approved by the officer in
the tow truck management app. Such tow truck slip shall be filled out by the
police officer on a form designated by the city or in the app. The tow truck
slip shall contain the following information:
         (a)   A complete description of the motor vehicle to be towed,
including the license plate number and the vehicle identification number;
         (b)   Any personal property contained within the motor vehicle which
is visible from outside that vehicle;
         (c)   Any visible missing parts or paraphernalia;
         (d)   Any visible damage to the inside or outside of the motor
vehicle;
         (e)   The location from which the vehicle is being towed;
         (f)   The date and time the vehicle is picked up by the tow truck;
         (g)   The reason the vehicle is being towed;
         (h)   The location to which the vehicle is to be towed;
         (i)   The towing and storage fee and fee schedule;
         (j)   The permit number of the tow truck being used for the tow;
         (k)   The signature and employee number of the police officer
authorizing the tow; and
         (l)   The signature and tow truck license number of the tow truck
driver.
   (I)   If the permit holder, after arrival at the scene, determines, in
conjunction with the police officer in charge, that assistance is needed, then
the permit holder shall arrange for such assistance within a reasonable time.
   (J)   The permit holder notified that it is up for a rotation tow shall
deliver a tow truck to the scene within 15 minutes of the notification. If the
notification is for a heavy duty tow truck, the permit holder shall deliver a
heavy duty tow truck to the scene within 30 minutes of the notification. If the
permit holder doesn’t intend to respond or declines to respond to the tow for
any reason, it will immediately refuse the tow notification in the tow truck
management app so that the officer can notify the next permit holder in the
rotation.

§ 95.06 COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.
   (A)   As compensation for the company's use and occupancy of the public
rights-of-way, the company shall pay an access line fee as set forth below, and
shall be in lieu of any lawful tax, license, charge, right-of-way permit, use,
construction, street cut or inspection fee; or other right-of- way related
charge or fee, whether charged to the company or its contractor(s), within the
city, except the usual general ad valorem taxes, special assessments and sales
tax levied in accordance with state law and equally applicable to all general
businesses in the city.
   (B)   The access line fee shall be based on the equitable apportionment of
the total costs of managing the public rights-of-way attributable to the
relative use of the public rights-of-way by the company in relation to other
users including the city. Costs shall be limited to those costs incurred by the
city directly related to managing the public rights-of-way as provided in
division (C) below.
   (C)   The costs of managing the public rights-of-way are the direct, actual,
and reasonably incurred costs the city incurs in managing the public rights-of-
way for the most immediate fiscal year prior to the effective date of this
chapter. Management activities are limited to: registering occupants; issuing
and processing construction permits; verifying public rights-of-way occupation;
inspecting work at job sites and restoration projects; management costs
associated with the implementation of this chapter; or any other expenses
attributable to the company or other public rights-of-way users. Costs of
managing do not include: fees and costs associated with the drafting of this
chapter or other similar ordinances; or litigation fees and costs associated
with interpretation of this chapter.
   (D)   The access line fee will be paid in quarterly installments 90 days
following the calendar quarter. The access line fee shall be comprised of the
sum of the access line fees collected monthly from customers residing within
the corporate limits of the city. The company shall not be liable for the
remittance of uncollectible access line fees to the city. The access line fee
shall be determined by dividing the company's share of the total costs of
managing the public rights-of-way caused by the company by the total access
lines. Lifeline and company official switched access lines shall not be
included in the computation of total access lines. The monthly access line fee
shall apply in full each month or portion thereof that a customer has an access
line.
   (E)   The access line fee shall be $.58 per access line per month. An
increase in the access line fee is permitted if substantiated by cost studies
provided to the company and approved by the City Council. The company will have
90 days from notification by the city to implement the increased access line
fee but in no event shall the company be required to implement the access line
fee on a date other than the first calendar date of any month. Interest will
not accrue on any amount collected by the company prior to remittance to the
city. Nothing in this chapter will preclude the company from recovering the
access line fee from its customers as a line item on the customers' bill.
   (F)   The company shall assess the access line fee on each access line
unless a telecommunications service provider has provided a signed statement to
the company that the telecommunications service provider is responsible for the
access line fee directly to the city. Upon the company receiving the signed
statement, the company is indemnified of all responsibility for the access line
fees on those access lines. Upon written request, the company will make the
signed statements from telecommunication service providers available for the
city's inspection.
   (G)   The city shall not seek or accept in-kind services in lieu of or as
additional payment or consideration from any user of the public rights-of-way
for use of the public rights-of-way.

fees, arising from injury to person or property proximately caused by the
negligent act or omission of company. City shall promptly notify company of any

company shall defend the claims. The company shall have the right to defend and
compromise the claims. The city shall cooperate in the defense of the claims.

requirements are being followed. The requestor/permittee is solely and wholly
responsible for compliance with this chapter and applicable state and federal
regulations relative to outdoor burning.
   (B)   Burning is permitted only if more than 50 feet from a structure, and
when the wind direction and other meteorological conditions are such that the
smoke and other pollutants will not present a hazard to any public road or have
an effect on any, building structure. Once the bum is initiated, if at any time
it causes or may tend to cause smoke to blow onto or across a street, roadway,
or highway, it is the responsibility of the person initiating the bum to post
flag persons on the affected roads.
   (C)   Fires must be kept downwind of, or at least 300 feet away from, any
structure containing sensitive receptors located on adjacent properties, unless

Admin. Code Title 30, § 111.203(7) as a manmade structure utilized for human
residence or business, the containment of livestock, or the housing of
sensitive live vegetation. The term MANMADE STRUCTURE does not include such
things as range fences, roads, bridges, hunting blinds, or facilities used
solely for the storage of hay or other livestock feeds. The term SENSITIVE LIVE
VEGETATION is defined as vegetation that has potential to be damaged by smoke
and heat, examples of which include, but are not limited to, nursery
production, mushroom cultivation, pharmaceutical plant production, or
laboratory experiments involving plants.

be less than six miles per hour (five knots) or greater than 23 miles per hour
(20 knots) during the burn period.

persistent low level atmospheric temperature inversions.
   (F)   Burning may begin no earlier than one hour after sunrise and must end

smoke must be extinguished at the end of the burn.
   (I)   Only brush/vegetation generated and gathered from the burn site area
will be permitted. There shall be no importation of brush from any other
properties for the purpose of burning.
(Ord. 19-0219, passed 2-19-2019)
§ 97.05 PARALLEL REQUIREMENTS.
   The authorization to conduct outdoor burning under this chapter does not
exempt or excuse the requestor/permittee from compliance with all other
applicable laws or ordinances, regulations, and orders from any governmental
entity having jurisdiction, even though the burning is otherwise conducted in
compliance with this chapter. The requestor/permittee, and property owner of
the burn site if other than the requester/permittee, shall be fully liable for
any and all damages resulting from a fire set by said requestor/permittee or
other individual participating in the burn activity.
(Ord. 19-0219, passed 2-19-2019)
§ 97.99 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.

forth herein or in state law as adopted, allegation and evidence of a culpable
mental state is not required for the proof of an offense defined by this
chapter.

permits shall submit a complete application for a SOBP pursuant to these
regulations within 60 days of the effective date of these regulations.
   (B)   An existing enterprise may continue to operate until the City
Manager's determination on the SOBP application is final. The SOBP application
receipt is required to be displayed in clear view at the premises of a Class I
enterprise and is to be readily available at any location at which a Class II
enterprise conducts business.
   (C)   If an existing Class I enterprise is in violation of the location
restrictions of §
110.23(E)(4), the enterprise may submit verified proof that the business has
not recouped the owner's investment prior to the date of application in lieu of
the certification required in that section. The required documentation shall
include:
      (1)   The amount of the owner's investment in the existing enterprise to
the date the proof is submitted;

      (3)   The existence or nonexistence of lease obligations, as well as any
contingency clauses therein permitting termination of the lease;

and a projection of yearly income. This may be in the form of tax returns or
reliable financial statements; and
      (5)   A proposed schedule for amortization of the investment, to be
considered in light of the intent of these regulations.
   (D)   Upon evaluation of the proof and a finding that a proposed
amortization is reasonable under the circumstances, the City Manager shall
approve a contingent SOBP. The contingent SOBP shall specifically state the
reasons that the SOBP would have been denied but for the fact that the
enterprise was in existence prior to enactment of these regulations.
   (E)   The contingent SOBP shall be renewed only through the amortization
period. No SOBP shall be issued for that location beyond that period unless
circumstances change so as to bring the enterprise into compliance with these
regulations. The contingent SOBP shall be subject to revocation and suspension
pursuant to these regulations.
   (F)   Upon finding that the proposal is not reasonable under the
circumstances, the City Manager shall make a reasonable counter proposal or
recommendation and the applicant may resubmit a revised proposal within 15-
days' notice of the City Manager's determination and counter proposal. If the
revised proposal is again found to be unreasonable by the City Manager, the
City Manager shall make a final determination to deny the SOBP.
   (G)   Any enterprise which operates in the area of the city affected by
these regulations at the time these regulations become effective shall have 60
days from the effective date to come into compliance with these regulations,
subject only to provisions for a contingent SOBP based on location.

110.27(E)(1)(d), and the crime is alleged to have occurred on the premises of
the Class I enterprise.

condition is a violation of these regulations.

to transfer the permit.
(Ord. 02-0521, passed 5-21-2002)
§ 110.26 PUBLIC HEARING ON HEALTH AND SAFETY.
   (A)   When the City Manager receives a written request for a public hearing
concerning a Class I SOBP application, the City Manager shall confirm that it
is: from an interested party; that the request specifically identified the SOBP
application at issue; that the request is timely filed; and that the request
specifically identifies health and safety concerns affected by the enterprise.
The City Manager shall then initiate the public hearing procedure as follows.
      (1)   A hearing official, appointed by the City Council, shall be
contacted by the City Manager and a date set for the public hearing.
      (2)   The hearing shall be scheduled at a public building within the
city.
      (3)   The hearing shall be scheduled either on a weekday at 7:00 p.m., or
on a Saturday morning at 9:30 a.m.
      (4)   The City Manager shall send the applicant a written notice of
hearing at least ten days in advance, stating the date, time, and place of the
hearing and shall make a copy of the notice of hearing available to the public.
      (5)   Publicizing the hearing shall be the responsibility of the
interested party who requested the hearing. The City Manager shall make
available to the public a copy of any request for hearing and the notice of
hearing.
      (6)   The City Manager shall place a sign at the location identified in
the application containing the time and place of the hearing.
      (7)   The hearing may be rescheduled by the hearing official for good
cause, including, for example, a large number of requests for a hearing that
indicate strong public interest in the matter. The hearing may be rescheduled a
second time if rescheduling was due to emergency circumstances such as extreme
weather conditions. If rescheduled, the new notice of hearing shall be
available to the public at the City Manager's office.
      (8)   The applicant may request that a court reporter make a record of
the hearing. The applicant must make this request at least two days prior to
the hearing and bear the cost of making an official record and one transcript
for the city. The hearing official shall arrange for the court reporter to take
the record of the hearing, including exhibits and testimony. One copy of the
transcript shall be provided to the hearing official to become the property of
the city.
   (B)   If a request for a public hearing is received by the City Manager
after the SOBP has been issued or renewed, the hearing shall be scheduled when
the next renewal application is filed. The City Manager shall confirm that the
request identifies health and safety concerns affected by the enterprise that
are not addressed in the current SOBP and that the request is filed by an
interested party. The request shall then be attached to the SOBP records. When
a renewal application is submitted, the City Manager shall initiate the hearing
as set out in division (A) above.
   (C)   If the request for public hearing is deficient, the City Manager shall
return it to the person who submitted the request with a notation stating the
deficiency. A request that does not comply with the requirements as stated in
divisions (A) or (B) above shall not extend the period of time in which a
request for hearing may be filed.
   (D)   The hearing shall be conducted by the hearing official under the
following guidelines. The hearing official shall liberally construe these
guidelines to allow the public input to protect the health and safety of a
community affected by the location of an enterprise and to allow the applicant
to address these concerns:
      (1)   Interested parties may employ legal counsel;
      (2)   The hearing official shall, upon prior request, provide for
appropriate facilities for any disabled person to be able to participate in the
hearing. This shall include, but not be limited to, interpreters for deaf or
hearing impaired participants, wheel chair access, and special seating
arrangements;
      (3)   Participants in the proceeding may supply interpreters for language
translation and the hearing official shall accommodate the translation of the
proceeding;
      (4)   The hearing official may exclude evidence that is irrelevant,
immaterial, or unduly repetitious. Relevance and materiality shall be evaluated
by the relation of the evidence to health and safety concerns directly related
to the SOBP at issue, and conditions which may be attached to the SOBP to
address those concerns. The hearing is not limited to the health and safety
concerns specifically identified in the hearing request; and
      (5)   If no request is made by the applicant for an official record, any
person may record, videotape, or transcribe the hearing, provided there is no
interference with the proceedings. The hearing official shall have the power to
limit any interference with the proceeding.
   (E)   The hearing official may continue the hearing to a date no later than
ten days after the initial hearing if:
      (1)   The hearing has lasted at least two and one-half hours and it
appears to the hearing official that a significant amount of time is still
required to fully present the public concerns and potential solutions to those
concerns;
      (2)   Issues have been raised at the hearing requiring additional
research in order to develop appropriate conditions to be attached to the SOBP
or that the parties need additional time to develop a solution to issues
identified at the hearing; and/or
      (3)   A continuance shall not be for the purpose of delay or for
developing new evidence.
   (F)   After the conclusion of the public hearing, the hearing official shall
produce a written statement containing the official's findings of public health
and safety concerns and recommendations for conditions to be attached to the
SOBP. The recommendations shall be forwarded to the City Manager, the
applicant, and the interested party who requested the hearing. When the hearing
official determines that public health and safety concerns exist, the City
Manager shall attach conditions as part of the SOBP. If no official record of
the hearing has been requested, the hearing official's statement shall be the
official record of the public hearing. The hearing official may consult with
the City Manager for the purpose of developing appropriate conditions to
address the health and safety concerns shown at the hearing.
   (G)   If evidence is produced at the hearing that would support denial of
the SOBP, the hearing official shall provide that information to the City
Manager, who shall investigate whether the evidence warrants denial or
revocation of the SOBP under these regulations.

or
      (7)   The enterprise or enterprise owner is convicted of a criminal

reasons for the action. Subject to a request for hearing pursuant to this
section, the revocation shall become final on the eleventh day after delivery

   Failure of the City Manager to take timely action or give notice of his or
her action on an application, or failure by the hearing official or hearing
examiner to timely conduct or give notice of the decision pursuant to a
hearing, shall entitle the applicant to the immediate issuance of a temporary
SOBP upon written demand. Demand shall be filed by the applicant with the City
Manager. A temporary SOBP shall be valid only until notice of the City
Manager's action on the application or the hearing examiner's order. This
section shall not apply where delay is caused by the action or inaction of the
applicant.
(Ord. 02-0521, passed 5-21-2002)
§ 110.32 SOBP RENEWALS.
   (A)   SOBP renewal applications must be filed not more than 30 days prior to
the expiration date of the SOBP. The form for renewal application shall be
provided by the City Manager.
   (B)   An annual nonrefundable renewal fee, to be set by the City Council,
shall accompany the application for renewal to defray costs of inspections and
investigation. The fee shall be paid in the form of a money order or cashier's
check.
   (C)   The renewal application shall contain:
      (1)   Certification by the applicant that there have been no changes in
the information provided in the initial application or the information which
has changed since the initial application, supported by related documentation
as required in the initial application; and
      (2)   An application for a Class I SOBP renewal shall contain a
certification that the enterprise is in operation. A Class I SOBP will not be
renewed if the enterprise has not commenced operation in the initial SOBP
application.
   (D)   The City Manager shall determine whether the permit may be renewed
based on the information contained in the renewal application. The renewal
permit shall be denied upon a finding of any of the conditions identified in §
110.27(E). Renewal or denial shall be issued within 14 days of receipt of the
completed renewal application or by the expiration date of the previous SOBP,
whichever period is longer.
   (E)   If a renewal application is submitted less than 15 days before the
previous SOBP expires, there shall be no temporary SOBP issued to extend the
SOBP. The original SOBP will expire and, until the City Manager's determination
on renewal, there will be no valid SOBP for operation during that period.
   (F)   If an enterprise fails to file its renewal application prior to the
expiration of the existing SOBP, the enterprise must file an application for a
new SOBP and the application shall be considered as any new application.
   (G)   Upon written request of any interested party filed with the City
Manager prior to issuance of a new Class I SOBP and specifically identifying
existing public health and safety concerns connected with the operation of that
enterprise, a public hearing will be held as provided for in §
110.26.
      (1)   The general public and all interested parties may present to the
hearing examiner information to support recommendations to the City Manager for
conditions relating to public health and safety to be attached to the SOBP
renewal.
      (2)   The request for a public hearing may be filed at any time during
the year, but the hearing will be scheduled when the application for renewal of
the Class I SOBP is filed. If issuance of the renewal is delayed solely to
accommodate the need for the public hearing, the existing SOBP shall be
automatically extended until the City Manager issues the renewed SOBP based on
the recommendations of the hearing official. The fact that there is a pending
pubic hearing does not revive a SOBP that lapses under the provisions of
divisions (E) and (F) above.
   (H)   If a permit has been suspended pursuant to §
110.28, the renewed permit will be suspended until the suspension period has
elapsed.
(Ord. 02-0521, passed 5-21-2002)

attempt to do so.

enterprise.
   (C)   Upon filing of a new application and posting the application with the
prior SOBP, the enterprise may continue to operate until the final
determination on the new SOBP.
   (D)   If no application is filed within the 45 days, the enterprise shall be
in violation of these regulations each and every day it continues to operate

upon confirmation of the identity of the applicant through the City Manager's
records.
      (1)   A replacement identification card number will be assigned to a
Class II enterprise.
      (2)   A replacement permit will expire on the same date as the original

the city until he or she obtains a replacement SOBP or card.
   (D)   A SOBP or card found in the possession of any person other than the

enterprise to negligently allow any person below the age of 18 years to remain
upon the premises or within the confines of the enterprise during the hours of
operation;

      (13)   For the owner or enterprise operator of a Class I enterprise to

§ 111.07 INVESTIGATION.
   During the time following the application for one or more peddler licenses
and its issuance, the City Police Department shall investigate as to the truth
and accuracy of the information contained in the application. If the city has
not completed this investigation within the 72 business hours provided in §
111.06, the identification card will nonetheless be issued, subject, however,
to administrative revocation upon completion of the investigation. If a
canvasser requests a peddler license, the investigation will proceed as
described above, but if the city refuses to issue the peddler license (or
revokes it after issuance), the canvasser will be advised that the failure to
procure a peddler license does not prevent him/her from canvassing the
residents of the city.

§ 111.08 DENIAL OF LICENSE AND REVOCATION OF LICENSE.

becomes disqualified for the issuance of a license under the terms of this
chapter.
   (B)   Notice. If the issuing officer denies (or upon completion of an
investigation revokes) the peddler license to one or more persons, he shall
immediately convey the decision to the applicant orally and shall within 16
working hours after the denial prepare a written report of the reason for the
denial which shall be immediately made available to the applicant.
   (C)   Appeal; hearing. The licensee shall have ten days from the date of
revocation or denial in which to file notice of his appeal to the City Council
from the order denying or revoking the license. The applicant shall have at his
option an appeal of the denial of his application or revocation of his license
before the City Council, at its next regular meeting. After holding the hearing
on the revocation or denial, the City Council shall by majority vote either
sustain the action or issue an order reinstating the license.
   (D)   In the event of the filing of an appeal from a revocation issued under
the provisions of this chapter, then, until such appeal has been determined by
the City Council, such revocation order shall be stayed.

§ 113.09 HOLDER OF MAJOR INTEREST IN DRILLING UNIT ENTITLED TO PERMIT.
   (A)   In the event an application for a permit for the drilling, completion,
and operation of a well for oil or gas shall be made by any person not owning
or not holding oil and gas leases or drilling contracts from the owners of all
lots, blocks, or parcels of land including in or embraced within a drilling
unit as shown upon the map attached to the ordinance codified herein, a permit
shall be issued to the applicant, and his or her heirs, successors, and
assigns, only upon the following conditions in addition to any other conditions
as may be provided in other sections of this chapter. The applicant shall be
free to enter into any contracts and agreements with the owners of the other
lots, blocks, or tracts as he or she may be able to make. If agreements are not
reached with all owners of lots, tracts, and blocks within the drilling unit,
then the owner or owners of any given lot or lots, block or blocks, or tract or
tracts shall have the right or option, by notice to the permittee given in
writing within 30 days after the issuance of a permit for a well on the
drilling unit involved, either:
      (1)   To treat his or her interest as a working interest and contribute
toward the actual cost and expense of drilling, completing, and operating the
well with all necessary appurtenances currently each month in the proportion
that the number of square feet in area owned by him or her in the drilling unit
bears to the number of square feet embraced in the unit, and thereupon receive
the same proportion of the oil produced and saved from the well or its value at
the well at the option of the permittee and a like proportion of natural as
produced, saved, and utilized or sold or the value of same at the well at the
option of the permittee; or
      (2)   To treat his or her interest as a royalty interest and receive,
delivered free of cost in the pipeline to which the well may be connected, a
share of all oil produced and saved from the well equal to one-eighth of the
proportion of the whole quantity of oil so produced and saved from the number
of square feet in the area owned by him or her bears to the number of square
feet in the drilling unit, or at the election of the permittee to receive the
proportion of the value at the well of the oil so produced, and to receive a
like proportion of the gas and casinghead gas produced, saved, and utilized or
sold, or at the election of the permittee the value at the well of the
proportion of gas or casinghead gas produced, saved, and utilized or sold.
   (B)   If any owner does not exercise the right and adoption above provided,
the obligation shall then be upon the permittee, his or her heirs, successors,
and assigns, to make settlement with the owner on the terms provided in
division (A)(2) above, providing for the payment of a one-eighth royalty. If
the owner of a lot or lots, block or blocks, or tract or tracts shall exercise
division (A)(1) above and treat his or her interest as a working interest, as
therein provided, the permittee shall be entitled to reimburse himself or
herself for the owner's proportionate part of the costs out of the owner's
proportionate part of the oil, gas, and casinghead gas or the value thereof
before making deliveries of products or settlement for the value thereof. If
division (A)(1) above is exercised by the owner of any lot or lots, block or
blocks, or tract or tracts, the owner shall, within the time provided for
notice of his or her election above set forth, file with the City Secretary a
bond or other obligation executed by the owner as principal and by an
authorized surety company as surety, in which the principal and surety agree,
bind, and obligate themselves to pay to the permittee, his or her heirs,
successors, and assigns, currently each month that proportion of the actual and
necessary costs and expenses involved in the drilling, completion and operation
of the well that the number of square feet embraced within the lot or lots,
block or blocks, or tract or tracts of the owner bears to the total of square
feet in the drilling unit, the bond to be approved by the Mayor and held by the
City Secretary for the benefit of the beneficiaries therein. Permits shall be
issued in all the cases upon the condition that the permittee, his or her
heirs, successors, and assigns, shall make settlement in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

bonds (totaling $200,000 in the aggregate) previously filed by permittee
hereunder. The bond filed by applicant shall be in the sum of not less than
$100,000, and shall run to the city, for the benefit of the city and all
persons concerned, conditioned that the permittee will comply with the terms
and conditions of this chapter in the drilling and operation of the well; that
the permittee will promptly restore the streets and sidewalks and other public
property of the city which may be disturbed or damaged in the operations to
their former conditions, as near as practicable; that the permittee will
promptly clear all premises of all litter, trash, waste, and other substances
used, allowed, or occurring in the drilling or producing operations, and will
grade, level, and restore the property to the same surface condition, as near
as practicable, as existed when operations for the drilling of the well were
first commenced; and that the permittee will pay to the owners of any
buildings, improvements, goods, or chattels located on the property any extra
cost of insurance of the property imposed by reason of the granting of the
permit, or the operations carried on thereunder, and that the permittee will
promptly pay and discharge any liability imposed by law for damages on account
of injury to property, either public or private, or bodily injury, including

drilling operations, production and maintenance of the well, equipment,
facilities, or appurtenances thereto; and that the permittee will indemnify and
hold the city harmless from any and all liability growing out of or
attributable to the granting of the permit. Any such bond filed by a permittee
hereunder shall become effective on or before the date filed with the City
Secretary and remain in force and effect until the expiration of the term of
the permit issued; subject, however, to the right of the surety company to
cancel same after 30-days written notice of the intention has been given to the
City Secretary, but the privilege of cancellation shall not affect any
liability which may have arisen hereunder up to the time the bond is actually
cancelled. Permittee in the event of cancellation of the surety bond above
provided for shall automatically suspend his or her right to operate under his
or her permit until the time as permittee shall furnish another bond as
required by this chapter. Each bond shall accrue to the benefit of any person
with reference to the conditions above stated and may be sued upon by him, her,
or them.
   (B)   If in accordance with the provisions of this section a permittee has
filed with the city two $100,000 surety bonds to cover the drilling and
operation of wells under this chapter, the permittee may drill and operate an
additional well or wells hereunder without filing any additional surety bond as
specified above, provided the permittee files with the City Secretary an
instrument (and obtains written approval thereof by the City Secretary) duly
executed by the surety company named as surety, in each of the permittee's
bonds on file with the city, agreeing that the bonds are in full force and
effect in the aggregate sum of $200,000 and that the terms and conditions of
each bond shall thereafter likewise apply to the drilling and operation of the
additional well or wells named therein.

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION
§ 150.65 CONSTRUCTION AND POST-CONSTRUCTION CONTROL MEASURES.
   It is the city's desire to reduce pollutants generated from construction
activities before, during, and after a project has been completed. All
construction activities shall be controlled in such a manner that reduces the
potential of pollutants, including dust and natural sediments from entering the
city's storm sewer system; from entering lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, gullies,
ravines, and other natural waterway courses; and from entering adjacent
properties. The methods listed in this title are intended to provide options in
which to accomplish these control measures.
(Ord. 17-1121, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 150.66 CONSTRUCTION PHASE CONTROL MEASURES.
   The following includes, but is not an exhaustive list of examples of
temporary pollution control measures that can be used to control erosion and
sedimentation:
   (A)   Structural controls.
      (1)   Silt fences may be utilized, where necessary, to retain the
sediments from disturbed areas within the site and decrease the velocity of
sheet flows.
      (2)   Straw bales may be utilized, where necessary, to retain sediments
from disturbed areas within the site and decrease the velocity of sheet flows.
Straw bales are particularly useful in paved areas where silt fences cannot be
erected.
      (3)   Stabilized construction entrances shall be designed to reduce the
amount of soil tracked off the construction site by vehicles leaving the site.
A stabilized construction entrance should be utilized, if necessary, to control
tracking. The responsible party shall ensure that vehicles entering and leaving
the construction site use the stabilized construction entrance. The owner or
operator of a vehicle entering or leaving a construction site may not track
soil off the construction site.
      (4)   Vegetative buffer strips, of appropriate size, should be
maintained, where necessary and practical, to aid in reducing the velocity of
stormwater and in trapping sediments in the stormwater leaving the site. A

shall be considered on its own merits on a case-by-case basis, and shall not be
construed to set a precedent for future requests.

subdivisions or areas within the city limits, which are not in permitted
manufactured home parks, include a preponderance of manufactured homes, not
including mobile homes, where the placement therein of an additional HUD-code
manufactured home will have no greater negative influence or impact on the
subdivision or neighborhood than already exists, the Building Official may
grant approval for the placement of the manufactured home.

support, the manufactured home.
(K) Vertical tie - A tie intended primarily to resist the uplifting and
overturning forces.
§ 80.54. Requirements for the Installation of Manufactured Homes.
(a)    When they are installed, all manufactured homes shall be installed by a
licensed installer to resist overturning and lateral movement of the home, and
the installation must be completed in accordance with instructions appropriate
for the Wind Zone where the home is to be installed as per one of the
following:
   (1)    the home manufacturer's DAPIA-approved installation instructions;
   (2)    the state's generic standards set forth in §§ 80.55, 80.56, 80.57,
and 80.58 of this title;
   (3)    the instructions for a stabilization system registered with the
Department in accordance with § 80.62 of this title (relating to Registration
of Stabilizing Components and Systems); or
   (4)    the instructions for a special stabilization system which;
      (A)    may or may not be a permanent foundation;
      (B)    is for a particular manufactured home or an identified class of
manufactured homes to be installed at a particular area with similar soil
properties according to county soil survey or other geotechnical reports; and
      (C)    is either:
         (i)    a pre-existing foundation for which a professional engineer or
architect licensed in Texas has issued written approval for the installation of
a particular home, and the written approval shall be submitted to the
Department with the installation report; or
         (ii)    installed in accordance with a custom designed stabilization
system drawing that is stamped by a Texas licensed professional engineer or
architect. A copy of the stabilization system drawing must be forwarded to the
Department along with the installation report.
(b)    When a home is installed on a stabilization system registered with the
Department or a special stabilization system, the installer must follow the
home manufacturer's DAPIA-approved installation instructions for any aspect of
the installation that is not covered by the system's installation instructions
or drawings.
(c)    The installer must use stabilizing components that have the required
capacity and install them according to the anchor or stabilizing component
manufacturer's current installation instructions. All stabilizing components
must be resistant to all effects of weathering including that encountered along
the Texas gulf coast. Nonconcrete stabilizing components and systems for use
within 1500 feet of the coastline shall be specifically certified for this use.
Preservation treated (PT) wood components shall conform to the applicable
standards issued by the American Wood Preserver's Association and referenced by
the latest edition of the International Residential Code.
(d)    Site Preparation Responsibilities and Requirements:
   (1)    A consumer acquiring a manufactured home to be installed, new or
used, is responsible for the proper preparation of the site where the
manufactured home will be installed except as set forth in § 80.57 of this
title (relating to Generic Standards for Moisture and Ground Vapor Controls):
   (2)    Whenever a licensed retailer intends to sell a manufactured home,
regardless of where it is located or is to be located, the retailer is required
to give the consumer the Site Preparation Notice, for signature by the
consumer, in the form set forth in § 80.260(a)(1) of this title (relating to
Required and Optional Forms) PRIOR to the execution of any binding sales
agreement.
   (3)    Whenever a licensed installer proposes to move a used manufactured
home, the installer is required to give the consumer the Site Preparation
Notice, for signature by the consumer, in the form set forth in § 80.260(a)(l)
of this title (relating to Required and Optional Forms) PRIOR to entering into
a binding agreement to move that home.
(e)    If at the time of installation or within 90 days thereafter as stated on
the contract, the retailer or installer provides the materials for skirting or
contracts for the installation of skirting, the retailer or installer is
responsible for installing any required moisture and ground vapor control
measures in accordance with the home installation instructions, specifications
of a registered stabilization system, or the generic standards and shall
provide for the proper cross ventilation of the crawl space. If the consumer
contracts with a person other than the retailer or installer for the skirting,
the consumer is responsible for installing the moisture and ground vapor
control measures and for providing for the proper cross ventilation of the
crawl space.
(f)    Clearance: If the manufactured home is installed according to the
state's generic standards, a minimum clearance of 18 inches between the ground
and the bottom of the floor joists must be maintained. In addition, the
installer shall be responsible for installing the home with sufficient
clearance between the I-beams and the ground so that after the crossover duct
prescribed by the manufacturer is properly installed it will not be in contact
with the ground. Refer to § 80.56 of this title (relating to Generic Standards
for Multi-Section Connections Standards) for additional requirements for
utility connections. It is strongly recommended that the installer not install
the home unless all debris, sod, tree stumps and other organic materials are
removed from all areas where footings are to be located.
(g)    Drainage: The consumer is responsible for proper site drainage where the
manufactured home (new or used) is to be installed unless the home is installed
in a rental community. It is strongly recommended that the installer not
install the home unless the exterior grade is sloped away from the home or
another generally accepted method to prohibit surface runoff from draining
under the home is provided. Drainage prevents water build-up under the home.
Water build-up may cause shifting or settling of the foundation, dampness in
the home, damage to siding and bottom board, buckling of walls and floors,
delamination of floor decking and problems with the operation of windows and
doors.
§ 80.55. Generic Standards for Anchoring Systems.
(a)    General Requirements: For units built on or after September 1, 1997, the
installer must verify that the unit is designed for the Wind Zone in which it
is to be installed and must follow all applicable installation instructions for
that Wind Zone as set forth herein. See figure in § 80.240(b)(l) of this title
for counties located in Wind Zone II. Note: A Wind Zone I unit, built on or
after September 1, 1997, may not be installed in a Wind Zone II area. However,
a Wind Zone II unit may be installed in a Wind Zone I area.
(b)    Material Specifications:
   (1)    Strapping shall be Type 1, Finish B, Grade 1 steel strapping, 1.25
inches wide and 0.035 inches in thickness, certified by a licensed professional
engineer or architect as conforming with the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) Standard Specification D3953 91, Standard Specification for
Strapping, Flat Steel, and Seals. Strapping shall be marked at least every five
feet with the marking described by the certifying engineer or architect.
   (2)    Tie materials shall be capable of resisting an allowable working load
of 3,150 pounds with no more than 2% elongation and shall withstand a 50%
overload (4,725 pounds total). Ties shall have a resistance to weather
deterioration at least equivalent to that provided by coating of zinc on steel
of not less than 0.30 ounces per square foot on each side of the surface coated
(0.0005 inches thick), as determined by ASTM Standards Methods of Test for
Weight of Coating on Zinc-coated (galvanized) Iron or Steel Articles (ASTM A
90-81). Slit or cut edges of zinc-coated steel strapping are not required to be
zinc coated. Ties shall be designed and installed to prevent self disconnection
when the ties are slack. For example, open end hooks shall have set screws or
other mechanisms to prevent disconnection when there is slack in the strapping.
   (3)    Anchor spacing ONLY applies to units with roof pitch of 20 degrees or
less. For anything over 20 degrees, it must be designed by a professional
engineer or architect.
(c)    Anchors shall be installed per the figures in § 80.240(b)(2) and (3) of
this title.
   (1)    in direction of load, see the Anchor Installation figure in § 80.240
(b)(2) of this title.
   (2)    installed against direction of load (vertical and/or angled), a
stabilizer plate must be installed. See Placement of Stabilizing Devices figure
in § 80.240(b)(3) of this title.
(d)    WIND ZONE I Installation:
   (1)    See the Wind Zone I Installation figure in § 80.240(b)(4) of this
title for the typical anchor layout, single and multi-section units (WIND ZONE
I ONLY).
   (2)    The table in § 80.240(a)(1) of this title describes the maximum
spacing for diagonal ties along each side of the unit.
   (3)    The table in § 80.240(a)(2) of this title describes the minimum
number of diagonal ties required per side, per unit length. Table based on 2
feet inset of anchors at each end. (4) When auger anchors cannot be inserted
into a difficult soil after moistening, such as mixed soil and rock or caliche
(heavily weathered limestone) that is not solid rock, cross drive rock anchors
may be used in accordance with the values and notes for the table in § 80.240
(a)(1) of this title modified as follows:
      (A)    Since the ultimate anchor pull out in the difficult soil will be
reduced, the maximum spacing for diagonal ties per side is one half the spacing
allowed by the table in § 80.240(a)(1) of this title which will require adding
one additional cross drive rock anchor for each anchor specified for the sides
and ends;
      (B)    The rods of the cross drive rock anchors must be fully inserted,
have at least 24 inches of the rod lengths embedded in the difficult soil, and
be restrained from horizontal movement by a stabilizer device between the rods
and the home; and
      (C)    Each cross drive rock anchor is connected to one diagonal tie and
is not connected to a vertical tie.
(e)    WIND ZONE II Installation:
   (1) I   n place of the requirements as shown in subsection (d) of this
section, units designed for Wind Zone I and built prior to September 1, 1997,
and units designed for Wind Zone II and built prior to July 13, 1994, require
diagonal ties as set forth in the table in § 80.240(a)(3) of this title when
these units are installed in Wind Zone II. See also § 1201.256 of the Standards
Act. Items not specifically addressed in this section are the same as for Wind
Zone I installations.
   (2)    Units built to Wind Zone II on or after July 13, 1994.
      (A)    Units built to Wind Zone II on or after July 13, 1994, should have
either built-in, or provisions for connecting, vertical ties along the sidewall
(s) of each unit(s). A diagonal tie must be installed at each vertical tie
location (except for designated shearwall tie). Built-in vertical ties shall be
connected to anchors. If there are brackets or other provisions for connecting
vertical ties, vertical ties shall be added at the brackets or provisions and
connected to anchors.
      (B)    Only factory installed vertical ties may be closer than 4 feet
from each other.
      (C)    Where tie locations are clearly marked as a shear wall strap, a
perimeter pier must be installed at that location. Diagonal tie is not
required.
      (D)    Where the vertical tie spacing exceeds 8'-0" on-center (see also
note 6 in the table in § 80.240(a)(3) of this title for exception), the
anchoring system must be approved by the home manufacturer's installation
manual, or designed by a professional engineer or architect licensed in the
state of Texas.
      (E)    Where pier heights exceed 36 inches in height, the diagonal strap
shall be connected to the opposite I-beam. See the Diagonal Strap Placement for
Piers Exceeding 36 inches in Height figure in § 80.240(b)(5) of this title.
      (F)    Where vertical tie locations are not easily discernable, the
vertical ties may be connected to the main I-beam rails and the anchor
installed directly below that connection point. The diagonal tie must be
connected to the opposite main I-beam. In no case shall the distance between
those ties exceed 5'-4" on-center. See the Diagonal and Vertical Ties figure in
§ 80.240(b)(6) of this title.
   (3)    Multi-section centerline anchoring requirements (Wind Zone II only):
      (A)    Centerline anchor ties are required for ALL Wind Zone II
installations, regardless of the date the unit was manufactured, when
installation occurs on or after the effective date of these rules.
      (B)    Factory installed centerline vertical ties, brackets, buckles or
any other connecting devices must be connected to a ground anchor. No
additional anchors as described in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph are
required.
      (C)    To avoid obstructions and/or piers and footers, the anchor may be

required of the person connecting the gas supply to the home, but may also be
performed by the gas utility or supply company. See the Fuel Gas Pipe Crossover
Connections figure in § 80.240(b)(21) of this title.
§ 80.57. Generic Standards for Moisture and Ground Vapor Controls.
(a)    If the manufactured home is installed according to the state's generic
standards and the space under the home is to be enclosed with skirting and/or
other materials provided by the retailer and/or installer, the enclosure must
meet the following requirements:
   (1)    At least one access opening that does not require the use of tools to
gain access shall not be less than 18 inches in any dimension and not less than
three square feet in area shall be provided by the installer. The access
opening shall be located so as to enable, to the extent reasonably possible,
the visual inspection of water supply and sewer drain connections.
   (2)    If a clothes dryer exhaust duct, air conditioning condensation drain,
or combustion air inlet is present, the installer must pass it through the
skirting to the outside.
   (3)    Crawl space ventilation must be provided at the rate of minimum 1
square foot of net free area, for every 150 square feet of floor area.
   (4)    At least six openings shall be provided, one at each end of the home
and two on each side of the home. The openings shall be screened or otherwise
covered to prevent entrance of rodents (note: screening will reduce net free
area). For example, a 16'x76' single section home has 1216 square feet of floor
area. This 1216 square feet divided by 150 equals 8.1 square feet or 1166
square inches of net free area crawl space ventilation.
(b)    The generic ground vapor control measure shall consist of a ground vapor
retarder that is minimum 6 mil polyethylene sheeting or its equivalent,
installed so that the area under the home is covered with sheeting and
overlapped approximately 12 inches at all joints. Any tear larger than 18
inches long or wide must be taped using a material appropriate for the sheeting
used. The laps should be weighted down to prevent movement. Any small tears
and/or voids around construction (footings, anchor heads, etc.) are acceptable.
(c)    Notice: The Site Preparation Notice form to be given to the consumer is
located in § 80.260(a)(1) of this title.
§ 80.58. Generic Standards for Footers and Piers.
(a)    Proper sizing of footings depends on the load carrying capacity of both
the piers and the soil. To determine the load bearing capacity of the soil, the
installer may use any of the following methods:
   (1)    Pocket penetrometer:
      (A)    Test a typical area adjacent to or within 10 feet of the perimeter
of the unit;
      (B)    Dig down to undisturbed soil. Each hole should be a minimum of 1
square foot surface area; and
      (C)    Using the pocket penetrometer take seven (7) readings, eliminate
the highest and the lowest and average the remaining five (5).
   (2)    Soil surveys from the U.S. Department of Agriculture;
   (3)    Values from tables of allowable or presumptive bearing capacities
given in local building codes. Such tables are commonly available from the
local authority having jurisdiction; or
   (4)    Any other test data from soil analysis reports.
(b)    The footing must be placed on firm, undisturbed soil, or fill compacted
to at least 90% of its maximum relative density. Installation on loose,
noncompacted fill may invalidate the home's limited warranty.
(c)    See the Footer Configurations figure in § 80.240(b)(22) of this title.
(d)    Footer sizing and capacities: The Footer Capacities table in § 80.240(a)
(8) of this title represent maximum loads and spacings based on footer size and
soil bearing capacity. Other footers may be used if equal or greater in bearing
area than those footer sizes tabulated.
(e)    Piers and pier spacings: Spacing and location of piers shall be in
accordance with the tables listed in § 80.240(a)(9) and (10) of this title.
   (1)    Spacing shall be as even as practicable avoiding obstacles that are
not in control of the installer along each main I-beam. Pier spacing may exceed
tabulated values up to 30% so long as the total pier count remains the same.
End piers are to be located within 24 inches of the end of the main frame.
   (2)    Piers shall extend at least 6 inches from the centerline of the I-
beam or be designed to prevent dislodgment due to horizontal movement of less
than 4 inches.
   (3)    Load bearing supports or devices shall be registered with the
Department in accordance with § 80.62 of this title (relating to Registration
of Stabilizing Components and Systems).
   (4)    Sidewall openings greater than 4 feet shall have perimeter piers
located under each side of the opening, i.e. patio doors, recessed porches/
entries, bay windows and porch posts. Perimeter piers for openings are not
required for endwalls.
(f)    Pier design: Piers shall be constructed per the details in the Pier
Design figure in § 80.240(b)(23) of this title.
   (1)    Shimming (if needed): Shims are commonly used as a means for leveling
the home and filling any voids left between the bottom flange of the I-beam and
the top of the pier cap. Wedge shaped shims must be installed from both sides
of the I-beam to provide a level bearing surface. The allowable height must not
exceed 1 inch. Shims shall be a minimum of 3 inches wide and 6 inches long.
   (2)    See the table in § 80.240(a)(9) of this title for the pier loads
(pounds) at tabulated spacings WITHOUT perimeter supports.
   (3)    See the table in § 80.240(a)(10) of this title for pier loads
(pounds) at tabulated spacings WITH perimeter supports and the Perimeter Pier
Front and Side View figure in § 80.240(b)(24) of this title.
(g)    See the Typical Multi-Section Pier Layout figure in § 80.240(b)(25) of
this title.
(h)    See the Typical Single Section Pier Layout figure in § 80.240(b)(26) of
this title.
(i)    Multi-section units mating line column supports:
   (1)    On multi-section units, openings larger than 4 feet must have piers
installed at each end of the opening. To determine the pier loads, refer to the
table in § 80.240(a)(ll) of this title. See the Determining Column Load and
Marriage Line Elevation figure in § 80.240(b)(27) of this title.
   (2)    Column loads for each section may be combined when the columns are
opposite each other. The footer must be sized for the combined loading.
   (3)    Additional piers are required under marriage walls (see wall between
column #3 and #4 in the Marriage Line Elevation figure in § 80.240(b)(27) of
this title. The maximum spacing is the same as the spacing at the main I-beams,
without perimeter piers, and one half the spacing of the perimeter piers, with
perimeter piers installed.
   (4)    See the table in § 80.240(a)(ll) of this title for the mating line
column loads.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Tex. Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Willis, Texas does ordain as
follows.
(Ord. 14-0715, passed 7-15-2014)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 14-0715, passed 7-15-2014)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 14-0715, passed 7-15-2014)
§ 153.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 14-0715, passed 7-15-2014)

   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
(iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.

tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. See AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. (For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. No. 97-348)),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond  the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, which is principally above ground, as
well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions
or (2) Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see § 60.6 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)
(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time
as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.

§ 153.28 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Appeal Board, as established by the community, shall hear and
render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
   (C)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
153.27(B) above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (§
153.03).
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in
divisions (A) through (I) above are met, and (ii) the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 153.40 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   (A)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   (B)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 14-0715, passed 7-15-2014) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has
been provided as set forth in §
153.07, §
153.26(H), or §
153.42(C), the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated a minimum of 18 inches above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this division as proposed
in §
153.27(A)(1), is satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of
18 inches above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be designed so that below a depth of 18 inches above the
base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or
review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and
shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this division. A record of
such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by
the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject
to flooding shall be provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a
community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated such that the bottom of the structural supporting I-beam is 18
inches above the established base flood elevation or three feet above highest
adjacent grade if no base flood elevation is established; and anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM be elevated on
a permanent foundation such that the bottom of the structural supporting I-beam
is 18 inches above the established base flood elevation or three feet above
highest adjacent grade if no base flood elevation is established; and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   (E)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on
the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and
ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of §
153.27(A), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes
in division (D) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (F)   Appurtenant Structures. New construction of appurtenant structures or
substantial improvements to appurtenant structures shall have the lowest
finished floor elevated a minimum of 18 inches above the base flood elevation;
or shall be "wet flood proofed" in accordance with NFIP Technical Bulletin 7-
93.
   (G)   Fill in an Area of Special Flood Hazard. Any fill placed in an area of
special flood hazard shall be mitigated such that there is a zero rise in the
base flood elevation, and no adverse impacts to surrounding properties.

   (A)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with §§
153.02,
153.03 and
153.04 above.
   (B)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Floodplain
Development Permit requirements of §§
153.08,
153.27, and the provisions of §§
153.40 et seq. of this chapter.
   (C)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals

§ 153.43 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
153.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable,
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of 18
inches above the base flood elevation or a minimum of 18 inches above the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM; or a minimum of three feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified on the
community's FIRM.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of 18
inches above the base flood elevation or a minimum of 18 inches above the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM; or a minimum of three feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified on the
community's FIRM; or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below a depth of 18 inches above the base specified flood depth in an
AO Zone, or below a depth of 18 inches above the Base Flood Elevation in an AH
Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
153.27.
   (D)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.

153.99
§ 153.44 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
153.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development other than bridges, culverts,
and similar improvements within the adopted regulatory floodway. For bridges,
culverts, or other similar encroachments it shall be demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (B)    If division (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
153.40 et seq.
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Ch. 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the
provisions required by § 65.12.

order and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court
order or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500 (as limited by Texas state law) for each
violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the
case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

with applicable city ordinances.
      (3)   The city shall receive all the fees; and the City Secretary shall
certify and receipt all the fees in triplicate. The City Secretary shall retain
two copies for the city files and one copy shall be furnished to the applicant.
   (D)   Effect of approval ofplans and plats.
      (1)   Staff review. No plans and/or plats of any part or at any stage of
a proposed subdivision shall be reviewed or approved by the City Council until
the plat and/or plan has been reviewed by the City Director of Community
Development, City Director of Public Works, City Engineer and City Planning and
Zoning Commission. The City Director of Public Works and City Engineer shall
submit their recommendations concerning each stage of any plans or plans in
writing to the City Director of Community Development. The City Director of
Community Development shall then submit his or her recommendations in writing
to the City Secretary for submission to the City Planning and Zoning
Commission. Upon approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the plat and/
or plan shall be submitted to the City Council for review and approval.
      (2)   Preliminary plan. Upon approval of the preliminary plan by the City
Council, three signed and dated copies thereof shall be executed by the
Council. One copy shall be retained in the permanent files of the City
Secretary, one copy to the City Director of Community Development's office for
its file, and one copy to the developer of the subdivision for his or her file.
Approval of the preliminary plan by the Council shall not be construed as final
acceptance nor approval of the subdivision but merely indicates general
concurrence with the layout and proposals contained therein. Plan approval
does, however, authorize the developer to proceed with “rough” cutting of
streets only if he or she so chooses; and encourages the developer to proceed
with the preparation of final construction drawings and specifications required
for the development of the subdivision; and to proceed with the preparation of
the final plat.
      (3)   Short form and final plats. Any short form subdivision plat
submitted in which public utilities are already in place and drainage
provisions have been made shall be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for its approval and then to the City Council for its approval and
signatures. Distribution of signed and approved short form plats shall be the
same as for final plats. No sale of any lot within the subdivision may be
consummated until final plat has been approved by the city and duly filed in
the County Clerk's office. Four signed and dated copies shall be executed by
the City Mayor, attested by the City Secretary, and dated thereof. When the
plat has been approved by the Council and signed by the Mayor, the City
Secretary shall be directed to cause the plat and supporting documents thereof
to be filed in the County Clerk's office within 15 days of the authorization.
The City Secretary shall then retain one signed copy with street address
numbers in its permanent engineering files, retain one copy for the City
Council's file and placement on the city's official base map, and one copy to
the subdivider for his or her file. All final plats shall be substantially in
accord with the previously approved preliminary plan of the subdivision. The
final plat shall be submitted for approval by the city within one year of the
date the preliminary plan of the subdivision was approved by the Council,
otherwise approval of the preliminary plan shall be deemed null and void and
the developer will be required to resubmit a preliminary plan. The Council may,
however, grant a reasonable extension of time to the developer for submitting
the final plat beyond the one-year period, upon written request and
justification thereof by the developer.
      (4)   Building permit. No building permit shall be issued on any land
forming any part of a subdivision unless the applicable provisions of this
chapter have been complied with as well as all other applicable ordinances of
the city referring to building permits and the plat has been filed of record.
   (E)   Enforcement. In addition to other remedies provided by law, the city
and its officers shall have the right to enjoin any violation of these
regulations by injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (F)   Changes on preliminary plan or final plat when resubmitting. The
developer and qualified professional land planner, landscape architect, civil
engineer, or land surveyor trained and experienced in land subdivision design,
are to document (on a separate sheet) and sign any changes on any preliminary
or final plats when resubmitting them to the City Council. Any supporting
documents shall be noted with the name and address of the person preparing
them.

REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
§ 154.20 GENERAL TYPE AND CHARACTER OF PLANS AND PLATS TO BE SUBMITTED.
   (A)   Preliminary plan.
      (1)   Purpose. The preliminary plan is intended to indicate all planning
factors and considerations necessary to enable the city to determine whether
the proposed plan for land development or redevelopment is satisfactory from
the standpoint of the public interest. The plan, related supporting documents,
and the review thereof are intended to produce a subdivision design in which
all applicable planning factors have been recognized and reconciled; as
distinguished from a final plat in which the engineering factor of dimensional
precision is the predominant objective.
      (2)   Plan preparation. The preliminary plan drawing shall ordinarily be
prepared by a qualified professional land planner, landscape architect, civil
engineer, or land surveyor trained and experienced in subdivision design.
Accompanying legal instruments and attendant documents shall ordinarily be
prepared by a qualified professional attorney at law trained and experienced in
those matters. Six copies of the preliminary plan, applicable filing fees and
supporting documents shall be filed with the City Secretary not less than 21
days before a Council meeting is held thereon by the Council.
      (3)   Type and scale of plan drawing. The preliminary plan shall be drawn
in ink on reproducible Mylar, tracing linen, or tracing vellum with all
information shown thereon enclosed by heavy border line. The plan drawing scale
shall be one inch equals 100 feet, provided that, when special conditions
warrant, a smaller or larger scale may be accepted when prior approval of the
City Secretary has been obtained. The plan and supporting documents shall
contain the information prescribed in §
154.21.
   (B)   Final plat.
      (1)   Purpose. The final plat is that instrument which, along with its
related supporting documents, becomes the official accurate, permanent record
of the subdivision of land. It shall substantially conform to the preliminary
plan as approved by the Council and may include all or only a portion of the
approved preliminary plan. No final plat may be recorded in the office of the
County Clerk until the plat shall first have been approved by the Council; and
no lot or parcels within the subdivision may be sold or conveyed until the plat
therefor has been approved and duly recorded in the County Clerk's Office.
      (2)   Plat preparation. The final plat drawing shall ordinarily be
prepared by a registered land surveyor duly licensed by the state, who may
legally certify as to the accuracy thereof. Accompanying legal instruments and
attendant documents shall ordinarily be prepared by a qualified professional
attorney at law authorized to practice in the state. Six copies of the final
plat, applicable filing fees and supporting documents shall be filed with the
City Secretary not less than 21 days before a review and approval by the
Council.
      (3)   Type of scale of plat drawing. The final plat shall be drawn in ink
on reproducible Mylar, tracing linen, or tracing vellum with all information
shown thereon enclosed by a heavy border line. The plat drawing scale shall be
one inch equals 100 feet. The plat drawing and supporting documents shall
contain the necessary information prescribed in §
154.22.
      (4)   Plat size. Plat size overall is to be as required by the County
Clerk.
      (5)   Approval. After final approval and proper endorsement have been
obtained and all requirements of these regulations have otherwise been complied
with the plat, all other instruments may be recorded. No changes, erasures,
modifications, or revisions shall be made in any plat of a subdivision or to
any required instrument after approval has been given to the plat and endorsed
on the plat, in writing, unless the changes, modification, or revision are

proposed physical environment embraced by the subdivision, require the
subdivider/applicant to prepare an environmental assessment in accordance with
the policies and provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(Pub. L. No. 91-910), being 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., and as hereafter may be
amended. The Council may require the assessment be prepared any time prior to
or during the Council's review of the preliminary plan, but if required, the
assessment shall be placed on file and available to the Council, and general
public prior to any final decision rendered on the plan.

§ 154.23 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to reflect the character and quality of
development envisioned by the city to be in the best interests of the citizens
of this city, both present and future, and to ensure that the long-term effects
of development which take place in current times will not become a burden upon
the general public in the future. The standards expressed in this section are
established to provide streets of adequate right-of-way width, alignment, and
traffic capacity to prevent or at least minimize traffic hazards and
congestion, to provide adequate space for the disposal of storm waters and to
establish adequately sized lots, tracts, or parcels of land where residential
and other types of building structures may be constructed without creating
hazards to the health, safety, and well-being of the occupants of the
structures.
   (B)   Obviously, each parcel of land within the city may have unique
physical or topographical features which may make an absolute application of
the design standards contained herein unfeasible and if those conditions exist
and can be substantiated, the City Council has provided, under §
154.50 , procedures necessary to secure a variance from these standards.
(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019)
§ 154.24 STREETS; GENERAL INTENT.
   (A)   Generally.  The street system of any city account for about one-third
of the land within the city and is the only system through which access and
most of the services required in the use of private property must flow. The
design of the street network of any city is, therefore, very important to the
success and viability of the community and it is the intention of the City
Council through the application of its policies and standards, that the
continued expansion of the street system of this community will not impede
access or the flow of services to private property, create hazards, or cause
unnecessary traffic congestion.
   (B)   Minimum standards for improvement of streets and roads.

§ 154.25 PUBLIC STREETS.
   (A)   General arrangement and layout.  The public street system pattern
proposed within any subdivision plat or development should be based upon the
following design concepts:
      (1)   Provide the adequate vehicular access to all properties within the
subdivision plat boundaries;
      (2)   Provide adequate street connections to adjacent properties to
ensure adequate traffic circulation within the general area;
      (3)   Provide a local street system serving properties to be developed
for residential purposes which discourages through traffic while maintaining
sufficient access and traffic movement for convenient circulation within the
subdivision and access by firefighters, police, and other emergency services;
and
      (4)   Provide a sufficient number of continuous streets and major
thoroughfares, particularly in those areas designed for the development of
high-density multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial land uses, to
accommodate the increased traffic demands generated by these land uses.
   (B)   Major thoroughfares.
      (1)   Location and alignment.  The location and alignment of designated
major thoroughfares must be in general conformance with the latest edition of
the major thoroughfare and freeway plan adopted by the city. Proposals which
constitute a change in the location or alignment of any designated major
thoroughfare or freeway illustrated on this plan may be approved by the City
Council if public benefit is substantiated.
      (2)   Right-of-way; widening; transitions.  The minimum width of the
right-of-way to be dedicated for any designated major thoroughfare should not
be less than 100 feet. In those instances where the plat is located adjacent to
an existing designated major thoroughfare having a right-of-way of less than
100 feet, sufficient additional right-of-way must be dedicated to accommodate
the ultimate development of the major thoroughfare in question on the basis of
a total right-of-way width of 100 feet. Where the construction of concrete
pavement with curbs, gutters, and storm sewers is not feasible and open ditch
drainage is planned, the minimum right-of-way width required for the
development of a designated major thoroughfare must be more than 100 feet and
of sufficient width to accommodate the approved roadway pavement, attendant
drainage facilities, and utilities. In those instances where it is proposed to
extend an existing major thoroughfare having a right-of-way width of 80 feet,
the right-of-way to be dedicated for the extension of this major thoroughfare
should be increased through a transitional area from 80 feet in width to 100
feet in width over a distance of 200 feet. Similar transitional areas will be
required where other existing right-of-way widths are encountered.
      (3)   Curves and intersections.  Curves proposed for the right-of-way of
designated major thoroughfares must have a centerline radius of 2,000 feet or
more. Exceptions to this requirement may be considered by the Council upon
receipt of a request from the subdivider for a variance as provided herein. In
no instance, however, will the Council grant a variance indicating the
centerline radius of any designated major thoroughfare to be less than 1,150
feet. Reverse curves should be separated by a tangent distance of not less than
100 feet. Intersections with other public streets should be at right angles,
except in those instances where the subdivider requests a variance as provided
for herein. Where acute angle intersections are approved, however, a radius of
at least 25 feet in the right-of-way line at the acute corner must be provided.
   (C)   Local streets.
      (1)   Location and alignment.  The location and alignment of local public
streets proposed to be dedicated and established with a subdivision or
development plat should be designed in conformance with the concepts listed in
division (A) above.
      (2)   Right-of-way width; widening.  The width of the right-of-way to be
dedicated for any public street not designated as a major thoroughfare or
freeway must be at least 60 feet, except as provided below. In those instances
where a subdivision plat is located adjacent to an existing public street, the
street not being designated as a major thoroughfare, having a right-of-way
width less than 60 feet, sufficient additional right-of-way must be dedicated
within the subdivision plat boundary to accommodate the ultimate development of
the subject street to a total right-of-way width of not less than 60 feet. A
right-of-way width of 55 feet may be provided when the street is not designed
to be extended into properties outside the plat boundaries, has an ultimate
length not to exceed 800 feet as a cul-de-sac or when in the configuration of a
loop having an internal block length of less than 1,000 feet, where storm
sewers are to be provided and where the adjacent properties being platted are
subdivided into lots, designed for residential purposes, having a lot width at
the right-of-way line of less than 40 feet.
      (3)   Curves and intersections.  Curves along local streets may have any
centerline radius, except that the centerline radius on a reverse curve may not
be less than 300 feet. Reverse curves should be separated by a tangent distance
of not less than 50 feet. Intersections with designated major thoroughfares
should be at right angles, except in those instances where the subdivider
requests a variance as provided for herein. Where acute angle intersections are
approved, however, a radius of at least 25 feet in the right-of-way line at the
acute corner must be provided.
      (4)   Cul-de-sac right-of-way radii.  The radii of the right-of-way at
the end of local streets terminated with a circular cul-de-sac turnaround must
be at least 50 feet.
      (5)   Dead-end streets.  Dead-end streets will not be approved except in
those instances where the street is terminated by a circular cul-de-sac
turnaround or where the street is designed to be extended into adjacent
property.

§ 154.26 PUBLIC ALLEYS.
   (A)   General arrangement and layout.  Public alleys may be provided within
any subdivision plat to provide secondary vehicular access to lots which
otherwise have their primary access from an adjacent public street or approved
common or compensating open space or courtyard which is adjacent to a public
street and where the public streets and alleys are to be served by storm
sewers. Public alleys may not be used or designed to provide the principal
access to any tract of land and may not provide any access to property outside
the subdivision plat boundaries in which the alleys are dedicated.
   (B)   Right-of-way width; intersections; curves.  Public alleys must have a
right-of-way width of not less than 20 feet. Intersections with public alleys
or public streets must be at right angles, except in those instances where the
subdivider requests a variance as provided for herein. All corners at the
intersection of alley right-of-way with public streets or other alleys must
have at least a 25-foot radius or 15-foot angular cutbacks provided. Curves in
alleys should be kept to a minimum and should have a centerline radius of not
less than 300 feet. Reverse curves in alleys should be separated by a tangent
distance of less than 50 feet.
   (C)   Dead-end alleys.  No dead-end or cul-de-sac alleys will be permitted.

§ 154.28 PRIVATE STREETS.
   (A)   Generally.  The city will review and consider all development projects
where private streets are proposed to be developed which would provide access
to any residential building or dwelling unit, or any part thereof, which is
located more than 300 feet from the nearest public street to which the private
street intersects. The city will review and consider any proposed project where
a private street is intended to serve four or more separate lots or individual
building sites designed for sale to the general public for residential
purposes. Parking lots and aisles within the parking lots and private driveways
within shopping centers, institutions, and commercial and industrial
developments are required to be approved by the city.
   (B)   General arrangement and layout.  The pattern or layout of the street
system in any project should provide for the following basic design concepts:
      (1)   Provide adequate vehicular access to all buildings and facilities
within the plat boundaries;
      (2)   Provide adequate interior traffic circulation and access to all
buildings containing dwelling units by firefighting personnel and equipment;
      (3)   Provide adequate access to the existing public street system
adjacent to the boundaries of the plat and; and
      (4)   Be so designed to allow for the smooth flow of vehicular traffic,
avoiding traffic hazards such as closely off-set intersections, angular and
multiple point intersections, jogs, and other design features which would
induce a hazard to vehicular traffic and the occupants of the project.
   (C)   Width.  Since private streets are established without the benefit of a
formalized right-of-way width, the width of a private street is considered by
the city to be the width of the surface of the pavement measured from edge to
edge. Under these circumstances, the right-of-way width and the pavement width
of a private street are considered coterminous and the terms are used
interchangeably. It is the policy of the city that the minimum acceptable
unobstructed width of any private street should not be less than 28 feet. If
parallel parking is proposed along the private street, additional width may be
required to accommodate the parking.
   (D)   Dead-ends, cul-de-sacs, and T-type turnarounds.  Dead-end private
streets must be terminated by a circular cul-de-sac having a paving radius of
not less than 50 feet or a T-type turnaround designed in conformance with the
standards approved by the Fire and Public Works Departments.
   (E)   Length of cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets.  Dead-end private streets
must not extend further than 300 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting public or private street measured along the centerline of the
private street to the center of the circular turnaround (cul-de-sac) or the
outer limit of the paving in the T-type turnaround configuration.
   (F)   Intersections.  In those instances where a private street intersects
with a public street paved with dual roadways and esplanade, the private street
should be located at an established esplanade opening. Private streets must not
be direct (straight line) projections of any public street, except in those
instances where:
      (1)   The extension is at an intersection with a public street paved with
dual roadways and esplanade; and
      (2)   Where the private street is two separate 20-foot (minimum) roadways
separated by a minimum 20-foot curb section at the public street intersection
and the private street is not a direct connection (straight line) between two
public streets. In those instances where the private street is not a direct
extension of a public street, then the private street must offset a minimum
distance of 125 feet centerline to centerline from any public street
intersection. Intersections of all private streets must be at right angles with
variations not to exceed ten degrees. Right angle intersections of private
streets must have a 20-foot radius at all corners. Acute angle intersections
must have 25-foot radii at the acute corner on both public and private streets.
   (G)   Multiple access points to public streets.  All projects containing
private streets must have a private street system so designed to provide
adequate emergency vehicular access and the private street system must be
designed to provide more than one point of access to the project or development
from the public streets adjacent to the boundaries of the project or
development in those instances where it is the opinion of the Fire Chief that
additional access points will be necessary to ensure the safety and general
welfare of the public and occupants of the project.

§ 154.29 STREET NAMES.
   (A)   Public streets.  All public streets contained in any subdivision plat
or development plan approved by the city must be named in conformance with the
following considerations.
      (1)   New street names, not extensions of existing names, must not be
duplicates of any existing street name located within the city or its exclusive
extraterritorial jurisdiction.
      (2)   Existing street names must be used in those instances where a new
street is a direct extension of an existing street or a logical extension (when
the streets in question are not and cannot be physically continuous) thereof
except in those instances where the existing street name is a duplicate street
name.
      (3)   Street name suffixes such as court, circle, and loop should be
designated on streets which are cul-de-sacs or in a configuration of a loop
street. Suffixes such as boulevard, speedway, parkway, and expressway should be
confined to designated major thoroughfares or local streets designed to handle
traffic volumes in excess of normal neighborhood traffic generation. Suffixes
such as highway or freeway must be used only to designate highways or freeways
falling under the jurisdiction of the State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation.
      (4)   Street name prefixes such as north, south, east, and west be used
to clarify the general location of the street; however, the prefixes must be
consistent with the existing and established street naming and address
numbering system of the general area in which the street is located.
      (5)   Alphabetical and numerical street names must not be designed on any
subdivision plat or development plan except in those instances where the street
is a direct extension of an existing street with such a name and is not a
duplicate street name.
   (B)   Private streets.  Street names will not be approved on any private
street, driveway, or access easement shown on any plat submitted to the city
for approval.

§ 154.30 BLOCK LENGTHS.
   (A)   Measurement criteria.  Block lengths are to be determined by the
measurement along the face of a block (being the adjacent street right-of-way
line) from one street intersection to another street intersection where the
streets provide cross-traffic circulation (not cul-de-sac street). In those
instances where a loop street configuration is involved the interior block
formed by the loop streets is measured through the center of the block and
between adjacent street right-of-way lines. Variations in the block lengths
herein specified may be considered by the city upon receipt of a request from
the subdivider for a variance and in those situations where a block may be
adjacent to a major topographical feature, such as a river, canal, bayou,
gully, ravine, a major drainage ditch, lake, pit, or mine excavation; a major
right-of-way or easement for high voltage electrical transmission lines,
underground pipelines, railroad rights-of-way, and facilities; designated
freeways; a public park or other publicly owned and operated facilities such as
dams, reservoirs, schools, airports, or golf courses and; privately owned golf
courses and lakes when the golf courses and lakes are an integral part of the
layout and subdivision design of the overall tract being developed. In no
instance, however, will the Council grant a variance indicating that a block
adjacent to the conditions and features mentioned above to be more than 2,640
feet (one-half mile) in length measured along the block face.
   (B)   Major thoroughfares.  The maximum length for blocks adjacent to
designated major thoroughfares must not be more than 1,800 feet.
   (C)   Local streets.  The maximum length for blocks adjacent to local
streets must not be more than 1,000 feet, except under the following
circumstances.
      (1)   Loop streets may have an internal block length of not more than 800
feet.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs may have a block length of not more than 800 feet,
measured from the intersection with the right-of-way of a cross street along
the center line of the cul-de-sac street to the center of the circular
turnaround at the end of the cul-de-sac.
      (3)   Stub streets or dead ends may have a block length of no more than
800 feet unless terminated with a circular turnaround suitably modified to
accommodate future extension of street into adjacent property.
   (D)   Private streets.  See §
154.28(E) regarding the length of cul-de-sac or dead-end private streets.

§ 154.31 ONE-FOOT RESERVES.
   In those instances where any public street is established in a plat
submitted to the city and where the public street forms either a stub street
into adjacent acreage or where the public street lies along and parallel with
the plat boundary and adjacent to acreage, a one-foot wide reserve must be
established within the street right-of-way to form a buffer strip, dedicated to
the public, between the public street right-of-way and the adjacent
unsubdivided acreage to prevent access to this public street from the adjacent
unsubdivided acreage unless and until the city has had an opportunity to review
the development proposals for the adjacent acreage and a plat of the adjacent
property is duly recorded. The conditions associated with the establishment of
a one-foot reserve on a plat are contained in the following notation which must
be placed upon the face of any plat where a one-foot reserve is to be
established:
“One-foot reserve dedicated to the public in fee as a buffer separation between
the side or end of streets where such streets abut adjacent acreage tracts, the
condition of such dedication being that when the adjacent property is
subdivided in a recorded plat, the one-foot reserve shall thereupon become
vested in the public for street right-of-way purposes and the fee title thereto
shall revert to and revest in the dedicator, his heirs, assigns, or
successors.”

public interest to locate a public street right-of-way centered on a property
line. The Council will not approve a partial or half street dedication within a
subdivision dedicating less than a 50-foot right-of-way width on a designated
major thoroughfare or less than a 30-foot right-of-way width on any other type
public street. Appropriate notations and one-foot reserve must be placed upon
the plat restricting access from any partial or half streets so dedicated to
adjacent acreage tracts until the adjacent property is subdivided in a recorded
plat and the additional adjacent right-of-way is acquired providing the full
right-of-way widths as specified in this chapter.

easements established with a plat which is designed to accommodate public owned
or controlled utility facilities necessary to provide various types of utility
services to the individual properties within the plat boundaries. Public
utility easements may be used for, but not limited to, facilities necessary to
provide water, electrical power, natural gas, telephone, telegraph, and
sanitary sewer services. Storm sewers or open drainage ways must not be
constructed within public utility easements unless specifically approved by the
City Director of Public Works and where additional easement width is provided
to conform to the standards established herein for drainage easements.
      (1)   Location.  Public utility easements must be provided along the
front of all lots designed for the development of a structure containing
residential dwelling units and in such other locations as determined to be
necessary by the City Director of Public Works and worked out with the owner or
developer and any other utility companies involved. Public utility easements
located along the outer boundaries of a plat must contain the full width
required for the easement except in those instances where the adjacent property
is within a portion of a previously approved plan and under the same ownership
as the property being platted or where additional easement width is dedicated
by separate instrument by the owner of the adjacent tract. In those cases, one-
half of the required easement width is dedicated by separate instrument by the
owner of the adjacent tract. In those cases, one-half of the required easement
width may be dedicated within the plat boundary with the other half provided
outside the plat boundary by separate instrument or through notation on the
plat certifying the ownership and dedication of the easement.
      (2)   Public utility easement widths; dead ends.  All public utility
easements established within any subdivision plat must not be less than ten
feet in width to accommodate a single utility line, and not less than 16 feet
in width to accommodate two or more utility lines. In those instances where
underground electrical facilities are to be installed within the public utility
easement, the easement width must not be less than 16 feet in width. Additional
width may be determined to be necessary by the City Director of Public Works
and worked out with the owner or developer and any other utility companies
involved based on the proposed or future utilities to be contained within the
easement. No dead-end public utility easements will be permitted by the city.
   (B)   Drainage easements.  All drainage easements must be located and
dedicated to accommodate the drainage requirements required for the proper
development of the property within the subdivision boundaries and within its
natural watershed and in conformance with the requirements of the City Director
of Public Works and other governmental agencies charged with the responsibility
of storm drainage or flood control within the area the subdivision is located.
A suitable note on the plat must restrict all properties within the subdivision
ensuring that drainage easements within the plat boundaries shall be kept clear
of fences, buildings, plantings, and other obstructions to the operations and
maintenance of the drainage facility and abutting property shall not be
permitted to drain directly into this easement except by means of a drainage
structure approved by the City Director of Public Works or other authorized
public drainage or flood control official.
   (C)   National Flood Insurance Program.  The city and the county, as well as
other county units of government, have agreed to participate in the National
Flood Insurance Program and, through this participation, the limits of the 100-
year flood plain for all natural drainage ways has been determined and special
regulations for construction of facilities which fall within the designated
100-year flood plain have been established. It is the policy of the city to
inform persons who submit plats to the city if the property illustrated on the
plat falls within the established flood plain and to suggest that they seek
more detailed information from the agencies who control construction in these
areas.
      (1)   Existing easements; fee strips.  All easements or fee strips
created prior to the subdivision of any tract of land must be shown on the
subdivision plat of the land with appropriate notations indicating the name of
the holder of the easement or fee strip, the purpose of the easement and
generally the facilities contained therein, the dimensions of the easement or
fee strip tied to all adjacent lot lines, street rights-of-way, and plat
boundary lines and the recording reference of the instruments creating and
establishing the easement or fee strip. In those instances where easements have
not been defined by accurate survey dimensions such as “over and across” type
easements, the subdivider should request the holder of the easement to
accurately define the limits and location of his or her easement through the
property within the plat boundaries. If the holder of the undefined easement
does not define the easement involved and certifies his or her refusal to
define the easement to the city the subdivision plat must provide accurate
information as to the center line location of all existing pipelines or other
utility facilities placed in conformance with the easement holder's rights and
building setback lines must be established 15 feet from and parallel with both
sides of the center line of all underground pipelines or pole lines involved.
      (2)   Establishment of special use easement.  The establishment of
special use utility easements may be provided on a subdivision plat when the
easement is for the purpose of accommodating a utility facility owned,
operated, and maintained by a unit of government and is restricted to either
water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, or for drainage purposes and where
it has been determined by the City Director of Public Works that these
facilities cannot or should not be accommodated within a general purpose public
utility easement or public street right-of-way. Easements proposed to be
established for any private utility company or private organization providing
utility services and restricted for their exclusive use cannot be shown on or
established by a subdivision plat, however, the private utility facilities can
be accommodated and placed within the general purpose public utility easements,
public streets, and alleys established within the plat boundary. Nothing
herein, however, may prevent the private utility companies from granting and
establishing special or exclusive use easements by separate instrument if the
arrangements are deemed necessary to properly serve the properties within the
plat boundaries.

154.99
§ 154.35 BUILDING SETBACK RESTRICTION.
   (A)   Generally.  Building setback restrictions have traditionally been
required by the city in various degrees dependent upon the type and design
characteristic of the streets which the restrictions parallel. These
restrictions are designed and applied to assure that occupied buildings,
particularly residential and commercial buildings where a concentration of
people is involved, are located a sufficient distance away from the adjacent
street to avoid damage to the structure and occupants by errant vehicles, to
lessen or minimize the effect of noise and pollutants generated by traffic on
the occupants of adjacent buildings, to ensure that the location of buildings
do not create any traffic hazard by blocking or restricting lines of sights,
particularly at intersections and along curves, to provide some additional open
space in addition to the space within the street right-ofway for the free
movement of police, firefighters, and others in emergency situations, and when
appropriate sufficient yard space and open space separating building structures
which may enhance the visual character and value of a particular development.
Building setbacks shall be established and maintained as provided herein and
shall in no case be less than the building setbacks established in the city
zoning regulations found in
Chapter 155.
   (B)   Major thoroughfares.  Properties adjacent to designated major
thoroughfares must have a front building setback from the adjacent major
thoroughfare right-of-way of not less than 25 feet. When the lot sides on a
major thoroughfare, a side building setback of at least 20 feet must be
provided. In those instances where such a lot backs on a major thoroughfare, a
rear building setback of not less than ten feet will be required.
   (C)   Local streets.  Properties adjacent to local streets must have a front
building setback from the adjacent street right-of-way of not less than 25
feet. When the lots side on a local street, a side building setback of 15 feet
must be provided. When the lots back on a local street, a rear building setback
of ten feet must be provided.
   (D)   Building setback line off-sets and transitions. In those instances
where the required building setback restriction line changes from one tract to
another, a transitional building setback line must be provided having a minimum
angle of 45 degrees. The transition must take place on the lot or tract having
the lesser building setback restriction requirement.
   (E)   Pipelines; railroad rights-of-way. Where underground pipelines
carrying flammable products under pressure through properties within a plat
boundary or where properties within the plat back or side along a railroad
right-of-way, a 15-foot building setback restriction must be provided adjacent
to the pipeline easement or fee strip (or the center line of the pipeline
facility if no easement is defined) or railroad right-of-way line.
(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 13-1119A, passed 11-19-2013; Ord. 19-
1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see §
154.99
§ 154.36 RESERVE TRACTS.
   (A)   Generally.  Reserve tracts are those individual parcels of land
created within a subdivision plat which are not divided into lots, but are
established to accommodate some specific purpose such as a commercial center,
industrial sites, a golf course, or other type of private recreational
facility, schools or church sites or sites for utility facilities such as water
wells and storage areas, wastewater treatment plants, electrical power
stations, or other activities and land uses which division into lots is not
suitable or appropriate. Since the use or reserve tracts may not be completely
determined by the subdivider or developer at the time plats are prepared and
submitted to the city, these reserve tracts are often established as
“unrestricted reserves” which allows maximum flexibility in the determination
of the ultimate use planned for the properties.
   (B)   Public street access. Reserves established on any subdivision plat
must have frontage on and be immediately adjacent to at least one public
street, with the frontage being not less than 60 feet in width. In those
instances where the average depth of an unrestricted reserve is more than 300
feet, the reserve access to all adjacent public streets must be separated by a
one-foot reserve placed within the adjacent street right-of-way as provided for
in § 154.31 which will become automatically removed upon the approval and
recording of a suitable development plat of the property within the reserve.
   (C)   Identification and designation.  All reserves must be labeled and
identified on the plat and a description of the use intended for the reserve
must be noted. If the use of the reserve is not restricted for any specific
use, the reserve must then be identified and noted as being unrestricted. All
reserves are to be identified and designated by alphabetical letters, not
numbers, along with an indication as to the total acreage of the reserves must
be shown within each reserve boundaries.

§ 154.37 LOTS; GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Generally.  The purpose of this section is to provide general overall
guidelines for the establishment of individual lots within subdivisions
designed to accommodate various types of residential housing schemes without
resorting to more specific and detailed standards strictly associated with a
particular housing type or market label which may be associated with a
subdivision of land containing lots designed to be offered for sale to the
general public.
   (B)   General lot design; arrangement layout.  The general lot design within
any subdivision should be based upon the concept that the lots are created and
established as undivided tracts of land and that purchasers of the lots can be
assured that these tracts of land meet the following basic criteria.
      (1)   The lot is of sufficient size and shape to allow the construction
of a residential dwelling unit which can meet the requirements of established
building or construction codes, housing and public health codes, and ordinances
and accepted family living standards.
      (2)   The lot is of sufficient size and shape to accommodate easement for
all public and private utility services and facilities to adequately serve any
residential dwelling unit constructed thereon.
      (3)   The lot is of sufficient size and shape and is so located that
direct vehicular access is provided from a public street or through an approved
permanent access easement and that the required number of vehicles can be
parked on the lot without encroachment within any adjacent public street or
alley rights-of-way.
   (C)   Lot shapes.  Lots should be designed, so far as possible, with side
lot lines being at right angles or radial to any adjacent street right-of-way
line. Where all lots are either perpendicular and at right angles or radial to
adjacent street rights-of-way, a suitable notation may be placed upon the plat
in lieu of lot line bearings.
   (D)   Key or flag lots.  Key or flag lots may be permitted under unusual
circumstances; however, the narrowest part of such a lot, being the staff
portion of the flag lot, must not be less than 20 feet in width or have a
length of more than 200 feet. The lot must also be restricted to prevent the
construction of any building, structure, wall, or fence within the staff
portion of the lot and that the staff portion of the lot will be restricted for
access to such lot only. The restrictions must be shown on the face of the
subdivision plat in the form of a notation or a part of the dedicatory language
on the plat.
   (E)   Double-front lots.  Double-front lots will not be approved except in
those instances where lots are restricted for residential use and back up on an
adjacent designated major thoroughfare or where special circumstances would
warrant a variance to this regulation.
   (F)   Street access limitations.  Rear and side vehicular driveway access
from lots, restricted for the construction of residential dwelling units, to
adjacent streets designated as major thoroughfare, freeway, highway or any
other public street which carries a traffic volume where additional vehicular
driveways would create a traffic hazard or impede the flow of traffic, will not
be approved and the access restriction must be noted directly upon the plat and
adjacent to the lots in question.
   (G)   Lot and block identification.  All blocks established in any
subdivision shall be designated by number with the numbers being consecutive
within the whole subdivision plat. Lots established within the blocks shall
also be numbered with the numbers being consecutive within the block. Lot
numbering may be cumulative throughout the subdivision if the numbering system
continues from block to block in a uniform manner.
   (H)   Minimum lot sizes; general provisions.
      (1)   Non-residential uses.  Lots to be established in any subdivision
plat which are designed or intended for nonresidential uses or are intended to
be unrestricted, must have a minimum lot area of not less than 5,000 square
feet and must have frontage along and adjacent to at least one public street
having a right-of-way width of not less than 60 feet. If the lots or tracts
proposed to be established and designated as lots, but must be established and
designated as reserves and subject to those provisions of this chapter
pertaining to reserves in §
154.36.
      (2)   Residential uses.
         (a)   Radial lots, being those lots adjacent to curved streets or
circular cul-de-sacs, must have a width at the front property line equal to the
minimum width for lots specified herein.
         (b)   Corner lots must be ten feet wider than the average interior
lots within the block and where the corner lots are located at the intersection
of a local street and designated major thoroughfares must be 20 feet wider than
the average interior lot within the block.
         (c)   When lots are backing on a natural drainage way (bayou, creek,
gully, and the like) an open drainage facility or other encumbrances, the lots
must have a depth sufficient to provide at least 80 feet from the drainage
easement line or encumbrances boundary to the front building setback line or
front property line if no building setback restriction is required.
         (d)   When lots are facing or backing on a designated major
thoroughfare the lots must have a depth at least ten feet deeper than the
average depth of lots within the interior of the subdivision having frontage on
local streets.
         (e)   The minimum lot area for lots must not be less than 60 feet wide
and 100 feet deep or have less than 7,000 square feet area. Under special
conditions, provided for herein, the lot area and street accessibility
conditions herein provided may be modified if specifically approved by the City
Council. (See division (I) below.) Two off-street parking spaces must be
provided on or adjacent to each lot with the width of the spaces being not less
than eight and one-half feet each and that the spaces cannot be in tandem.
   (I)   Minimum lot sizes; special conditions.  To accommodate various types
of unique and innovative housing forms which are usually based upon a concept
of reducing the area of individually owned lots and grouping the lots together
to more efficiently utilize the total space within the subdivision by creating
common open spaces, scenic and recreational areas, and other spaces which would
compensate for the reduction of land area contained within the individually
owned lot, the following standards have been developed and applied to a variety
of the housing forms including, but not limited to townhouses, town homes,
patio homes, courtyard homes, planned unit developments, cluster homes, or any
other designation of whatever nature. All other provisions contained in this
manual are applicable to these types of housing forms unless specifically noted
herein.
      (1)   Street access.  In general, all lots shall have frontage and be
adjacent to at least one public street having a right-of-way of not less than
60 feet. Lots containing an area less than 3,500 square feet may have frontage
on a public street, may have frontage upon an approved common courtyard or
common open space having frontage on a public street or may have frontage upon
a private street which connects with a public street. In these instances where
the special lot is to be established without direct frontage along an adjacent
public street, the lots must be part of a unified development scheme where the
owners' association, corporation, or other organization as one of its purposes
the continued care and maintenance of all commonly owned properties within the
subdivision, particularly the areas established as private streets. Proof of
establishment of the legally binding restrictions and obligations must be
provided to the city prior to the recording of any plat containing any lots not
having frontage along an adjacent public street.
      (2)   Reduced lot area; width.  Lots proposed to be established under
these special conditions must be sanitary sewered lots and may have a gross
area of not less than 1,400 square feet with a minimum width not less than 18
feet. Two off-street parking spaces must be provided on or adjacent to each lot
with the width of the spaces being not less than eight and one-half feet each
and that the spaces cannot be in tandem.
      (3)   Compensating common open space required.
         (a)   In those instances where the proposed lot has a gross area of
less than 7,000 square feet, compensating common open space must be established
and provided within the plat boundary and based upon the following schedule:
Compensating Opening Space Requirements (Lots Less Than 5,000 Square Feet in
Area)
Average Area of Lots (Square Feet) Compensating Open Space Required Per Lot
                                   (Square Feet)
Compensating Opening Space Requirements (Lots Less Than 5,000 Square Feet in
Area)
Average Area of Lots (Square Feet) Compensating Open Space Required Per Lot
                                   (Square Feet)
1,400 to 2,000                     720
2,001 to 2,500                     600
2,501 to 3,000                     500
3,001 to 3,500                     400
3,501 to 4,000                     300
4,001 to 4,500                     200
4,501 to less than 7,000           100
 
         (b)   In no instance, however, will the compensating open space
contained within any subdivision having special lots be less than 21,780 square
feet (one-half acre) or shall the compensating open space required be in excess
of 25% of the gross area of the property within the plat boundary exclusive of
any public street rights-of-way involved. This does not apply to subdivisions
having special lots and containing less than ten acres. Subdivisions having
special lots and containing less than ten acres must, however, provide
compensating open space in accordance with the schedule. If a plat containing
lots requiring compensating open spaces is less than ten acres, but is a part
of a larger tract, being planned and developed as an overall design, the city
may take in consideration the overall development scheme in the determination
of compensating open space requirements provided for herein.

§ 154.38 COMPENSATING OPEN SPACE; GENERALLY.
   (A)   Generally.  Compensating open space required to be established when
lots are proposed to be created with areas less than 7,000 square feet is
necessary to provide some space for children to play outdoors within their
immediate neighborhood or block which will allow them an opportunity to play
catch, basketball, fly a kite or glider, ride a tricycle, skate, use small
scale playground equipment which may be provided, and other activities normally
accommodated in the front or back yard of the typical suburban home. Without
this compensating open space, the only alternative for the children to play in
areas where yard space has been eliminated, for all practical purposes by a
reduction in the lot area, is the street adjacent to their home. Obviously,
this is a very hazardous situation and directly affects the quality of life in
these neighborhoods. Compensating open space also allows the individual housing
units and lots to be grouped in a manner which creates economics in the
installation of utilities and streets required to serve these individual
private properties and provides an opportunity for the subdivider to design and
develop a more attractive residential neighborhood and fully utilize any
natural or topographic features which may be present on the tract being
subdivided.
   (B)   Limitations; courtyards.
      (1)   Compensating open spaces are to be considered to be only those
areas not specifically designated or used as lots, building sites for dwelling
units, building sites for utility or storage purposes, vehicular parking lots,
carports or garages or driveways thereto, or streets either public or private.
These properties must be restricted for the exclusive use of owners within the
subdivision and owned, managed and maintained under a suitable binding
agreement among the property owners. Compensating open spaces may remain
undeveloped or landscaped and may be developed for recreational purposes (both
active or passive) and can be used to provide courtyard access from groups or
clusters of lots adjacent to public streets.
      (2)   Compensating open spaces used as courtyards which are designed to
provide primary access from groups or clusters of lots or building sites
adjacent to public streets must have an average width between the fronts of the
lots or buildings of 25 feet with a minimum of the distance being not less than
20 feet. The length of the courtyards should not be more than 200 feet (about
66.5 yards) extending away from the public street which the courtyards must
open onto.
   (C)   Greenbelt areas within any multi-family residential complex.
      (1)   Definition of greenbelt area. A GREENBELT AREA shall consist of
open earthen areas bearing trees, shrubbery, or grass. Sidewalks, tennis
courts, swimming pools, and the like shall not be considered a part of a
GREENBELT AREA.
      (2)   Requirement. Any plan for the multi-family residential complex
shall provide for a greenbelt area equal to 20% of a total living area on all
floors of the complex. At least 10% of the required greenbelt shall be evenly
distributed within the complex. The remaining percentage of greenbelt may be
developed as a park within the complex.
      (3)   Disclosure on plans.  The site plan of any complex shall distinctly
show the location of the required greenbelt areas.

§ 154.39 MINIMUM DWELLING UNIT SIZE.
   All dwelling units shall contain a minimum gross square footage of living
area defined as the dimensions measured from interior wall to interior wall
(exclusive of garages, carports, storage rooms, and the like) for each type as
follows:
   (A)   Single-family detached dwelling unit: 1,000 square feet; and
   (B)   Single-family dwelling unit (apartments, townhouses, and the like):

§ 154.40 BUILDING LAYOUT; FIRE HYDRANT LOCATION.
   (A)   Fire hydrants shall be properly located on public property right-of-
way at a spacing not to exceed 300 feet in commercial areas and 600 feet in
residential areas and in accordance with the standards established by the State
Board of Insurance and the State Department of Health.
   (B)   All buildings proposed to be constructed within any project containing
private streets must be so arranged and located that firefighting apparatus can
park and reach any part of any building with a 200-foot long hose extending
from the equipment. This 200-foot hose length must be measured as the hose is
laid on the ground and may not be measured as the aerial radius from the parked
equipment. In addition, fire hydrants must be so located and provided within
the project boundaries so that 500 feet of fire hoses, extending on the ground
from the hydrant, can reach the furthermost part of any building within the
boundaries of the plat. Entrances to all buildings containing residential
dwellings must be illustrated on the plat of any project containing private
streets.

§ 154.41 BUILDING DESIGN; FIRE WALKWAY.
   All buildings proposed to be constructed within any project containing
private streets and which contain residential dwelling units and have an
overall length of 300 feet or more, must be so designed to have one or more
open, unobstructed walkways through the building at ground level, having a
width of not less than five feet each to allow ready access by firefighters and
police officers and their equipment and other emergency services to each side
of the buildings. In those instances where buildings are to be constructed over
and across any private street, the unobstructed overhead clearance must not be
less than 14 feet, measured between the highest point of the private street
paving under the structure and the lowest part of the building structure or
associated parts thereof and suitable restrictions to this condition must be
noted on the plat.

§ 154.42 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Generally.  The following represents the policy of the city in
projects which are required to be submitted to it.
   (B)   Residential.
      (1)   All plats or building sites established in any subdivision plat or
any development plan containing private streets intended for the construction
of residential dwelling units must be so restricted to provide street right-of-
way in conformance with the following schedule. The size of off-street parking
spaces must be in conformance with the standards approved by the city.
 
Type of Structure             Number of Parking Spaces
Efficiency                    1 parking space
1-bedroom                     1 parking space
2-bedroom                     1-1/2 parking spaces
3-bedroom                     2-1/2 parking spaces
Planned unit development lots 2 parking spaces per dwelling unit within or
                              adjacent to each lot
Single-family detached        2 parking spaces
 
      (2)   The parking spaces required above must not be in tandem and all
parking spaces must be illustrated and dimensioned. Parking space arrangement,
sizes of spaces and driveway and openings must be in conformance with the
standards adopted by the city.
   (C)   Multi-family residential complexes.  All plats or building sites
providing for multi-family residential units shall provide two parking spaces
per living unit. For every ten parking spaces for a complex, one additional
parking space shall be required for guest parking.
   (D)   Non-residential. T he following schedule of minimum off-street parking
requirements shall apply to all nonresidential construction, new or
structurally altered, within the city:
      (1)   Rooming or boarding house: one parking space for each sleeping
room;
      (2)   Church or temple: one parking space for every four seats in the
main auditorium;
      (3)   School (except high school or college): one parking space for every
four seats in the auditorium or main assembly room, or two spaces for each
classroom, whichever is greater;
      (4)   High schools: one parking space for every four seats in the main
auditorium or seven spaces for each classroom, whichever is greater;

§ 155.002 PURPOSE.
   The zoning regulations and districts established in this chapter have been
made in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the
health, safety and general welfare of the City of Willis, Texas, and its
inhabitants. Such regulations and such districts have been designed to lessen
congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers;
to facilitate adequate provisions of transportation, particularly in times of
natural disaster when timely evacuation is critical for the protection of
lives; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land;
to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate adequate
provisions of water, sewage, schools, parks and other public requirements. They
have been made with reasonable consideration of the character of the City and
its suitability for particular uses, and with a view of conserving the value of
buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city.

by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants
or other agreements between parties; however, where this chapter imposes a
greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of
a building, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by
other ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants or agreements,
the provision of this chapter shall govern.

is made a conforming use. Otherwise, such uses shall remain nonconforming uses
where recognized, or an illegal use, as the case may be. It is further the
intent and declared purpose of this chapter that no offense committed, and no
liability, penalty or forfeiture, either civil or criminal, shall be discharged
or affected by the adoption of this chapter; but prosecutions and suits for
such offenses, liabilities, penalties or forfeitures may be instituted or
causes presently pending be proceed in all respects as if such prior chapter
had not been repealed.

(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009)
§ 155.130 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Abandonment. Under this chapter a nonconforming use may be abandoned
subject to the following:
      (1)   Determination. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure in a
district that is discontinued or remains vacant for a continuous period of six
months shall be presumed to be abandoned and shall not thereafter be
reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the structure or
land site must conform with the regulations for the district in which it is
located. This subsection shall not apply to the residential use of a
nonconforming dwelling unit in the "NC" "GC", or "GI" districts.
      (2)   Overcoming presumption of abandonment. The presumption of
abandonment may be rebutted upon showing, to the satisfaction of the Building
Official, that during such period the owner of the land or structure has been:
         (a)   Maintaining the land and structure in accordance with the
building code and did not intend to discontinue the use;
         (b)   Actively and continuously marketing the land or structure for
sale or lease for that particular nonconforming use; or
         (c)   Engaged in other activities that would affirmatively prove there
was not intent to abandon.
      (3)   Calculation of period of abandonment. Any period of such
discontinuance caused by government action, fire or natural calamities and
without any contributing fault by the nonconforming user shall not be
considered in calculating the length of discontinuance pursuant to this
section.
   (B)   Movement, alteration and enlargement. No nonconforming use may be
moved, enlarged or altered and no nonconforming use of land may occupy
additional land, except as follows:
      (1)   Enlargement. A nonconforming use may not be enlarged, expanded or
extended to occupy all or a part of another structure or land site that it did
not occupy on the effective date of the provisions of this chapter. However, a
nonconforming use may be extended within the same structure, provided no
structural alteration of the structure is proposed or made for the purpose of
the extension. The enlargement, expansion or extension of a nonconforming
residential use shall be excepted from this limitation, provided that the
enlargement, expansion or extension does not exceed fifty (50) percent of its
appraised value as it existed prior to the enlargement, expansion or extension;
it was not destroyed to the extent of 50% or more; and, it complies with all
other regulations, e.g. height, setbacks, etc., for the property on which it is
located.
      (2)   Exterior or interior remodeling or improvements to structure.
Exterior or interior remodeling or improvements to a structure containing a
nonconforming use shall be allowed, provided there is no expansion of the
nonconforming use.
      (3)   Relocation of structure. A structure containing a nonconforming use
may not be relocated to another site unless the use shall conform to the
regulations of the district into which the structure is relocated.
      (4)   Change of nonconforming nonresidential use to another nonconforming
use. Upon application to the Building Official, a nonconforming use may be
changed to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type or intensity
or to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type, but of less
intensity. Whenever any nonconforming nonresidential use is changed to a less
intensive nonconforming nonresidential use, such use shall not be changed back
to a more intensive nonconforming nonresidential use. Whenever any
nonconforming nonresidential use is changed to a conforming use, such use shall
not later be changed to a nonconforming use.

§ 155.131 NONCONFORMING MOBILE HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   Mobile homes lawfully existing and occupied within the city prior to the

allowed; provided, however, mobile homes or manufactured homes heretofore
installed in compliance with city ordinances, being properly permitted
thereunder, utilized continuously as a residence, and being connected to all
utilities, may be replaced with newer model manufactured homes, subject to the
requirements of this chapter and other applicable law. In the event of such
replacement, documentation as to the use and connection to utilities must be

§ 155.134 EXTERIOR MASONRY CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   It is the city's desire to promote building longevity and architectural
creativity by requiring a certain percentage of masonry construction on
building exterior walls. The masonry guidelines set forth in this chapter are
intended to provide a minimum standard for the exterior construction of certain
buildings.
   (A)   Calculating masonry percentage. Where this chapter specifies a minimum
percentage of masonry construction, that percentage shall be calculated by
considering the entire surface area of the specified wall(s) less any and all
glazing, windows, and doors. The percentage shall be calculated from the
remaining surface area after subtracting the area of any and all glazing,
windows, and doors.
   (B)   Structures inherent to specific zoning designations. The percentage of
masonry required on a structure shall be governed by the masonry requirements
for the zoning designation that the structure is specifically inherent to,
i.e., the masonry requirements for a single-family residential home built in a
non-residential zoning designation shall be governed by the requirements for
the residential zoning designation, not the non-residential designation.
   (C)   Placement of required masonry. Upon determination of the minimum
required amount of masonry construction, the designer may at the designer's
discretion design the structure such that any of the exterior walls are
constructed with a percentage of masonry, provided the sum of the masonry on
all of the exterior walls is equal to the total required percentage of masonry
as calculated.
   (D)   Exemptions. The following structures are exempt from the masonry
requirements of this chapter:
      (1)   Accessory structures 200 square feet or less; or accessory
structures not visible from a public right-of-way;
      (2)   Any building that is situated 350 feet or more from the public
right-of-way(s) that border the parcel;
      (3)   Temporary portable classrooms installed on public school grounds;
      (4)   Manufactured homes; modular homes; and recreational vehicles.
   (E)   Variances. 
      (1)   Exceptions to this section requirements may be considered by the
City Council, as applicable, based only on the following:
         (a)   Architectural design and creativity;
         (b)   Compatibility with surrounding developed properties;
         (c)   Other extenuating circumstances.
      (2)   In granting any variance, the City Council shall determine that a
literal enforcement of the regulations will create an unnecessary hardship or
practical difficulty on the applicant; that the situation causing the
unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty is unique to the affected property
and is not self-imposed; that the variance will not injure and will be wholly
compatible with the use and permitted development of adjacent properties; and
that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the spirit and
purpose of the ordinance.
   (F)   Nonconforming buildings. 
      (1)   Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of the
adoption or amendment of this section and said building could not be built
under the terms of this section, it may continue so long as it remains lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
         (a)   Such a building may not be enlarged by more than 25% of its
existing foundation footprint unless the entire building is brought into
conformity with the masonry requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   The exterior walls of such a building may not be modified,
altered, or enlarged in a way which increases its nonconformity unless the
modification, alteration, or enlargement is in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.
      (2)   Should a nonconforming building be destroyed by any means to an
extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it
may be rebuilt to the same footprint exempt from the masonry requirements
provided a building permit for the reconstruction is secured within 90 days of
the destruction of the original structure.

follow the center lines of streets or highways, the street center lines arc
construed to be the boundaries;
   (B)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow lot lines, the lot lines are construed to be the boundaries;
   (C)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to street center lines or street right-of-way lines, such district
boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance
therefrom as indicated on the map. If no distance is given, such dimension
shall be determined by the use of the scale on the map or by the ordinance
establishing the district boundaries;
   (D)   On unsubdivided land or when a district boundary follows no
identifiable feature, the location of district boundaries shall be determined
by the ordinance establishing the district boundaries or by using the map scale
appearing on the map, unless the district line is indicated by dimensions
printed on the map, in which case the printed dimensions shall control;
   (E)   Where streets or alleys on the ground differ from streets or alleys
shown on the map, the streets or alleys on the ground control; and
   (F)   The Building Official shall interpret the district boundaries in cases
of conflict or question.

PARKING REGULATIONS
§ 155.170 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   At the time any building, use, or structure is erected, enlarged,
structurally altered, or converted from one use to another which requires an
increase in the number of parking space, off-street parking spaces shall be
provided in accordance with these regulations for the use of occupants,
employees, visitors and patrons. Where off-street parking facilities are
provided in excess of the minimum amounts specified by this article, or when
off-street parking facilities are provided but not required, said off-street
parking facilities shall comply with the minimum requirements for parking and
maneuvering space as specified in this subchapter.
   (B)   Off-street parking facilities shall be maintained and continued as
long as the building, use or structure is continued. No person shall utilize
such building, use or structure without providing the required off-street
parking facilities. In addition, it shall be unlawful to discontinue or
dispense with, or cause the discontinuance or reduction of, the required
parking facilities apart from the discontinuance of the building, use or
structure, without establishing alternative off-street parking facilities,
which meet these requirements.
   (C)   All required off-street parking, ingress to, egress from, and
components thereof shall be constructed of either asphalt or concrete in
accordance with engineering best practices. All non-required parking or paving
that is not constructed of either asphalt or concrete shall have controls in
place to minimize dirt, dust, or mud from leaving the site.

§ 155.171 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   An off-street parking space shall not be in a street or alley right-
of-way. Each off-street parking space shall be permanently reserved for the
temporary storage of one automobile and connected with a street or alley that
affords unobstructed ingress and egress to each space.
   (B)   Each parking space shall be accessible from a street or alley through
aisles and/or driveways, except that tandem parking arrangements are permitted
for single-family, two-family and manufactured home residential uses. With the
exception of the above residential uses on local and collector streets, off-
street parking facilities shall be so arranged that in order to depart from the
premises it shall not be necessary that any automotive vehicle be backed into
any public street right-of-way.
   (C)   Circulation within a parking area with more than one aisle shall be
such that a vehicle need not enter the street in order to reach another aisle
within the same parking area. Dead-end aisles are not permitted for parking
spaces with angles greater than zero degrees and less than ninety 90 unless
adequate turnarounds are provided. All circulation and maneuvering of vehicles
shall occur without encroaching any right-of-way or adjacent property, except
in the case of joint parking facilities.
   (D)   All parking spaces shall be clearly marked on the pavement with yellow
or white traffic paint, curbs, or raised pavement markers approved by the city.
Traffic control signs or other pavement markings shall be used as necessary to
ensure safe and efficient traffic operation. The provisions of this paragraph
shall not apply to a single-family dwelling.
   (E)   Placement, signing, and markings for fire zones shall be approved by
the city's Building Official.
   (F)   A parking lot shall be designed to physically prevent any portion of a
vehicle from encroaching or overhanging any public right-of-way line or private
property line through the installation of a permanent curb, wall, or other
physical barrier.

§ 155.172 JOINT PARKING FACILITIES.
   Required off-street parking for any number of separate uses may be combined
in a joint parking facility under the conditions of this section, subject to
the approval of a joint parking facility plan by the Building Official. Such
joint parking facility plan shall be reviewed by the Building Official for
conformance with this section.
   (A)   Joint parking facilities permitted. Whenever two or more uses are
located together in a common building, shopping center, or other integrated
building complex, the parking requirements may be complied with by providing a
permanent, common parking facility, cooperatively established and operated,
which contains the requisite number of spaces for each use. The joint parking
facility shall be located within 300 feet from all uses, and shall not be
separated from such uses by arterial streets. The total number of spaced
provided shall not be less than the sum of the individual requirements for all
uses, unless otherwise permitted in these regulations. Spaces provided for any
permanent residents of dwellings shall be clearly designated and separated from
spaces provided for employees, customers and service.
   (B)   Multiple ownerships and structures. Where buildings, uses or
structures participating in a joint parking facility are owned by multiple
owners, each owner shall provide evidence of a permanent, legal instrument,
approved by the City Attorney, which guarantees such owner's rights to the use
of the parking facility. Any termination of or amendment to such an agreement
shall be subject to the approval of the city.
   (C)   Churches. Churches may establish joint parking facilities with other
uses that do not have a time conflict in parking demand. However, only 50% of a
church's required parking spaces may be provided in this manner. In addition,
such joint parking facilities shall be located no more than 400 feet from the
church sanctuary.
   (D)   Guarantee. Joint parking facilities shall guarantee the permanency of
the joint use and maintenance through an appropriate legal instrument, approved
by the City Attorney, and filed of record.

§ 155.173 COMPUTATION OF THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required, the following rules
govern:
   (A)   Service areas such as mechanical rooms, attics, and closets are
excluded from the calculation of floor area for determining required parking
spaces.
   (B)   Where fractional spaces result in computing required parking spaces,
the required number of spaces must be increased to the nearest whole number.
   (C)   The parking space requirements for a use not specifically listed shall
be the same as those for the most similar to the proposed use, as determined by
the Building Official.
   (D)   Whenever a building or use constructed or established after the
effective date of this chapter is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of
employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, to create a
need for an increase of 10% or more in the number of existing parking spaces,
such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change.
Whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective date of this chapter
is enlarged to the extent of 50% or more in floor area or in the area used,
said building or use shall then and thereafter comply with the parking
requirements set forth herein.
   (E)   In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal the
sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
   (F)   Where requirements are established on the basis of the number of
seats, such requirements shall be based on the seating capacity permitted by
the building and/or fire code and approved by the city's Building and Fire
Officials. When determining seating capacity for a building, use, or structure
utilizing bench seating, each 22 inches of bench shall be considered one seat.
   (G)   Where a manufacturing/industrial use has more than one working shift
of employees, parking facilities shall be adequate to accommodate overlap
requirements during transition periods.
   (H)   When the developer of a large-scale development can demonstrate that
such development will require fewer parking spaces than required by the
standards of this chapter, the Building Official may permit a reduction in the
number of required parking spaces for the development. Such a reduction in
parking spaces shall be justified through the development of a parking study
prepared by a professional traffic engineer or transportation planner and
submitted to the Building Official. The balance of the land necessary to meet
these requirements shall be held in reserve as an undeveloped area, to meet any
future needs generated by an expansion of the business, a change in land use,
or underestimated parking demand.

§ 155.191 SIZING.
   Sizing of inlets, storm sewers, outfalls, culverts and drainage ditches
within a subdivision/development shall be based on the following and the latest
revision (as of the adoption of this ordinance) of the Montgomery County
Drainage Criteria Manual:
   (A)   Design storm. An interior drainage system will be designed for a storm
with a frequency of occurrence of once in five years, occurring under fully
developed conditions.
   (B)   Runoff computation. The determination of runoff rates shall be in
accordance with the latest revision (as of the adoption of this ordinance) of
the Montgomery County Drainage Criteria Manual.
   (C)   Sewer. A sewer shall be sized to carry the discharge (Q) derived from
the rational formula. The capacity of storm sewers shall be determined by the
use of the Mannings formula on the basis of hydraulic gradients, rather than
the physical slope of the pipe. The minimum storm sewer size shall be 18
inches. The minimum downstream tailwater shall be the top of pipe or the 25-
year water surface elevation in the receiving water body, whichever is greater.
   (D)   Inlets. Inlets shall be spaced so that the maximum travel distance of
water in gutters will not exceed 400 feet for residential streets and 300 feet
for major thoroughfares. Inlets will be provided at all low points in gutter
gradients. Inlets will be sized using the latest revision (as of the adoption
of this ordinance) of the Montgomery County Drainage Criteria Manual.
   (E)   Ditches. Ditches shall be sized to carry the runoff, derived from the
rational formula with appropriate velocities. The use of roadside ditches must
be approved by the City prior to the start of design.
(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009; Ord. 19-1022B, passed 10-22-2019)
§ 155.192 DESIGN.
   The design of storm sewers, outfalls, culverts and drainage ditches within a
subdivision shall conform to the following:
   (A)   Manholes. Manholes, inlets or junction boxes shall be provided at all
changes in grades or alignment, sewer intersections, street intersections and
at a maximum of 500 feet on straight lines. Manhole design and detail shall
follow acceptable engineering practices. Manholes shall be constructed of
reinforced concrete only.
   (B)   Pipe or storm drain.
      (1)   The pipe or storm drain shall be constructed of reinforced concrete
pipe (RCP), high-performance polypropylene pipe (HP or PP), HDPE pipe, or as
specified by the City Engineer, and shall be sized as shown on the approved
plans. Pipe shall be a minimum of 18 inches or larger in diameter. Concrete
pipe shall be reinforced ASTM C-76, class 3. High-performance polypropylene
pipe shall be dual-wall, shall meet or exceed the requirements of ASTM F288 l
and AASHTO M330, and shall be installed in conformance with section 12 of the
AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and section 30 of the AASHTO LRFD
Bridge Construction Specifications. HDPE pipe shall be made from virgin
polyethylene and comply with the requirements for test methods, dimensions, and
markings found in AASHTO Designations M252, M294, and MP7-97.
      (2)   Pipes shall have a minimum cover of not less than one foot over the
top of the pipe or in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's specifications,
whichever is greater. When added strength of pipe is needed for traffic loads,
excessive height of backfill, or cover of less than one foot due to
uncontrollable constraints, reinforced concrete pipe meeting ASTM C-76, class 4
or 5, or high-performance polypropylene pipe with comparable strength
properties and expected life span under similar design loads shall be used.
Data demonstrating the strength characteristics, design life, or other
information about the selected pipe materials and their appropriateness for the
proposed application shall be provided at the request of the Director of Public
Works or the City Engineer for evaluation. Proposed pipe materials may be
rejected for a specific application by the Director of Public Works or the City
Engineer.
   (C)   Pipe bedding and backfill. Details for pipe bedding and backfill shall
be approved by the City Engineer.
   (D)   Ditches. Drainage ditches, where approved by the City Council, may be
used for outfalls to natural or manmade major drainage channels. Ditches shall
have a minimum grade that will arrive at a velocity of not less than one and
one-half feet per second, and not larger than four feet per second. Velocities
may exceed four feet per second with the utilization of appropriate erosion
control measures. Side slopes shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical. Maximum depth shall be four feet without the use of a guardrail.
   (E)   Major drainage ways and structures. The design of major drainage ways
through a subdivision and major structures, such as box culverts or bridges
across major drainage channels, shall be coordinated with the City Engineer and
the city's comprehensive plan (latest edition), and if deemed appropriate, the
county engineer.

§ 155.193 OPEN CHANNEL, DETENTION/RETENTION POND DESIGN.
   The latest revision (as of the adoption of this ordinance) of the Montgomery
County Drainage Criteria Manual shall be used as a base standard for open
channels and detention/retention facilities within a subdivision, unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
   (A)   Open channels. Open channels may be used for outfalls and major
drainage ways. The following criteria shall be used in determining the nature
of the open channel:
      (1)   Channels may be left in their natural state, provided that the
channel has capacity for the developed flows with one foot of freeboard and
velocities are 6.0 feet per second or less.
      (2)   If the natural channel is to be replaced by an improved channel,
the flow from the 100-year design flood must be contained within the improved
channel while allowing for one foot of freeboard.
      (3)   Improved channels shall include a lined section if the design
velocity is greater than four feet per second. Lining types, such as concrete,
rock walls, erosion control mats and gabions, may be used upon the approval of
the City Engineer. Improved channels with design velocities less than the
permissible velocities given by the City Engineer may be earthen if the
channels are revegetated properly.
      (4)   Lined channels shall have the entire channel bottom and at least
the first three feet (vertical height) of the side slopes up from the channel
bottom lined, unless approved by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Earthen sides above the lined section or totally earthen channels
shall be on at least a three feet horizontal to one foot vertical slope, and
shall have approved ground cover to prevent erosion.
      (6)   Improved channels shall have the following minimum side slopes,
unless shown to be feasible in a soils report sealed by a registered
professional engineer in the state, and approved by the City Engineer:
         (a)   Three feet horizontal to one foot vertical slope for earthen
grassed side slopes.
         (b)   One and one-half feet horizontal to one foot vertical slope for
side slopes in rock.
      (7)   The developer or owner shall use low maintenance vegetation for
vegetative cover, as approved by the City Engineer prior to planting. The
selection of planting materials shall comply with locally accepted industry
standards.
      (8)   The developer or owner shall provide a drainage easement and
required maintenance easement which shall be dedicated to the city as a
permanent drainage right-of-way and open space corridor.
   (B)   Detention/retention facilities. Runoff rates shall be limited to rates
from undeveloped areas. Such requirement shall also apply to the development of
sites such as churches, schools and other institutional uses. Detention/
retention facilities to reduce runoff rates shall be provided to offset the
impacts of developments to runoff rates equal to undeveloped areas.
Developments that include 15,000 square feet of impervious area or less shall
be exempt from the detention/retention requirements. Detention/retention
facilities shall be designed for the 100-year design flood in accordance with
the following:
      (1)   The minimum amount of storage volume of the detention basin shall
be the volume required to reduce runoff rates to an undeveloped rate. Dedicated
detention/retention basins shall also include an additional one foot of
freeboard.
      (2)   Detention areas in parking lots shall not be:
         (a)   In required parking spaces, but shall be in extra spaces.
         (b)   Behind speed bumps, unless the speed bumps are made with
reinforced concrete.
         (c)   Deeper than six inches, unless warning signs are posted.
      (3)   Drainage easements shall be provided for all regional detention/
retention facilities and for other detention/retention facilities where two or
more owners are involved.
      (4)   Detention/retention facilities shall be designed to empty all
detention storage in less than 24 hours.
      (5)   Detention/retention facilities shall not be counted as an erosion
control technique, unless:
         (a)   The basin is designed to empty a minimum of 24 hours after the
storm event; and
         (b)   Adequate sediment storage areas in the basin have been set aside
and are maintained.
      (6)   Detention/retention facilities shall be maintained by the owner,
unless such facilities are dedicated to and accepted in writing by the city.
      (7)   The engineer shall certify that the detention/retention facilities
were constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications. The engineer
shall provide a signed as-built drawing showing dimensions and elevations of
the detention/retention facility.
      (8)   Any existing subdivision/development that increases the impervious
(or semi-impervious) area by more than 15,000 square feet must provide
detention/retention/mitigation for the increase in impervious or semi-
impervious development.

§ 155.194 RESPONSIBILITY OF OWNER AND DEVELOPER.
   (A)   The owner or developer of property to be developed or changed shall be
responsible for all storm drainage flowing from a fully developed watershed.
Such responsibility shall include drainage directed to the property by ultimate
development, as well as drainage naturally flowing through the property due to
topography. When property is proposed for development, use or modification,
provisions shall be made for storm drainage in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Where the improvement or construction of a storm drainage facility is
required along a property line common to two or more owners, the owner
proposing development of his or her property shall be responsible for the
required improvements at the time of development, including the dedication of
all necessary rights-of-way or easements, to accommodate the improvements.
   (C)   When a property owner proposes development or use of only a portion of
his or her property, provision for storm drainage in accordance with this
chapter shall be required in the portion of the property proposed for immediate
development. Improvements of a drainage facility outside such designated
portion of the property shall be required for the handling of the development
of the designated portion.
   (D)   When a property owner proposes a development, provisions shall be made
in the comprehensive drainage plan for control of excess siltation and
downstream erosion.
   (E)   The owner shall dedicate the required drainage easements.
Determination of the minimum easement required shall be made by the City
Engineer.
   (F)   If a property owner or developer desires to modify an existing pond or
lake, or impound storm water by constructing a dam within a property for
retention or detention, thereby creating a lake, pond, lagoon or basin as a
part of the planned development of the property, the standard provisions for
storm drainage as established in this chapter shall be applicable, and shall
provide that:
      (1)   An engineering plan for such construction, including the
comprehensive drainage plan and a storage facility study prepared by a
registered professional engineer, shall have been approved by the city;
      (2)   The owner and developer shall retain the constructed lake, pond,
lagoon or basin under private ownership, and assume full liability for the
protection of the general public from any health or safety hazards related to
such construction;
      (3)   The owner and developer shall assume full responsibility for the
maintenance of the constructed lake, pond, lagoon or basin;
      (4)   The obligations set forth in this division shall run with the land,
and shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such land; and
      (5)   All Federal, state and county laws pertaining to impoundment of
surface water are complied with, including the design, construction and safety
of the impounding structure. Any existing structure which is included in a
project development area shall be improved to comply with the applicable
Federal, state, county and city safety requirements for structures. The design
flows shall be based on a fully developed watershed in accordance with the
comprehensive land use plan for a 100-year flood. All improvements shall be
made to the dam structure at the expense of the developer prior to acceptance
of the adjacent street, utilities and drainage improvements.
   (G)   On any existing structure, the owner shall furnish to the city a study
by a professional engineer, registered in the state, for approval prior to any
proposed alteration. Compensatory storage shall be provided so that a 100-year
flood retention capacity is provided.
   (H)   The property owner shall keep the city advised in writing of the
current name and address of the responsible agent.
   (I)   All existing water seepage springs or flowing water shall be connected
into an underground storm sewer system or shall be discharged into an
appropriate facility intended to carry storm water runoff. Such flow shall not
be permitted to discharge directly into the street gutter line.
   (J)   Fences (private and public screening) shall be constructed so that an
obstruction to surface water flow shall not occur. Such requirement shall
include the requirement that erosive conditions shall not be created around,
under or near a fence structure.
   (K)   Since urbanization is anticipated on all drainage areas, all
improvements shall be designed for the case of full watershed development. The
developer shall be responsible for the necessary facilities to provide drainage
patterns and controls so that properties within the drainage area, whether
upstream or downstream of the development, are not adversely affected by storm
drainage from facilities on the development. A letter from an engineer licensed
in the state shall be provided certifying that properties within the drainage
area will not be adversely affected. The letter shall be sealed, signed and
dated.
   (L)   A storage facility study and comprehensive drainage plan shall be
provided to the City Engineer with the final engineering drawings. The storage
facility study and comprehensive drainage plan shall be prepared in a
quantitative manner. The comprehensive drainage plan shall include:
      (1)   Methods to be used for the disposal of storm water runoff from the
proposed development;
      (2)   Provisions for contributing drainage from adjacent properties;
      (3)   A topographic drainage area map, indicating all areas contributing
drainage runoff;
      (4)   On-site and off-site drainage easements;
      (5)   Proposed and existing storm sewers, curb inlets and open channels;
      (6)   A table showing the drainage subareas, land use, C-factor, rainfall
intensity, time of concentration, frequency factor, area in acres and amount of
runoff;
      (7)   An indication of runoff at all inlets, dead-end streets and alleys
and to adjacent off-site property;
      (8)   An indication of floodplain and flood way boundaries;
      (9)   An indication of siltation and erosion control measures for the
entire development and/or stage development;
      (10)   An indication of flow arrows on drawings;
      (11)   A detailed off-site drainage plan.
   (M)   All storm drainage improvements or modifications shall be planned in
the best interest of the immediate and adjacent properties, and shall be
designed using the design criteria adopted by the City and the most current
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood data. The floodplain and
floodway boundaries indicated on the drawings shall be determined based on a
fully developed watershed, in accordance with the comprehensive land use plan
of the City. The FEMA flood boundaries shall represent the minimum flood
boundaries to be used.
   (N)   All development shall be designed and constructed in a way to have no
negative affect on surrounding areas or unreasonably:
      (1)   Impede the natural flow of surface waters from higher adjacent
properties;
      (2)   Alter the natural flow of surface waters so as to discharge them
upon adjacent properties at a more rapid rate or in a different location than
would result from the pre development natural flow of surface waters; or
      (3)   Collect or concentrate the flow of surface waters for discharge
into an existing natural or artificial drainage way in a manner which exceeds
the capacity of the receiving water course.
   (O)   Storm drainage released from the site will be discharged to a
watercourse of an adequate size to control the peak runoff expected after
development. The City Engineer shall be provided the necessary data showing the
adequacy of the watercourse. Criteria for on-site development shall apply to
off-site improvements. Any discharge point exiting the property shall be within
the required drainage easements or right of way on adjacent property.
Determination of the minimum easement required shall be made by the City
Engineer.
   (P)   The design, size, type and location of all storm drainage facilities
shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer. The requirements set
forth in this section shall be considered minimum requirements. The developer
and his or her engineer shall bear the total responsibility for the adequacy of
the design. The approval of the facilities by the City shall in no way relieve
the developer of such responsibility.
   (Q)   Requests for a variance, detailing specific reasons for the variance,
shall be submitted in writing. The City Engineer shall make a recommendation to
the City Council for its approval of the variance. Variations and modifications
to the storm drainage requirement of the city may be made when special or
peculiar factors and conditions warrant such variations and modifications, and
when such variations and modifications do not affect the general intent,
application or spirit of the storm drainage rules and regulations of the city.

INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
§ 155.210 OVERSIZING.
   (A)   Where necessary to provide for development of adjacent properties or
to conform to the provisions of the comprehensive plan, the city may require
the dedication or installation of oversized infrastructure. The developer shall
be responsible for the entire costs of designing and installing all
infrastructure, which is intended for the primary purpose of serving a new
development.
   (B)   The City Council upon the recommendation of the City Engineer and the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine the need for oversized
infrastructure at the earliest practical stage prior to the time of plat
approval. The City Engineer may recommend that oversized infrastructure be
required.
   (C)   If the developer contends that infrastructure requirements imposed as
a condition of plat approval actually constitute oversizing, then, the
developer must request the Planning and Zoning Commission to determine whether
or not such requirements actually constitute oversizing. In reaching such a
determination, the Commission shall consider the actual requirements which are
reasonably necessary to provide service to the development in accordance with
good engineering practices, including the development's location and size,
proximity to sources of water supply and waste water treatment, the effect on
line pressures and gravity flow, the size of existing infrastructure to which
connection is to be made and any other relevant matters. If the Commission
shall determine that requirements actually constitute oversizing, then the
Commission shall also determine whether or not a need exists for such oversized
infrastructure.
   (D)   If it is determined that a need exists for the installation of
oversized infrastructure, then the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
recommend that the City Council enter into an agreement with developer
providing for the funding and construction of oversized infrastructure. If the
City council shall fail to take action upon such recommendation within 30 days
of preliminary plat approval, then the recommendation shall be rejected and the
developer may proceed to obtain final plat approval without oversizing.
   (E)   Oversized infrastructure does not include land or infrastructure
provided outside of a new development, which are necessary for the provision of
services to the development. While not eligible for oversize participation, the
developer may be eligible for reimbursement under the city's policy set out
below on the extension of infrastructure winch benefits other abutting
properties.
(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009)
§ 155.211 REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR OVERSIZED INFRASTRUCTURE.
   (A)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council
may approve an agreement for developer reimbursement for the installation of
oversized infrastructure. Such agreements must be approved and executed prior
to final plat approval.
   (B)   Reimbursable costs are limited to the difference between the materials
and installation costs of the oversized infrastructure and the estimated costs
of infrastructure of a size necessary to serve the proposed development only.
Provided that necessary public easements have first been dedicated and
accepted, the City may elect to perform the work using its own forces.
   (C)   Where the work is to be performed by the developer, the agreement must
provide for the establishment of an escrow account into which both the city and
developer shall deposit their respective estimated costs. Payments shall be
disbursed from the escrow account only upon the mutual approval of both city
and developer. Contracts paid from the escrow account must provide for a
minimum 10% retainage or require that payment be withheld until completion and
acceptance of the required work. Where the city contribution is estimated to
exceed the amount for which competitive bidding would be required, the

(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009)
§ 155.212 REIMBURSEMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLED OUTSIDE A DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Where streets, water lines, sewer lines or other infrastructure
installed within public easements are provided outside of the development and
thereby benefit other abutting undeveloped properties, the City may impose and
collect an acreage fee on behalf of the original developer installing such
infrastructure. A formula that shall determine how much of the original
extension and oversized utilities cost will be reimbursed to the original
developer will be agreed on prior to granting access to a subsequent
development to the newly extended infrastructure.
   (B)   Acreage fees must be calculated on a front foot basis and total
acreage to be served, which distributes the cost equally among all abutting
property owners who subsequently benefit from the original infrastructure
extension(s). Acreage fees may not include reimbursement for costs incurred
within the interior of the original developer's development. The original
developer's application for acreage fee reimbursement must include a proposed
fee as well as an accounting of the costs included within the fee. The Planning
and Zoning Commission and the City Council must approve the fee prior to
collection.
   (C)   Acreage fees applicable to subsequent development(s) will be collected
upon final plat approval or the issuance of a building permit for the abutting
property, whichever occurs first, and promptly remitted to the original
developer. Acreage fees may be collected for a period often years following the
City Council's approval of the final plat. The developer shall not be
reimbursed for any portion of the costs not collected within such period of
time. The city shall require payment of acreage fees from subsequent developer
(s) as a condition of building permit or plat.
(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009)
§ 155.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter or
who shall fail to comply therewith or with any of the requirements thereof, or
who shall erect or alter any building, or who shall commence to erect or alter
any building in violation of any detailed statement of plan submitted or
approved thereunder, shall for each violation or noncompliance be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, shall be fined as follows:
      (1)    Not more than $500 for each violation, and in addition shall pay
all costs and expenses involved in the case.
      (2)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such
other lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The owner of that building or premises or part thereof where anything
in violation of this chapter shall be placed or shall exist, and any architect,
builder, contractor, agent or corporation employed in connection therewith who
may have assisted in the commission of any such violation shall be subject to
the penalties herein provided.
