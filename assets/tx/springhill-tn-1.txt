   (a)   (1)   The residents of any incorporated municipality or of any
territory wanting to incorporate under this charter may adopt the provisions of
this chapter and chapters 2-4 of this title in the manner provided in this
chapter. Thereupon the municipality or territory shall be and become
incorporated and be governed as herein set forth. No unincorporated territory
shall be incorporated under the provisions of this charter unless such
territory contains not fewer than one thousand five hundred (1,500) persons,
who shall be actual residents of the territory.
      (2)   No unincorporated territory shall be allowed to hold a referendum
on the question of whether or not to incorporate under this charter until a
plan of services is documented setting forth the identification and projected
timing of municipal services proposed to be provided and the revenue from
purely local sources to be payable annually. The plan of services shall be
attached to the petition to incorporate when such petition is filed with the
county election commission. The plan of services shall include, but not be
limited to: police protection, fire protection, water service, sanitary sewage
system, solid waste disposal, road and street construction and repair,
recreational facilities, a proposed five-year operational budget, including
projected revenues and expenditures, and the revenue from purely local sources
to be payable annually. Municipalities that are first incorporated on or after
July 1, 1993, that produce no local own source revenues in any fiscal year
shall not receive any state-shared revenues during the next fiscal year.
      (3)   Prior to filing the petition with the county election commission, a
public hearing on the referendum on the question of whether or not to
incorporate under this charter and plan of services shall be conducted. The
public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation for
two (2) consecutive weeks.
   (b)   (1)   If any part of the unincorporated territory proposed for
incorporation is within five (5) miles of an existing municipality of one
hundred thousand (100,000) or more according to the most recent federal census
and if the governing body of such municipality adopts a resolution by a two-
thirds (2/3) vote indicating that the municipality has no desire to annex the
territory, such territory may be included in a proposed new municipality. A
petition for incorporation shall include a certified copy of such resolution
from the affected municipality.
      (2)   In any county having a population of more than eighteen thousand
two hundred (18,200) and less than eighteen thousand five hundred (18,500)
according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, if any
part of the unincorporated territory proposed for incorporation is within five
(5) miles of an existing municipality of one hundred thousand (100,000) or more
in population or within two (2) miles of an existing municipality of more than
one thousand (1,000) and fewer than one hundred thousand (100,000) in
population, according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent census, then
action on the petition as provided in §§
6-1-202 and
6-1-204 shall be held in abeyance for fifteen (15) months from the date of
filing the petition. If, within this period, the existing municipality does not
annex at least twenty percent (20%) of the land area or twenty percent (20%) of
the population of the territory proposed for incorporation, then proceedings
shall be continued as provided in §§
6-1-202 and
6-1-204 as though the petition had been filed at the conclusion of the fifteen
(15) month period. If the existing municipality annexes at least that part of
the territory within this period, then the petition shall be null and void.
   (c)—(e)   [Deleted by 1993 amendment].
   (f)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) to the
contrary, a territory may be incorporated if the following conditions are
fulfilled:
      (1)   The territory contains two hundred twenty-five (225) residents or
more;
      (2)   The territory is composed of property which is sixteen hundred
(1600) feet or more above sea level on the western border of the territory and
contiguous with a county boundary on the eastern border of the territory;
      (3)   The territory is located within an area which is bordered on the
west, north and east by the Tennessee River and on the south by the border
between Tennessee and another State; and
      (4)   The territory is located within a metropolitan statistical area.
   (g)   (1)   Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section to the
contrary, a territory may be incorporated that meets the following conditions:

         (B)   The territory’s western boundary is contiguous with the western

      (2)   The territory described in this subsection may incorporate
notwithstanding the provisions and restrictions in subsections (a) and (b).
   (h)   Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, or §§
6-1-202,
6-1-203, and
6-1-209, or any other provision of law to the contrary, a petition for
incorporation may consist of a letter from a resident of the territory desiring
to incorporate to the county election commission requesting that the question
of incorporating the territory be placed on the ballot. The letter shall
describe the exact boundaries of the proposed municipality, indicate the name
of the proposed municipality, and indicate under which charter the territory
desires to incorporate. The letter shall be treated as a petition meeting all
the requirements of law.
   (i)   (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, whenever
the governing body of any existing city affected by this section, by a
resolution adopted by a majority vote of its governing body, indicates that it
has no interest in annexing the property to be incorporated, and when a
certified copy of such resolution and a petition requesting that an
incorporation election be held are filed with the county election commission,
then the proceedings shall continue as provided in this chapter as though the
proposed new incorporation were not within the specified distance of such
existing city as provided in this section.
      (2)   The provisions of this subsection shall only apply in counties
having a population of not less than 80,000 nor more than 83,000 according to
the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census; provided, that in an
adjoining county an existing municipality that is within the specified distance

municipality or territory. The petition shall include a current list of the
registered voters who live within the proposed territory. The petition shall

commission shall examine the petition to determine the validity of the
signatures in accordance with Section 2-1-107. The county election commission
shall have a period of twenty (20) days to certify whether the petition has the

election commission shall hold an election, providing options to vote “FOR” or

days nor more than sixty (60) days after the petition is certified. The date of
the election shall be set in accordance with Section 2-3-204. The county
election commission shall, in addition to all other notices required by law,
publish one (1) notice of the election in a newspaper of general circulation
within the territory of the municipality or of the proposed municipality, and
post the notice in at least three (3) places in the territory.
   (b)   At any time not less than thirty (30) days prior to the election
provided for in this part, the petition may be withdrawn or may be amended to
call for a smaller territory for the proposed municipal corporation so long as
all of the proposed smaller territory is contained within the boundaries of the
territory described in the first petition. The withdrawal or amendment shall be
valid if filed with the county election commission in writing, and if signed by
not fewer than fifty-one percent (51%) of those who signed the original
petition. In the event such an amended petition is filed, all provisions
relating to time periods in §
6-1-201, shall be controlled by the date of the filing of the original
petition, notwithstanding the filing of the amended petition, and the county
election commission shall publish the notice of election as provided for
herein. A petition to withdraw, when filed with and validated by the county
election commission, shall render the original petition null and void.
   (c)   A cash bond equivalent to the costs of the election to incorporate
under this charter shall be filed by the petitioners with the county election
commission along with the petition for incorporation.
[Acts 1991, ch. 154, § 1; Acts 1998, ch. 1101, § 28]

initial two-year term, the proposed name of the municipality and whether it is
a city or town. The petition shall include a plan of services setting forth the
identification and projected timing of municipal services proposed to be
provided and the revenue from purely local sources to be payable annually. The
plan of services shall include, but not be limited to: police protection, fire
protection, water service, sanitary sewage system, solid waste disposal, road
and street construction and repair, recreational facilities, a proposed five-
year operational budget, including projected revenues and expenditures, and a

[Acts 1991, ch. 154, § 1; Acts 1993, ch. 320, § 3; Acts 1995, ch. 13, § 2]
§ 6-1-204 REGISTRATION OF VOTERS—QUALIFICATIONS TO VOTE— CERTIFICATION OF

   (a)   All registered voters of the municipality or of the territory of the
proposed municipality are eligible to vote in the election.
   (b)   The county election commission shall determine and declare the result
of the election and shall certify the result in accordance with § 2-8-105(3)

the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, registered voters who
own real property located in any such municipality shall be entitled to vote in
all municipal elections and municipal referenda held in such municipality. The
provisions of § 2-2-107(a)(3) shall apply to such property rights voting within
such municipality. The approval or nonapproval of such resolution shall be

§ 6-1-205 EFFECT OF VOTE.
   (a)   If the majority of the votes cast are in favor of the adoption of this

207. Except for the provisions of this charter that are adopted by reference in
other municipal charters, the provisions of this charter apply only to those
municipalities that have adopted this charter by referendum as authorized by
law.
   (b)   Following the defeat of an incorporation in an election held pursuant
to §
6-1-202, no new petition for an election may be filed until after the

(60) days after its adoption by the board unless ten percent (10%) of the
qualified electors of the municipality sign a petition and present it to the
board during such sixty (60) day period requesting that the resolution be
referred to the electors, in which case it must receive the approval of a
majority of the electors voting thereon at an election held as provided in
subdivision (3). If such a petition is not received within such sixty-day
period, the resolution shall become operative at the end of such sixty-day
period and the Mayor shall file a copy of the resolution indicating the new
corporate name of the municipality with the Secretary of State.

operative on the date that the county election commission makes its official
canvas of the election returns. The county election commission shall then
promptly certify the results of the election to the Secretary of State and the
new corporate name of the municipality.
   (5)   If the majority vote is against the election, the question of
approving the resolution shall not be included on any subsequent election
ballot unless a new resolution is first approved by the board in the manner
provided in this section.

elected from each ward. The mayor and aldermen elected to the first board shall
serve the four (4) and two (2) year terms prescribed by §
6-1-207(b). At each election thereafter the mayor and aldermen shall be elected
to four (4) year terms, except in transitional elections prescribed by
subsection (c). Any municipality that incorporated under this charter after
June 30, 1991, and that has a population of less than five thousand (5,000) and
has only one (1) ward, may by ordinance increase the number of aldermen to a
maximum of four (4) without increasing the number of wards. The ordinance shall
provide for staggered four (4) year terms in accordance with §
6-1-207(b), but may provide for transitional terms of less than four (4) years.

wards shall consist of a mayor elected at large and two (2) aldermen elected
from each ward, except that municipalities having more than one (1) ward may
reduce the number of aldermen from each ward from two (2) to one (1). The board
of any municipality having between five (5) and eight (8) wards shall consist
of a mayor elected at large and one (1) alderman elected from each ward. In
wards having more than one (1) alderman, the aldermen shall serve staggered
terms of office within their wards.
      (2)   Any municipality that has only one (1) ward may provide by
ordinance for numerical designations for aldermanic positions. After numerical
positions have been designated, candidates for alderman shall qualify by
indicating on the qualifying petition the position the candidate is seeking.
Ballots shall indicate the position to be filled by the selection of candidates
listed under “Alderman, position 1,” “Alderman, position 2,” and so on. Any
qualified person residing in the municipality may seek an open aldermanic
position, but may qualify in any election for only one (1) position.
   (c)   All increases and reductions in the number of wards and aldermen under
this section shall be accomplished only by ordinance passed by a two-third (2/
3) vote of the entire membership to which the board is entitled. The ordinance
shall:
      (1)   Take effect at the next municipal election, but shall not affect
the present terms of members of the board of mayor and aldermen;
      (2)   Where appropriate, establish and describe the new ward boundaries;
      (3)   Provide for a transitional election following the adoption of the
ordinance in which the mayor and/or aldermen running for office shall be
elected for terms that will expire at the next municipal election;
      (4)   At the second municipal election following the adoption of the
ordinance provide for a system of staggered terms of office under which the
mayor is elected for a term of four (4) years, in cities with an even number of
wards half the total number of mayor and aldermen running for office are
elected to four (4) year terms, in cities with an uneven number of wards one
(1) more or one (1) less than half the total number of mayor and aldermen
running for office, are elected to four (4) year terms, in both classes of
cities the remaining aldermen are elected to two (2) year terms, and following
which all aldermen shall be elected for four (4) year terms;
      (5)   In the case of a ward that has been abolished provide that any
alderman whose term extends past the life of a ward shall serve as an alderman
at large for the remainder of the term.

redevelopment occurs on adjacent property.
(2011 Code, § 2-406) (Ord. 07-01, passed 4- -2007)
§ 2-407 CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION OF HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT SITES.
   The following criteria are to be used in determining eligibility and
appropriateness of selection as a historically significant site:
   (A)   The quality of significance in the city’s history, architecture,
archaeology and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures
and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling and association, and that:
      (1)   Are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of the city’s history;
      (2)   Are associated with the lives of persons significant in the city’s
past;
      (3)   Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method
of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components lack individual distinction; or
      (4)   Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory or history.
   (B)   Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces or graves of historical figures,
properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes,
structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed
historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature and properties
that have achieved significance within the past 75 years shall not be
considered eligible for the city’s historic register. However, such properties
will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria
or if they fall within the following categories:
      (1)   A religious property deriving primary significance from
architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance;
      (2)   A building or structure removed from its original location but
which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the
surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or
event;
      (3)   A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding
importance if there is no appropriate site or building directly associated with
his or her productive life;
      (4)   A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of
persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features
or from association with historic events;
      (5)   A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable
environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master
plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has
survived; and
      (6)   A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is
of exceptional importance.
(2011 Code, § 2-407) (Ord. 07-01, passed 4- -2007)
§ 2-408 MAPPING OF HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT SITES.
   (A)   All official city maps shall be modified to allow for the inclusion of
designated historically significant sites in an appropriate and consistent
manner.
   (B)   An application for a subdivision of property, site development plan
and/or zoning district amendment shall identify all significant historic and
archeological features and structures (as designated by the Board of Mayor and
Aldermen) that are located on the affected property or within 300 feet of the
boundary of the affected property. Any proposed development plan for the
affected tract shall be guided by city zoning and subdivision regulations and
the principles and standards contained within the publication, Saving the
Farmstead (a publication of the Heritage Foundation of Franklin and Williamson
County, dated December 1996). The development plan shall be configured in a
manner that protects the historic and archeological features on the property to
the greatest extent feasible and practical. The plan shall be subject to review
and comments by a qualified historic preservation consultant retained by the
city and the recommendations of the city’s Historic Commission. Upon approval
of a development plan by the Planning Commission, no grading or building
permits shall be issued by the City Manager or his or her designee until
stabilization measures are in place to permanently protect the feature from the
impact of nearby construction.
(2011 Code, § 2-408) (Ord. 07-01, passed 4- -2007)
§ 2-409 REMOVAL OF CLASSIFICATION.
   Any property owner of a historically significant site may petition the
Historic Commission to have the designation removed. The Historic Commission
upon such petition or request from the owner of the property shall, by vote of
the Commission, recommend or not recommend to the Board of Mayor and Aldermen
the removal of such designation. The Board of Mayor and Aldermen shall vote on
the petition or request, in the form of a resolution, to remove or allow the
property to remain on the city’s list of historically significant properties.
The Board of Mayor and Aldermen shall not be bound by any decision of the
Historic Commission as such is only advisory in nature.

§ 5-502 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The Board of Mayor and Aldermen (“Board”) hereby finds and declares
that:
      (1)   The city is committed to the provision of public facilities and
services at levels attainable within its resources to cure any existing public
service deficiencies in already developed areas;
      (2)   Such facilities and services levels will be provided by the city
utilizing available funds allocated via the capital budget and capital
improvements programming processes and relying upon the funding sources
indicated therein;
      (3)   However, new residential and non-residential development imposes
increased and excessive demands on city public facilities and services
including, without limitation, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water lines,
water tanks, a fire hall, fire trucks and police cars, safety and rescue
equipment, public works machinery, roads and parks that would not otherwise be
necessary;
      (4)   Planning and zoning projections indicate that such development will
continue and will place ever increasing demands on the city to provide
necessary public facilities;
      (5)   To the extent that such developments place demands on the public
facility infrastructure, those demands should be satisfied by shifting the
responsibility for financing the provision of such facilities from the public
at large to the developments actually creating the demands; and
      (6)   The amount of the impact fee to be imposed shall be determined by
the cost of the additional public facilities needed to support such
development.
   (B)   The Board of Mayor and Aldermen, after careful consideration of the
matter, hereby finds and declares that an impact fee imposed upon residential
and non-residential development in order to finance specified major public
facilities, the demand for which is created by such development is in the best
interest of the general welfare of the city and its residents, is equitable,
does not impose an unfair burden on such development by forcing developers and
builders to pay more than their fair or proportionate share of the cost, and
deems it advisable to adopt this chapter, as hereinafter set forth.
(2011 Code, § 5-502) (Ord. 15-04, passed 12-21-2015; Ord. 19-11A, passed 4-15-
2019)
§ 5-503 INTENT.
   This chapter is intended to impose an impact fee at the time of building
permit or certificate of occupancy issuance, in an amount based upon the gross
square footage of non-residential development and number of residential
dwelling units in order to finance public facilities, the demand for which is
generated by new development. The city will meet, to the extent finances permit
through the use of general city revenues, all capital improvement needs
associated with existing development. Only needs created by new development
will be met by impact fees. Impact fees shall not exceed the cost of providing
capital improvements for which the need is substantially attributable to those
developments that pay the fees. The fees shall be spent on new or enlarged
capital facilities improvements that substantially benefit those developments
that pay the fees.

   (A)   No building permit shall be issued for a development in unless the
impact fee is imposed and calculated pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Impact fees shall not exceed the cost of providing capital
improvements for which the need is reasonably attributable to those
developments that pay the fees. The fees shall be spent on new or enlarged
capital improvements that reasonably benefit those developments that pay the
fees.

equitable assessment described in subsection (B) above may be spent on new or
enlarged capital improvements that will reasonably benefit anticipated future
development rather than those developments that have paid the fee.

assessed in such a manner that any new development having the same impacts on
capital facilities shall be assessed the same impact fee. This provision
notwithstanding, the Board may contribute from the General Fund any part or all
of the impact fee assessed against certain new development that achieves other
policies, including, but not limited to, the provision of affordable housing
and the retention of existing employment or the generation of new employment.

   (C)   Maintenance of records. The city’s Finance Department shall maintain
and keep accurate financial records for each such account that shall show the
source and disbursement of all revenues; that shall account for all monies
received; that shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account
shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of projects specified in
the capital improvements program; and that shall provide an annual accounting
for each impact fee account showing the source and amount of all funds
collected and the projects that were funded.
   (D)   Review and modification. The city shall review, in conjunction with
the capital budget and capital improvements plan adoption processes, the
development potential of the city and the capital improvements plan and make
such modifications to impact fee schedules as are deemed necessary every three
years as a result of:
      (1)   Development occurring in the prior years;
      (2)   Capital development potential of the city and the capital
improvements actually constructed;
      (3)   Changing facility needs;
      (4)   Inflation;
      (5)   Revised cost estimates for capital improvements;
      (6)   Changes in the availability of other funding sources applicable to
public facility projects; and

pledged toward retirement of bonds, revenue certificates or other obligations
of indebtedness for such projects may include the fees and taxes herein imposed
and impact fees and other city revenues as may be allocated by the Board of
Mayor and Aldermen. Impact fees paid pursuant to this chapter, however, shall
be restricted to use solely and exclusively for financing directly, or as a
pledge against bonds, revenue certificates and other obligations of
indebtedness for the cost of capital improvements, as specified herein.

fee has been paid may apply for a refund of such fee if:
      (1)   The city has failed to expend the funds within six years of the
date of payment of the impact fee, to be determined according to first-in/
first-out accounting; or
      (2)   The project for which a building permit has been issued has been
altered resulting in a decrease in the amount of the impact fee due.
   (B)   A petition for refund must be filed within one year of the event
giving rise to the right to claim a refund.
   (C)   The petition for refund must be submitted to the City Engineer, or his
or her designee, on a form provided by the city for such purpose.
   (D)   Within one month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the
City Engineer, or his or her duly designated agent, must provide the
petitioners in writing, with a decision on the refund request including the
reasons for the decision. If a refund is due petitioner, the City Engineer, or
his or her duly designated agent, shall notify the Finance Department and

or refund due to the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. The applicant must file a
notice of appeal with the Board of Mayor and Aldermen within 30 days following
the determination of the applicability of the impact fee ordinance, the impact
fee or refund due. If the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other
sufficient surety satisfactory to the municipal counsel in an amount equal to
the impact fee due, as calculated by the City Engineer, or his or her designee,
the chief Building Official shall issue the building permit. The filing of an
appeal shall not stay the collection of the impact fee due unless a bond or
other sufficient surety has been filed.

§ 5-513 EFFECT OF IMPACT FEE ON ZONING AND SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   This chapter shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of
property, density of development, design and improvement standards and
requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of
capital improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other
regulations of the city, which shall be operative and remain in full force and
effect without limitation with respect to all such development.

§ 5-514 IMPACT FEE AS ADDITIONAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL REQUIREMENT.
   The impact fee is additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution
of, any other requirements imposed by the city on the development of land or
the issuance of building permits. It is intended to be consistent with and to
further the objectives and policies of the capital improvements plan, and other
city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to ensure the
provision of public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. In
no event shall a property owner be obligated to pay for capital improvements in
an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this and any other
impact fee or similar ordinance; but, provided that, a property owner may be
required to pay, pursuant to city ordinances, regulations or policies, for
other capital improvements in addition to the impact fee for capital
improvements as specified herein.

§ 5-516 CREDITS.
   (A)   A property owner may elect, with written permission of the Board of
Mayor and Aldermen, to construct an eligible capital improvement listed in the
capital improvements plan. If the property owner elects to make such
improvement, the property owner must enter into an agreement with the city
prior to issuance of any building permit. The agreement must establish the
estimated cost of the improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion
of the improvement, a requirement that the improvement be completed to city
standards, and such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the city.
The city must review the improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules,
determine if the improvement is an eligible improvement, and determine the
amount of the applicable credit for such improvement to be applied to the
otherwise applicable impact fee prior to issuance of any building permit. In no
event may the city provide a refund for a credit that is greater than the
applicable impact fee. If, however, the amount of the credit is calculated to
be greater than the amount of the impact fee due, the property owner may
utilize such excess credit toward the impact fees imposed on other building
permits for development on the same site and in the same ownership.
   (B)   No credits shall be given for the construction of local on-site
facilities required by zoning, subdivision or other city regulations.

review the roadway impact fee schedule at least every three years or on a
sooner basis as deemed necessary by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.

§ 5-601 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and cited as the “Spring Hill Adequate
Facilities Tax”.
(2011 Code, § 5-601)
§ 5-602 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is intended to assure the provision of adequate park, road,
police, fire, safety, sanitation, sewer and water facilities to serve new
development in the city by requiring each new development to pay a tax
proportionate to the need for new facilities created by such development, the
proceeds of which shall be used exclusively to fund capital improvements made
necessary by new growth.
(2011 Code, § 5-602)
§ 5-603 FINDINGS.
   The Board of Mayor and Aldermen (hereinafter “Board”) hereby finds and
declares that:
   (A)   The city is experiencing rapid pollution and employment growth, as a
result of the location of the General Motors Corporation’s Saturn Plant;
   (B)   The city will experience an increase of 600 or more residential
dwelling units by the year 1999;
   (C)   The anticipated population growth in the city creates the demand for
additional road, park, police, fire, safety, sanitation and water facilities;
   (D)   The city, insofar as its revenues allow, is committed to the provision
of such public facilities and services at levels of service necessary to
support anticipated residential growth;
   (E)   The city has prepared a ten-year capital improvements plan which, to
the extent possible, identifies such facilities and services levels and
designates the sources of funding the same;
   (F)   The estimated capital improvements costs of these facilities to serve
new growth for the next ten years will be approximately $10,000,000;
   (G)   The city’s capital improvements plan apportions the costs of providing
additional public facilities and services among existing and future users of
such facilities in proportion to the demands for these facilities generated by
such users, the Board realizing that the city’s facilities before Saturn were
adequate for its population at that time and its pre-Saturn rate of growth for
the next 20 years;
   (H)   The demand for additional public facilities to serve new growth in the
city is generated by residential development and, to some extent, by non-
residential development, such as the Ryder Transportation facilities, and
anticipated future non-residential development; taking into consideration
factors such as usage of public facilities by employees residing outside of the
city and demand for specialized services necessitated by non-residential

§ 8-223 SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION OF BEER PERMITS.
   (A)   (1)   All permits issued by the Beer Board under the provisions of
this chapter shall be subject to suspension or revocation by the Beer Board
when the holder thereof is guilty of making false statement or
misrepresentation in his application or for the violation of any provision of
the state beer laws, or any provision of this chapter. However, no beer permit
shall be revoked or suspended until a public hearing is held by the Beer Board
after reasonable notice to all the known parties in interest. Suspension or
revocation proceedings may be initiated by any interested person, by the Chief
of Police or any member of the police force of the city, the City Administrator
or by any member of the Beer Board of the city.
      (2)   The Board is vested with full and complete power to investigate any
charges against any permit holder and to cite any permit holder to appear and
show cause why his or her permit should not be suspended or revoked.
   (B)   Complaints filed against any permit holder for the purpose of
suspending or revoking his or her permit shall be made in writing and filed
with the Secretary to the Board. When the Chairperson of the Beer Board shall
have reason to believe that any permit holder shall have violated the
provisions of the state’s Beer Act or any of the provisions of this chapter,
the Chairperson of the Beer Board is authorized to notify the permit holder of
said violations, and to cite said permit holder by written notice to appear and
show cause why his or her permit should not be suspended or revoked for such
violations at a special or regular meeting of the Beer Board. The notice to
appear and show cause shall state the alleged violations charged and shall be
served upon the permit holder either by registered letter or by a member of the
Police Department of the city. The notice shall be served upon the permit
holder at least five days before the date of the hearing. The permit holder is
required to be present in person to answer the charges and the failure of the
permit holder to appear in person will result in the immediate suspension of
the beer permit until such time as the permit holder does appear before the
Beer Board in person. At the hearing, the Board shall publicly hear the
evidence both in support of the charges and on behalf of the permit holder.
After such hearing, the Board may, in its discretion, suspend or revoke said
permit. The action of the Board in all such hearings shall be final, subject to
review by the courts as provided in the state’s Beer Law.

evidence may be heard upon any facts or circumstances pertinent to or
applicable to the charges made in the complaint.

revoke or suspend the permit of a "responsible vendor" qualified under the
requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. § 57-5-606 for a clerk's illegal sale of beer
to a minor if the clerk is properly certified and has attended annual meetings
since the clerk's original certification, unless the vendor's status as a
certified responsible vendor has been revoked by the alcoholic beverage
commission. If the responsible vendor's certification has been revoked, the
vendor shall be punished by the Beer Board as if the vendor were not certified
as a responsible vendor. "Clerk" means any person working in a capacity to sell
beer directly to consumers for off-premises consumption. Under Tenn. Code Ann.
§ 57-5-608, the alcoholic beverage commission shall revoke a vendor's status as
a responsible vendor upon notification by the Beer Board that the board has
made a final determination that the vendor has sold beer to a minor for the
second time in a consecutive 12-month period. The revocation shall be for three
years.

   (A)   The Beer Board may, at the time it imposes a revocation or suspension,
offer a permit holder that is not a responsible vendor the alternative of
paying a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 for each  offense of making or
permitting to be made any sales to minors, or a civil penalty not to exceed
$1,000 for any other offense.
   (B)   The Beer Board may impose on a responsible vendor a civil penalty not
to exceed $1,000 for each offense of making or permitting to be made any sales
to minors, or for any other offense.
   (C)   If a civil penalty is offered as an alternative to revocation or
suspension, the holder shall have seven days within which to pay the civil
penalty before the revocation or suspension shall be imposed. If the civil
penalty is paid within that time, the revocation or suspension shall be deemed
withdrawn. Payment of the civil penalty in lieu of suspension or revocation by
a permit holder shall be an admission by the holder of the violation so charged
and shall be paid to the exclusion of any other penalty that the city may
impose.

pay to the city the sum of $250 for use in offsetting the expenses of
investigating the applicant to determine whether a permit shall be issued.

discretion of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen of the city. Any applicant for a
renewal of an existing permit shall not be required to pay this fee. Any
application for a change in location shall be required to pay this fee.

sound level meter using the “A” weighing network. The unit of measurement of
the Db(A).
            AMBIENT NOISE. The all-encompassing noise associated with a given
environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many sources, near and
far.
            BAND PRESSURE LEVEL. Of sound for a specified frequency band, the
sound pressure level for the sound contained within the restricted bank. The

BEL is restricted to levels of quantities proportional to power.
            CYCLE. The complete sequence of values of a periodic quantity that
occur during a period.
            DECIBEL. One-tenth of a bel and is a unit of level when the base of
the logarithm is the tenth root of ten and the quantities concerned are
proportional to power.
            EMERGENCY WORK. Work made necessary to restore property to a safe
condition following a public calamity or work required to protect persons or
property from any imminent exposure to danger.
            FREQUENCY. Of a function periodic in time, the reciprocal of the
primitive period. The unit is the cycle per unit time and must be specified.
            MICROBAR. A unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics and is
equal to one dyne per square centimeter.
            PERIOD. Of a periodic quantity, the smallest increment of time for
which the function repeats itself.

pressure, which pressure must be explicitly stated.
            SPECTRUM. A function of time and is a description of its resolution
into components, each of different frequency and usually of different amplitude
and phase and is also used to signify continuous range of components usually
wide in extent within which waves have some specified characteristics such as
“audio frequency spectrum” and is also applied to functions of variables other
than time.
         (b)   All technical definitions are in accordance with the American
Standards S11-1960 entitled Acoustical Terminology.
      (2)   Classification of use districts, residential, industrial,
commercial. For the purpose of this section, the reference to “residential”
shall include areas of the city zoned R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5 and any
subsequent residential or office zone created by ordinance; “commercial” shall
include areas of the city zoned AG, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, M-1, M-2 and M-3. It
shall be unlawful to project a sound or noise excluding noise emanating from
cars, trucks or motorcycles from one property into another, within the boundary
of a use district which exceeds either the limiting noise spector set forth in
Table I below, or exceeds the ambient noise level by more than three decibels.

meeting the response specification. Calibration check shall be made of the
system at the time of any noise measurement. Measurements recorded shall be
taken so as to provide a proper representation of the noise source. The
microphone during measurement shall be positioned so as not to create any
unnatural enhancement or diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen for the
microphone shall be used when required. Traffic, aircraft and other
transportation noise sources and other background noises shall not be
considered in taking measurements, except where such background noise
interferes with the primary noise being measured.
            2.   The slow meter response of the sound level meter shall be used
in order to best determine that the average amplitude has not exceeded the
limiting noise spectra set forth in Table I below.
            3.   The measurement shall be made at the property line of the
property on which such noise is generated or perceived, as appropriate, five
feet above ground.

(2011 Code, § 11-901)
§ 11-902 PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The Board of Mayor and Aldermen of the city has determined that
juveniles have been causing general disturbances to residents, and contributing
to an excessive number of incidents of damage to private and public property
and disturbances of the peace.
   (B)   The city’s Board of Mayor and Aldermen determines that special and
extenuating circumstances presently exist within the city that call for special
regulation of minors within the city in order to protect them from each other
and from other persons on the street during the nocturnal hours, and to aid in
crime prevention, to promote parental supervision and authority over minors and
to decrease juvenile crime rates.
   (C)   In accordance with the prevailing community standards, this chapter
serves to regulate the conduct of juveniles on streets during nocturnal hours
and those hours prohibited by any applicable state law, to be effectively and
consistently enforced for the protection of the juveniles in the city from each
other and from other persons on the streets during nocturnal hours, for the
enforcement of parental control of, authority over and responsibility for their
children, for the protection of the public from nocturnal mischief by
juveniles, for the reduction in the incidents of juvenile criminal activity,
for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good, safety
and welfare.
   (D)   After further review and continuing evaluation, the Board finds that
there is justification for the purposes and findings herein to adopt this
chapter.
(2011 Code, § 11-902)
§ 11-903 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. When not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future, words in the plural number include the singular and words in the
singular number include the plural. The word “shall” is always mandatory and
not merely directory.
   CITY. The City of Spring Hill, Tennessee 37174.
   MINOR or JUVENILE. Any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years or, in
equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person 17 or less years of age.
   PARENT. Any person having legal custody of a minor:
      (1)   As a natural or adoptive parent;
      (2)   As a legal guardian; or
      (3)   As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the
court.
   POLICE DEPARTMENT. The Police Department of the City of Spring Hill, or any
officially designated precinct of said Department.
   REMAIN. To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets,
including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four
or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for
ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement
that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exemptions are
expressly defined in §
11-905 of this chapter so that this is not a mere prohibitory- or presence-type
curfew ordinance.
   STREET. A way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public
as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of time,
whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight Savings Time, generally
observed at that hour by the public in the city, prima facie the time when
observed in the city’s administrative offices and Police Department.
   YEAR OF AGE. Continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth, to (but
not including the day of) the next, making it clear that 17 or less years of
age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase “under 18 years of age”,
unless specifically defined differently herein.

§ 11-904 RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any minor between 17 and 18 years of age to

take said parent’s place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area;
   (C)   Until the hour of 12:30 a.m. if the minor is on an errand as directed
by his or her parent;
   (D)   If the minor is legally employed, for the period from 45 minutes
before to 45 minutes after work, while going directly between his or her home
and place of employment. This exception shall also apply if the minor is in a
public place during curfew hours in the course of his or her employment. To
come within this exception, the minor must be carrying a written statement of
employment issued by employer pursuant to the authorization of the Chief of
Police to expire within 90 days;
   (E)   Until the hour of 12:30 a.m. if the minor is on the property of or the

immediately adjacent thereto if the owner of the adjacent building does not
communicate an objection to the minor and the police officer;
   (F)   When returning home by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes of
the termination of) a school activity or an activity of a religious or other
voluntary association, or a place of public entertainment, such as a movie,
play or sporting event. This exception will not apply beyond 1:30 a.m. If the
event is not commercial in nature or does not have a fixed, public known time
at which it will or does end, the sponsoring organization must register the
event with the Chief of Police of the city’s Police Department (or his or her
assigned representative) at least 24 hours in advance, informing the Police
Department of the time such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it
shall be held, the time at which it shall end and the name of the sponsoring
organization;
   (G)   In the case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor’s
parent has communicated to the Police Department personnel the facts
establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a
designated time for a described purpose including place or origin and
destination. A copy of such communication, or the police record thereof, duly
certified by the Chief of Police to be correct, an appropriate notation of the
time it was received and of the names and addresses of such parent and minor
shall constitute evidence of qualification under this exception;
   (H)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise
and provide notice to city officials by first delivering to the Police
Department a written communication, signed by such minor, with his or her home
address and telephone number, addressed to the Mayor of the city specifying
when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night
during hours when the curfew ordinance is still otherwise applicable to said
minor in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such
communication;
   (I)   When a minor is in a motor vehicle; and
   (J)   Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, such
as provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided, but
here re-emphasized.
(2011 Code, § 11-905)
§ 11-906 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   A police officer of the city who has probable cause to believe that a
minor is in violation of this chapter shall:

      (2)   Issue the minor a written warning that the minor is in violation of
this chapter; and
      (3)   Order the minor to go promptly home by a direct route.
   (B)   Notwithstanding subsection (A)(1) above, a police officer who has
probable cause to believe that minor is in violation of this chapter, shall
transport the minor to the Police Department if:
      (1)   The minor has received one previous written warning for violation
of this chapter; or
      (2)   Reasonable grounds exist to believe the minor has engaged in
delinquent conduct.
   (C)   When a minor is taken to the Police Department, the minor’s parents
shall be immediately contacted. If after this contact there is still probable
cause to believe that the minor was violating this chapter, the minor shall be
held until the parent comes to take the minor home. When the parent arrives, he
or she shall be given a copy of this chapter. If no parent has arrived within
two hours, the minor shall be turned over to custody of the local juvenile
authorities until a parent can take custody of him or her.
   (D)   (1)   In case of a second violation by a minor, the Chief of Police
shall, by certified mail, send to the minor’s parent written notice of said
violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in a full
enforcement of the curfew ordinance, including enforcement of parental
responsibility and of applicable penalties. Said notice shall be sent to the
minor’s parent at his or her last known address and evidence of its mailing as
specified shall constitute sufficient notice of the minor’s violation.
      (2)   If, after the mailing of the warning notice set forth in subsection
(D)(1) above of a second violation by a minor, a parent violates §
11-904(C) of this chapter (in connection with the third violation by a minor),
this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental
offense, a parent shall be fined $25. For each subsequent offense by a parent,
the fine shall be increased by an additional $25 (e.g., $50 for the second, $75
for the third offense).
   (E)   Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter more
than two times shall be dealt with according to the juvenile laws of the state
and in accordance with the directives of the Juvenile Court of Maury or
Williamson County or such other court as shall have jurisdiction of said minor.
(2011 Code, § 11-906)
§ 11-907 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY.
   Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of the curfew
ordinance. If any provision, including, inter alia, any exception, part, phrase
or term or the application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and
the validity of the curfew ordinance in any and all other respects shall not be
affected thereby. The Board does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible
to execute or unreasonable. It is intended that the curfew ordinance be held
inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be
unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given.
The Board does not intend to violate the Constitution of the state or the
Constitution of the United States of America.
(2011 Code, § 11-907)
§ 11-908 CONTINUING EVALUATION.

this chapter through methods including, but not limited to:

of Police shall provide the Board of Mayor and Aldermen with a report
concerning the effect of this chapter on crimes committed by and against
minors, and of the number of warnings issued and arrests of minors and parents
hereunder, and such other information as Board may request; and
   (B)   After receipt of the Police Chief’s report by the Board of Mayor and
Aldermen, the Recorder shall place this matter on the Board agenda for

when they are called to respond to false alarms.

effectively and efficiently, the number of false alarms can and must be

and property/business owners to maintain the operational reliability, properly
use alarm systems, and to reduce or eliminate false alarm dispatch requests.

response, establishes fees, fines, establishes a system of administration, sets

installation company or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or
obligation, either expressed or implied, on the Police Department to respond to
any alarm. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the
failure of the Police Department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is
hereby disclaimed and full governmental immunity as provided by law is
retained. By applying for an alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges
that the Police Department response is influenced by the availability of
personnel, priority of calls, traffic conditions, weather conditions, emergency
conditions, staffing levels, prior response history and administrative actions.

vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
      (1)   Green alone or “go”.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through

without having first obtained a permit as herein required, and without
complying with the provisions of this chapter; and, it shall also be unlawful
to violate, or vary from, the terms of any such permit. Any person maintaining
pipes, lines or other underground facilities in or under the surface of any
street may proceed with an opening without a permit when emergency
circumstances demand the work to be done immediately. The person shall
thereafter apply for a permit on the first regular business day on which the
office of the Building Official is open for business.
(2011 Code, § 16-201)
§ 16-202 APPLICATIONS.
   Applications for such permits shall be made to the Building Official, or
such person as he or she may designate to receive such applications, and shall
state thereon the location of the intended excavation or tunnel, the size
thereof, the purpose thereof, the person, firm, corporation, association or
others doing the actual excavating, the name of the person, firm, corporation,

§ 16-204 DEPOSIT OR BOND.
   (A)   No such permit shall be issued unless and until the applicant therefor
has deposited with the Building Official a cash depositor surety bond. The
deposit or surety bond shall be in the sum of $5,000 if no pavement is
involved, or $7,500 if the excavation is in a paved area and shall insure the
restoration of the ground and laying of the pavement, if any. Where the amount

considered by him or her to be adequate to cover the cost.
   (B)   From this deposit shall be deducted the expense to the city of
relaying the surface of the ground or pavement, and of making the refill if

original condition, and shall be paid for by such person, firm, corporation,
association or others promptly upon the completion of the work for which the
excavation or tunnel was made. In case of unreasonable delay in restoring the
street, alley or public place, the Building Official shall give notice to the
person, firm, corporation, association or others that unless the excavation or
tunnel is refilled properly within a specified reasonable period of time, the
city will do the work and charge the expense of doing the same to such person,
firm, corporation, association or others. If, within the specified time, the
conditions of the above notice have not been complied with, the work shall be
done by the city, an accurate account of the expense involved shall be kept,
and the total cost shall be charged to the person, firm, corporation,
association or others who made the excavation or tunnel.
(2011 Code, § 16-206)

Official in accordance with the nature of the risk involved, but the liability
insurance for bodily injury shall not be less than $100,000 for each person and

§ 16-208 TIME LIMITS.
   (A)   Each application for a permit shall state the length of time it is
estimated will elapse from the commencement of the work until the restoration
of the surface of the ground or pavement, or until the refill is made ready for
the pavement to be put on by the city if the city restores such surface
pavement.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with this time limitation
unless permission for an extension of time is granted by the Building Official.
(2011 Code, § 16-208)
§ 16-209 SUPERVISION.
   The Building Official shall from time to time inspect all excavations and
tunnels being made in or under any right-of-way, public street, alley or other

more than 35 gallons capacity and weighing no more than 50 pounds for each
residential unit. Light commercial users shall furnish no more than two
containers each not to exceed 35 gallons and each to weigh no more than 50

§ 18-113 ACCESS TO PREMISES.
   Duly-authorized agents of the city shall have access at all reasonable hours
to the premises of the customer for the purpose of installing or removing city

(2011 Code, § 18-113)
§ 18-114 METER READING AND DETERMINATION OF CHARGES.
   (A)   Ordinarily, meters will be read once per month and bills rendered once
per month. However, the city reserves the right to vary this schedule if
necessary or desirable.
   (B)   (1)   Where the municipality allows more than one commercial or
residential dwelling or premises to be served through a single service line and
meter, the amount of water used by all the dwellings and premises served
through a single service line and meter shall be allocated to each such
dwelling or premises served. The water and sewer charges for each such dwelling
or premises thus served shall be computed just as if each such dwelling or
premises had received, through a separately metered service, such computation
to be made at the municipality’s applicable water and sewer rate schedule,
including the provisions as to minimum bills.
      (2)   The separate charges for each dwelling or premises served through a
single service line and meter shall then be added together, and the sum thereof
shall be billed to the name of record at the city’s Water Works.
   (C)   Readings from different meters will not be combined into one account
for billing, even if the meters are for the same premises, or for the same
consumer, or for the same type of service.

if not paid by the close of business hours on the fifteenth of each month. A
late penalty charge may be added to all delinquent accounts.
   (B)   Bills shall notify customers of the provisions of subsection (A) above
and shall contain a phone number where a city employee can be contacted
concerning questions about the bill.
   (C)   The customer shall be unconditionally responsible for payment of all
bills incurred in connection with the service rendered. Failure to receive
bills shall not prevent such bills from becoming due and payable or delinquent

customer.
(2011 Code, § 18-115)
§ 18-116 METER TESTING AND SPECIAL READINGS.
   (A)   The city will make special meter readings at the request of the
customer for a fee as provided in the schedule referenced in §
18-109 of this chapter; except that, no fee shall be charged if such special
reading discloses that an error prejudicial to the customer has been made by
the city.
   (B)   If the customer believes that a water meter on his or her premises is
not registering his or her water consumption accurately, he or she may request
a test of the meter by the city. The standard for meter accuracy is +10%.
Charges will be made for this service pursuant to §
18-109 of this chapter; except that, no charge will be made if the test
discloses that the meter is operating inaccurately in a manner prejudicial to
the customer.
(2011 Code, § 18-116)
§ 18-117 CALCULATION OF BILL WHERE EQUIPMENT FAILS.
   (A)   If the seal of the meter is broken by other than the city’s
representatives or in the event that the meter fails to register the use of
water, the customer shall be charged the amount computed using the appropriate
following formula for the period in which the meter failed to register.
      (1)   If the customer has been an occupant at the same location for three
years or more, he or she shall be charged the current rate based upon the
average consumption of the same month during the previous years of occupancy.
      (2)   If the customer has been an occupant at the same location for less
than three years, he or she shall be charged the current rate based upon the
average amount of water consumed monthly by that customer.
   (B)   If the customer demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the
city that a break in the water line on the customer’s side of the meter has
resulted in extraordinary charges for a billing period, the city may recompute
the customer’s bill using the procedures set forth in subsection (A) above.

her representative claims that the cause of such disturbance or stoppage exists
on that portion of the lateral lying between the main line and the property
line and an investigation discloses that the cause of the disturbance actually
exists in that portion of the line lying between the property line and the
structure which is served by the line, the property owner shall pay to the city
the actual cost to the city of making the investigation. If, however, upon
investigation it is found that the cause of the disturbance or disrepair is in

Construction beyond the water meter may be with materials permitted in the
Plumbing Code. All construction shall be performed by either a licensed master
plumber or a licensed utility contractor; and
      (2)   Size of sewers and materials to be used for construction. All sewer
lines eight inches or larger in size shall be constructed in accordance with
city specifications and standards. All sewer lines smaller than eight inches
shall be constructed in accordance with the Plumbing Code. All construction
shall be performed by either a licensed master plumber or a licensed utility
contractor.
   (D)   No connection to the city’s system shall be allowed unless the lines
to be connected have been installed in accordance with all applicable state and
city regulations and requirements. Lines connected in violation of this
provision without city permission may be summarily disconnected by the city.
   (E)   Should a building served by a common connection be conveyed to a new
owner, the city shall require a separate water and sewer connection from that
building to the mains in the street, except in the case of condominium or
townhouse developments.
(2011 Code, § 18-136)
§ 18-137 TWO OR MORE METERS ON SINGLE PREMISES.
   When two or more meters are to be installed on the same premises for
different customers, the city may direct that such meters be closely grouped
and clearly labeled as to which customer is served by each.
(2011 Code, § 18-137)
§ 18-138 CITY INSPECTION.
   (A)   By making application for service the customer agrees that the city
has the right to inspect the private water distribution systems, water
connections, sewage collection system and sewer connections before they are
connected to the city water and sewer systems.
   (B)   The city shall be given notice to inspect before the pipes are covered
and the systems are connected.
(2011 Code, § 18-138)
§ 18-139 LATERALS TO REMAIN CITY PROPERTY.
   All meters, meter boxes, pipes and other equipment furnished and used by the
city or its contractors in installing any water or sewer connections shall be
and remain the property of the city.
(2011 Code, § 18-139)
§ 18-140 MAINTENANCE OF PRIVATE DISTRIBUTION AND COLLECTION SYSTEMS.
   In addition to the requirements of §
18-136 of this chapter, all owners of lots on which private water distribution
and sewer collection systems are situated shall maintain such systems properly.
Failure to maintain the systems shall constitute a nuisance which may be abated
by the city.
(2011 Code, § 18-140)
§ 18-141 GENERAL POLICY RELATIVE TO EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   The city may extend or allow the extension of its water and sewer
mains, either within or outside the city, whenever it determines that it is in
the city’s best interest to do so.
   (B)   When a water or sewer line is extended at the city’s initiative, the
cost of such extension shall initially be borne by the city. However, the city
may recoup its costs, in whole or in part, by charging front footage fees at
the time of connection to the water or sewer system or by levying special
assessments on benefitted property.
   (C)   Extensions made at the city’s initiative may be done by city forces or
under a contract let by the city.
   (D)   The responsibility for and the entire cost of extending a water or
sewer line in response to a request for service by a property owner shall be
borne by that property owner, subject to the city’s reimbursement policy set
forth in §
18-145 of this chapter. This applies both to extensions made to reach property
previously unserved and extensions within new subdivisions or developments.
   (E)   The city shall normally require that, when a water or sewer line is
extended to serve previously unserved property, it must be extended completely
through that property or (if the line is extended along the street frontage) to
the far side of the property. The purpose of this requirement is to facilitate
future extensions of such utility lines to serve other properties.
(2011 Code, § 18-141)
§ 18-142 MANNER IN WHICH EXTENSIONS ARE TO BE MADE.
   (A)   All additions to the city’s water or sewer system, whether inside or
outside the city, shall be installed in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter as well as other city specifications and requirements. Among other
matters, such specifications shall govern the size of all lines, their
location, grade, materials used, manner of installation and provision for
future extensions.
   (B)   No construction on any addition to the city’s water or sewer system
shall commence until detailed plans have been reviewed and approved by the
Administrator. Such plans shall include whatever information the Administrator
deems reasonably necessary to determine whether the proposed extension complies
with all applicable city specifications and requirements.
   (C)   Water lines intended for addition to the publicly owned water system
will be allowed to connect to the system only if installed within the right-of-
way of a publicly dedicated and opened street, except that the city may accept
an offer of dedication of lines installed within unsubdivided commercial or
industrial developments if necessary easements are provided. Sewer lines shall
also be installed within public street rights-of-way wherever practicable, but
the city may accept sewer lines constructed on private property (where the
topography makes this necessary) if adequate permanent easements are provided.
   (D)   To protect street surfaces, the city may require that whenever
extensions of water or sewer lines are made to properties or within new
subdivisions, laterals be extended to all properties expected to tap on to such
water or sewer lines.
   (E)   By making application for extension to the city’s water or sewer
system, the person responsible for the extension agrees to indemnify and holds
the city harmless from all loss, cost, damage, liability or expense resulting
from injury to any person or property arising out of the extension of such
service lines.
(2011 Code, § 18-142)
§ 18-143 INSPECTION BY CITY OF WORK DONE BY OTHERS.
   (A)   All work on the extension of water or sewer lines not performed by
city forces (whether inside or outside the city) shall be subject to inspection
by the city and no new service line may be covered up until such inspection has
occurred. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, there is a demonstrated
lack of competent supervision by a contractor, the Administrator may (at his or
her option) provide constant inspection by city personnel at the expense of the
applicant.
   (B)   Inspection of a project by the city does not consist of or imply
supervision. The person requesting the extension is solely responsible for
ensuring that the projects completed according to city specifications (if the
work is not done by city forces) and may be required to rearrange or do over
any work to bring it into conformity with such specifications and requirements.
(2011 Code, § 18-143)
§ 18-144 DEDICATION OF WATER AND SEWER LINE EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   All water and sewer mains constructed and connected with the
facilities of the city pursuant to this chapter shall be conveyed to and become
the property of the city upon completion and acceptance by the city. Connection
to the system and acceptance by the city shall constitute dedication of water
or sewer main extension by the person responsible for the extension. However,
connection to the system shall not be permitted unless and until the lines have
been constructed and connected in compliance with all applicable state and city
regulations and requirements.
   (B)   Following dedication as provided in subsection (A) above, the city
shall have exclusive control of all water or sewer lines and shall be
responsible for their maintenance, repair and operation. However, the conveyor
of additions to the system shall guarantee the entire project against defective
material and workmanship for a period of 12 months from the date of completion
and acceptance of the project, including such incidental damages as may arise
from such claims.
(2011 Code, § 18-144)
§ 18-145 CREDITS FOR INSTALLING OVERSIZED LINES.
   (A)   A developer who installs or causes to be installed water or sewer
infrastructure and is required by the city to install an oversized line shall
be entitled to receive a credit against the payment of availability fees in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, an OVERSIZED LINE means any line,
tank, pump or any other element, appurtenance or facility of the city's water
or sewer system that:
         (a)   Is larger than the minimum size line, tank, pump, element,
appurtenance or facility that the city normally requires to be installed; and
         (b)   Is larger than that necessary to serve the needs of the
development installing or causing to be installed the line, tank, pump,
element, appurtenance or facility.
      (2)   The availability fees against which a credit may be taken are those
fees that are required to be paid for the development of the property to which
or in which the lines are installed. An installation of an oversized water line
entitles the developer to credits only against water availability fees, and an
installation of an oversized sewer line entitles the developer to credits only
against sewer availability fees.
   (B)   (1)   The maximum amount of credit to which a developer shall be
entitled for the installation of oversized lines shall be an amount determined
by the city that reasonably approximates the difference between the actual cost
of installing the oversized line and the cost that the developer would have
incurred had he or she been allowed to install a line that was not oversized.
      (2)   In making this determination, the city may, among other
alternatives, establish a schedule of customary and reasonable costs for
installing lines of different sizes and calculate the maximum creditable amount
by multiplying the length of the line installed times the per foot cost
differential for the oversized line.
   (C)   Credits may be taken under this section at the time availability fees
are paid. In applying credits, a determination shall first be made of the
amount of availability fees that would be required in the absence of any
credits, and then the developer may use credits for up to 50% of payment
otherwise required (subject to the maximum creditable amount determined under
subsection (B) above).
(2011 Code, § 18-145) (Ord. 21-24, passed 10-18-2021)
§ 18-146 RELATIONSHIP OF WATER SYSTEM CAPACITY TO APPROVALS FOR ANNEXATION,
ZONING, PLANNED DEVELOPMENT, SPECIAL USE, SITE PLAN, SUBDIVISION AND BUILDING
REGULATIONS.
   (A)   An application for annexation, zoning map amendment, planned
development, special use, site plan and/or subdivision, shall as part of the
application requirements perform a water system capacity analysis to be
completed by the city or its consultant engineer, to confirm sufficient water
system capacity is available to serve the domestic, fire protection, and
irrigation needs of subject property. The cost for preparing the water system
capacity analysis shall be the responsibility of the applicant. The Board of
Mayor and Aldermen may adopt by resolution and amend from time to time a fee
structure for preparing a water system capacity analysis.
   (B)   All required permits must be secured and associated fees paid in full
by applicant before the commencement of site construction work, the issuance of
building permits, or the sale of subdivision lots. Occupancy permits shall not
be issued unless all required public infrastructure has been installed
including water system improvements or a performance bond or other form of
acceptable financial surety is received by the city and authorization for the
issuance of occupancy permits is granted by the authority having jurisdiction.
   (C)   Whenever a change in use takes place on property that has previously
been connected to the city's water system and under the new use a greater
demand will be placed on the water system than was placed on this system by the
previous user (as determined by City Engineer according to
Appendix C of this code of ordinances), then no occupancy permit may be issued
for the lot or building until such time as the City Engineer has confirmed the
extent of additional capacity required including, but not limited to, an
increase in the size of the domestic service line and/or the addition or
increase in size of the fire protection or irrigation system service line and
payment in full by the applicant of all associated fees for the additional
capacity needed.
   (D)   Applicants for annexation, zoning map amendment, planned development,
site plan, subdivision and special use shall pay or cause to be paid in full
the following Water Capacity Analysis Fee for the preparation of a Water System
Capacity Analysis.

   (C)   No clearing, excavation, construction or other site disturbing work
may be undertaken on any lot or tract where one or more new sewer connections
will be required or where the proposed use of the lot or tract will result in
an increased demand on the sewer system (as determined in accordance with
Appendix C of this code of ordinances) unless the developer has secured written
approval from the City Engineer authorizing connection to the sewer system
including payment of all associated fees by applicant that is sufficient to
accommodate the proposed development.
   (D)   Subdivision final plat approval may not be granted unless the
applicant has received written approval from the City Engineer authorizing
connection to the city’s sewer system for every lot that is sufficient to
accommodate the development proposed or anticipated land use for that lot.
   (E)   No building permit may be issued for any lot where the construction
work authorized under the permit will result in the need for a new connection
to the city’s sanitary sewer system or an increased demand on the sewer system
(as determined by the City Engineer in accordance with
Appendix C of this code of ordinances).
   (F)   If a building permit is sought for a lot not previously connected to
the city’s sewer system but with respect to which sewer capacity has been
previously reserved and availability fees paid, and the use proposed at the
time the building permit is sought will place more or less demand on the sewer
system (as determined by City Engineer according to
Appendix C of this code of ordinances) than the capacity paid for at the time
capacity was reserved, then:
      (1)   If the demand of the proposed use exceeds the capacity reserved,
the building permit will not be issued until such time as a properly sized
connection is determined by the City Engineer and all associated fees paid in
full by the applicant; and
      (2)   If the demand of the proposed use is less than the capacity
reserved, a refund for excess capacity may be sought under §
18-149 of this chapter.
   (G)   Whenever:
      (1)   A change in use is made with respect to property that has
previously been connected to the city’s sanitary sewer system;
      (2)   No building permit is required to accomplish the change in use; and
      (3)   Under the new use a greater demand will be placed on the sanitary
system than was placed on this system by the previous user (as determined by
City Engineer according to
Appendix C of this code of ordinances), then no occupancy permit may be issued
for such use until the applicant has purchased required permits as determined
by City Engineer in accordance with §§
18-105 and
18-109 of this chapter.

§ 18-149 RESERVATION OF FUTURE SEWER CAPACITY.
   (A)   As the city begins to approach exhaustion of the unutilized capacity
within its sanitary sewer system, the city shall undertake to expand the
capacity of the system. No person may reserve future capacity in the system by
paying an availability fee for a specified amount of capacity reserved.
   (B)   When there is sufficient expanded system capacity that becomes
operational, any prior active capacity reservation issued by the City may be
permitted to connect to the City sanitary sewer system unless otherwise
determined by the City Engineer.

§ 18-152 FIRE HYDRANTS.
   (A)   The developers of subdivisions and unsubdivided developments, whether
inside or outside the city, may be required as a condition of connecting to the
city’s water system to install fire hydrants in accordance with city
requirements and specifications. Among other matters, such requirements and
specifications may govern the number, locations and type of hydrants required.
   (B)   The city may contract with a developer to install fire hydrants
required pursuant to subsection (A) above, but in all cases the full cost of
providing for such hydrants shall be borne by the developer.
   (C)   Connection to the city’s water system of any hydrant constructed
pursuant to subsection (A) above shall constitute dedication to the city of
such hydrant.
   (D)   All hydrants located within the right-of-way of a dedicated street or
on other city property shall be maintained by the city without charge; except
that, the city may include a hydrant maintenance charge in the fire protection
service fees charged to the county for any area served by the city outside its
corporate limits.
   (E)   Hydrants located on private property shall be maintained by the city
and a charge therefor shall be added to the customer’s bill, as specified in §
18-109 of this chapter.
   (F)   No person, other than an authorized representative of the city, may
draw water from or otherwise tamper with any hydrant.
(2011 Code, § 18-152)
§ 18-153 FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE LINES.
   (A)   Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the city may allow fire
protection service connections to be made to the city’s water lines.
   (B)   All fire protection service connections shall be made in accordance
with city requirements and specifications and only after the city has reviewed
and approved detailed planning for such fire protection service lines and
facilities. Final connection to the city system shall not be made until the
Administrator has inspected and approved the installed fire protection system.
   (C)   Private fire protection systems, including standpipes, sprinkler
systems and private reservoir systems, shall be constructed and installed only
by persons properly licensed to do the work. Lateral extensions and taps shall
be made by the city, and fees shall be charged therefor as provided in §
18-109 of this chapter.
   (D)   Backflow prevention conforming to city specifications shall be
installed at such points in the fire protection system’s necessary to assure
protection of the water supply.
(2011 Code, § 18-153)
§ 18-154 METERING OF FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE LINES.
   (A)   The city may require the owner of any fire protection line to install,
at his or her expense, either a detection check valve with bypass meter or a
full flow fire line meter. Such a valve or meter may be required upon the
initial connection of the fire line to the city’s system and shall be required
if the city subsequently has reason to believe that unmetered water is being
lost or used for other than fire protection purposes from any such line.
   (B)   (1)   When a detector check meter indicates usage of water for other
than fire protection, the owner shall be required, at his or her expense, to
furnish and install a full flow meter of approved design.
      (2)   Such meter shall be arranged to meter all water supplied to the
premises for all purposes, including fire protection.

§ 18-155 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The remainder of this chapter is designed to enable the city to comply
with all applicable requirements and mandates of the federal and state water
pollution control programs.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction into the city’s wastewater system of
pollutants that will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate
the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction into the city’s wastewater system of
pollutants that will pass through the system inadequately treated into
receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system; and
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the city’s
wastewater system.
   (C)   (1)   Many of the provisions of the remainder of this chapter
explicitly apply only to industrial wastes.
      (2)   The remaining provisions apply to wastes of all types, but, as a
practical matter, only industrial wastes are likely to be affected by them in
most instances.

under §
18-104 of this chapter:
      (1)   Advise the user of the violation; and
      (2)   Develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the
violation.
(2011 Code, § 18-157)
§ 18-158 FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   (1)   Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment
standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if
more stringent that limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that
subcategory shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
chapter.
      (2)   The Administrator shall notify all affected users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12.
   (B)   (1)   If the city’s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent
removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may
apply to DHE for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment
standards.
      (2)   CONSISTENT REMOVAL shall mean reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken when measured according to
the procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7(c)(2), General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to
the Act.
(2011 Code, § 18-158)
§ 18-159 WAIVER OF DISCHARGE LIMITATIONS.
   With the approval of DHE, a recipient of a significant industrial user’s
discharge permit may be allowed to discharge into the POTW wastes that exceed
some of the limitations set forth above if the Administrator determines that it
is in the city’s best interest to allow the deviation and the POTW will not be
adversely affected. Any waiver granted in accordance with this section shall be
considered a temporary measure, shall not ripen into a vested right, and may be
revoked by the city at any time.
(2011 Code, § 18-159)
§ 18-160 DILUTION OF DISCHARGE TO MEET STANDARDS PROHIBITED.

materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user’s own cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be
approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users
shall complete such a plan by 1-1-1987. No user who commences contribution to
the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have
been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of
the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration
and volume, and corrective actions.
   (B)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Administrator a detailed written report describing the cause of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or
suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
(2011 Code, § 18-161)
§ 18-162 PRELIMINARY TREATMENT FACILITIES.
   (A)   To equalize flows and to avoid temporary overloads, any person who
discharges into the city’s sanitary sewer system waste having a volume in
excess of 50,000 gallons in any 24-hour period may be required by the city to
construct suitable storage tanks or equivalent devices according to city
specifications relating to type of construction, storage capacity and similar
matters. The control of the volume of discharges of waste shall be by a
waterworks type rate controller or equivalent device, the setting and
operations of which shall be subject to the reasonable direction of the
Administrator.
   (B)   Whenever the total volume of wastes to be discharged by any person in
any one day has considerable variation in pollutional value, such person may be
required to construct holding or storage tanks in order to control the
discharge of wastes over a 24-hour period. Such tanks shall be in duplicate and
be so equipped as to mix the waste so thoroughly that its quality will be
uniform when discharged into the sanitary sewer system.
   (C)   Grease, oil and sand or mud interceptors shall be provided when, in
the opinion of the Administrator, they are necessary for the proper handling
and control of liquid wastes containing grease, oil, sand or mud in excessive
amounts. Such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units, but may be required for industrial or commercial
establishments, public eating places, hotels, hospitals, automobile service
stations, car washes or other institutions. Such interceptors shall be located
as to be readily accessible for cleaning and inspection and shall be maintained
by the owner at his or her expense in continuously efficient operation at all
times.
   (D)   Plans, specifications and other pertinent information relating to
proposed preliminary treatment or handling facilities, including the
construction of storage tanks, inspection or control manholes, and controlling
devices as required under this section, shall be submitted to the Administrator
for approval, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until
such approval is obtained in writing.
   (E)   Where preliminary treatment or handling facilities are provided for
any purpose, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at his or her own expense.
(2011 Code, § 18-162)
§ 18-163 INSPECTION MANHOLE.
   (A)   Any person discharging industrial wastes into the city’s sanitary
sewer system may be required to construct and maintain a suitable inspection or
control manhole either downstream from any treatment or storage facility or, if
such facilities are not required, at or before the point where the wastes enter
the sanitary sewer.
   (B)   Such manhole shall be located and constructed in a manner approved by
the Administrator and shall contain the equipment determined by the
Administrator to be necessary for proper sampling and control of waste
discharges.
(2011 Code, § 18-163)
§ 18-164 DETERMINATION OF CHARACTER AND CONCENTRATION OF WASTES.
   (A)   Industrial waste discharged into the city’s sanitary sewer system
shall be subject to periodic inspection to determine the character and
concentration of such waste, and the Administrator shall conduct such
inspections as often as deemed reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with
the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   By making application of sanitary sewer service the industrial waste
customer agrees that duly-authorized and identified city employees shall be
permitted to enter the premises under the customer’s control to carry out the
inspections required in subsection (A) above. Whenever feasible, the city shall
notify the customer before carrying out such inspections.
   (C)   Inspections made pursuant to subsection (A) above do not relieve the
person discharging wastes into the sanitary sewer system of responsibility for
any loss, damage or penalty resulting from the discharge of such wastes into
the sanitary sewer system.
   (D)   Samples taken as part of the inspections authorized by this section
shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the actual quality
of the waste. Laboratory methods used in the examination of such waste shall be
those set forth in Standard Methods, as hereinbefore described, a copy of which
is on file at the office of the Administrator for inspection by interested
parties.
(2011 Code, § 18-164)
§ 18-165 AUTHORITY FOR TEMPORARY EXCLUSION.
   Authority is hereby given to the Administrator to exclude temporarily any
industrial waste, whether pretreated or not, from the sanitary sewers whenever,
in his or her opinion, such action is necessary for the purpose of determining
the effects of such wastes upon any part of the sewage treatment system.
(2011 Code, § 18-165)
§ 18-166 PERMIT REQUIRED FOR DISCHARGE OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES BY SIGNIFICANT
USERS.
   (A)   Subject to subsection (B) below, no significant industrial user may

of the introduction of wastewater in the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment
standards and requirements shall submit to the Administrator a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from
the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and
requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in
the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or
requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into
compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial
user, and certified to by a qualified professional.
   (B)   (1)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the
compliance date of such pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the
Administrator during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Administrator, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include
a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the
average daily flow reported in subsection (A) above.
      (2)   At the discretion of the Administrator and in consideration of such

§ 18-179 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The enforcement remedies specified in this section are in addition to
those set forth in §
18-104 of this chapter.
   (B)   The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a
significant industrial user’s discharge permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the Administrator, to stop an actual or threatened
discharge that:
      (1)   Presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the
health or welfare of persons or the environment;
      (2)   Causes interference to the POTW; or
      (3)   Causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
   (C)   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall
reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the
elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city
within 15 days of the date of the occurrence.
   (D)   A significant industrial user’s discharge permit may be revoked by the
Administrator if he or she finds that the user has violated any of the
provisions of this chapter or any condition included in a permit issued under
this chapter. Before revocation, the user shall be given 30 days’ written
notice of the intent to revoke the permit and an opportunity to appear before
the Administrator to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. A
decision to revoke the permit may be appealed in the manner set forth in §
18-172 of this chapter.
   (E)   The city shall annually publish in a newspaper having general
circulation in the city a list of the users that were not in compliance with
any pretreatment requirement or standards at least once during the 12 previous
months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken
against the user(s) during the same 12 months.
(2011 Code, § 18-179)
§ 18-180 SURCHARGES FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (A)   Customers discharging industrial wastes into the city’s sanitary sewer
system may be subject to surcharges that reflect the additional treatment
demands of industrial wastes. Therefore, the amount of an industrial waste
customer’s bill may depend upon the character and concentration of the wastes
discharged as well as the quantity. Charges will be in accordance with the
schedule of rates set forth in §
18-111 of this chapter.
   (B)   The volume of flow used in determining the total discharge of
industrial wastes shall be based upon metered water consumption as shown in the
records of meter readings maintained by the Administrator.
   (C)   In the event that a person discharging wastes into the sanitary sewers
produces evidence satisfactory to the Administrator that more than 10% of the
total volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the sanitary sewers,
then the Administrator and the customer may agree to use an estimated
percentage of total water consumption as a basis for calculation of sewer use
charges. Alternatively, the city may agree to authorize on such premises an
additional water meter through which water passes that is not returned to the
city’s sewer system and to charge only a water service fee for this water (and
not a sewer service fee).
   (D)   Where a person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
procures all or any part of his or her water supply from sources other than the
city, the person so discharging such waste shall install and maintain, at his
or her own expense, water meters of a type approved by the Administrator for
the purpose of determining the proper volume of industrial waste discharged to
such sewers.

§ 18-305 BACKFLOW PREVENTION AND CROSS-CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to cause a cross-connection,
auxiliary intake, bypass or inter-connection to be made, or allow one to exist
for any purpose unless the construction and operation of same has been approved
by the general manager and the state, and the operation of such cross-
connection, auxiliary intake, bypass or inter-connection is at all times under
the direction of the general manager.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful to install or allow any unprotected takeoffs from
the water service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located
directly after the service connection, to a customer’s water system.
   (C)   Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued if an approved
backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter is not installed, tested
and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been
removed, bypassed, altered or not kept in proper working condition or, if an
unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be
restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. Disconnection of water
service may be in addition to any other civil or criminal penalties imposed by
law or this chapter.
   (D)   If, in the judgment of the general manager or his or her designated
representative, a backflow prevention assembly is required at a customer’s
service connection, or within the customer’s water system, for the safety of
the public water supply, the general manager or his or her designated
representative shall give notice in writing to said customer to install a
backflow prevention assembly at specific location(s) on his or her premises.
   (E)   For existing installations, the Cross-Connection Coordinator may cause
water service to be discontinued until such time as the customer complies with
all requirements of state law and this chapter.
   (F)   For new commercial or industrial construction or renovation of a
commercial or industrial property, the Cross-Connection Coordinator or
inspector shall inspect the site and review plans in order to determine the
type(s) of backflow prevention device, and notify the owner(s) in writing of
the type of required device(s). Such device(s) shall be tested immediately upon
connection to the public water system.
   (G)   The customer shall immediately install approved assembly(s) at his or
her own expense. Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to
install, and maintain such an assembly shall be cause for discontinuance of, or
refusal of, water service to the premises until such requirements are
satisfactorily met.
   (H)   For all existing customers, the Cross-Connection Coordinator or
inspector from the cross- connection office shall perform evaluations and
inspections and shall require correction of violations in accordance with this
chapter.
   (I)   No installation, alteration or change(s) shall be made to any backflow
prevention device connected to the public water supply without first securing
permission from the Cross-Connection Coordinator.

   (A)   The general manager or his or her designated representative shall have
the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by the public
water system for the purpose of inspecting the piping system therein for cross-
connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses or inter-connections or for the
testing of backflow prevention device(s). Upon request, the owner, lessee or
occupant of any property so served shall furnish any pertinent information
regarding the piping system on such property. Refusal of such information or
refusal of access, when requested, shall be deemed evidence of the presence of
cross-connections.
   (B)   When cross-connections, other structural or sanitary hazards or any
violation of this chapter becomes known, the general manager or his or her
designated representative, shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the
premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the
customer has corrected the conditions in conformance with this chapter.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Cross-Connection Coordinator that at any
premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed on internal
pipelines carrying potable water, waste water, process water or any other
liquid, gas or undesirable substance, to have certified inspections and
operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the
Cross-Connection Coordinator deems the hazard to be great enough, inspections
may be required at more frequent intervals.
   (D)   All inspections, tests and repairs shall be at the expense of the
customer and shall be performed by a person certified by the state and has the
authority from the water purveyor. It shall be the duty of the general manager
or his or her designated representative to see that these tests, or repairs are
made in a timely manner. Assemblies found to be defective shall be repaired,
overhauled or replaced at the expense of the customer. Copies of all records of
tests, repairs and overhaul shall be supplied to the cross-connection control
office for retention.
   (E)   Failure to maintain a backflow prevention device in proper working
order shall be grounds for discontinuance of water service. The removal,
bypassing or altering of a protective device or the installation thereof so as
to render a device ineffective shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of
water service. Water service to such premises shall not be restored until the
customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or defects to the
satisfaction of the general manager or his or her designated representative.
(2011 Code, § 18-306) (Ord. 06-45, passed 9- -2006)
§ 18-307 CORRECTIONS OF VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Any customer having cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses or
inter-connection(s) in violation of this chapter shall, after a thorough
investigation of existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required,
complete the work within the time designated by the Cross-Connection
Coordinator, but in no case shall the time for correction exceed 90 days.
   (B)   Failure to comply with any order of the general manager or his or her
designated representative within the time set out therein shall result in the
termination of water service.
   (C)   Where cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses or inter-
connections are found to constitute an extreme hazard of immediate concern of
contaminating the public water system, the general manager or his or her
designated representative shall require immediate corrective action be taken to
eliminate the threat. Expeditious steps shall be taken to disconnect the public
water system from the customer’s piping systems unless the extreme hazard is
corrected immediately.
   (D)   Upon written request by the customer, the general manager shall
provide a hearing regarding any order of termination or refusal of water
service; provided, however, that, when an order is issued pursuant to
subsection (C) above, such hearing may be held after such termination or
refusal, but not later than five working days after receipt of the request. Any
customer aggrieved by such an order may appear in person, or by legal counsel,
and show cause why an order to terminate water service, or to refuse water
service, should be rescinded.
   (E)   Failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public
water system as prohibited by this chapter or Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-221-711
within the time limits set by the general manager or this chapter, shall be
cause for denial or termination of water service. If proper protection is not
provided after a reasonable time, the general manager or his or her designated
representative shall give the customer written notification that water service
is to be discontinued, and thereafter physically separate the public water
system from the customer’s system in such manner that the two systems cannot
again be connected by an unauthorized person.

   FOOD SERVICE FACILITIES. Those establishments primarily engaged in
activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption
foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities:
cooking by frying (all methods); baking (all methods); grilling; sauteing;
rotisserie cooking; broiling (all methods); boiling; blanching; roasting;
toasting; or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing
and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non-drinkable food
product in or on a receptacle that requires washing. These facilities include
restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing plants
or any other sewer users as determined by the city’s Wastewater Collection
System Superintendent (WCSS) who discharge applicable waste.
   GREASE. Material composed primarily of fats, oil and grease (FOG) from
animal or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil and grease shall be deemed as
grease by definition. GREASE does not include petroleum based products.
   GREASE TRAP. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and
grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also serve to
collect settlable solids, generated by and from food preparation activities,
prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection
and treatment system.
   OIL/WATER SEPARATOR. An approved and industry standard system that is
specifically designed and manufactured to separate oil from water. The system
shall allow the oil to be collected and removed on a regular basis as to
prevent it from being discharged into the wastewater collection system. Only
OIL/WATER SEPARATORS manufactured for that specific operation will be approved.
Adequate support literature from the manufacturer will be required so as to
allow a proper review by the WCSS.
   USER. Any person or establishment including those located outside the
jurisdictional limits of the city who contributes, causes or permits the
contribution or discharge of wastewater into the city’s wastewater collection
or treatment system, including persons who contribute such wastewater from
mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
(2011 Code, § 18-402) (Ord. 06-05, passed 3- -2006)
§ 18-403 CONTROL PLAN FOR FOG AND FOOD WASTE.
   (A)   Any new construction, renovation or expansion of food service
facilities shall be required to submit to the city a FOG and food waste control
plan that will effectively control the discharge of undesirable materials into
the wastewater collection system.
   (B)   (1)   Any existing food service facilities shall also be required to
submit a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively control the
discharge of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.
      (2)   Existing facilities shall not be exempt from the requirements of
this chapter.
      (3)   There will be no “grandfathering”.
(2011 Code, § 18-403) (Ord. 06-05, passed 3- -2006)
§ 18-404 GENERAL CRITERIA.
   (A)   Installation requirements. All existing, proposed or newly remodeled
food service facilities inside the city’s wastewater service area shall be
required to install, at the user’s expense an approved, properly operated and
maintained grease trap.
   (B)   Sanitary sewer flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals,
lavatories and the like shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These
flows shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
   (C)   Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential
to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
   (D)   Garbage grinders/disposers. It is recommended that solid food waste
products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a
grinder/disposal is used, it must be connected to the grease trap. The use of
grinders is discouraged since it decreases the operational capacity of the
grease trap and will require an increased pumping frequency to ensure
continuous and effective operation.
   (E)   Dishwashers. Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease
trap. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water, which can melt grease and allow
it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized accordingly
to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify
and float to the top of the trap.
   (F)   Location. Grease trap shall be installed outside the building upstream
from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow easy access
for inspection, cleaning and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. A
grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building without written
approval by the WCSS.
   (G)   Pass through limits. No user shall allow wastewater discharge
concentration from grease trap to exceed 100 MgPL (milligrams per liter) as
identified by EPA Method 1664.
(2011 Code, § 18-404) (Ord. 06-05, passed 3- -2006)
§ 18-405 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Construction. Grease traps shall be constructed in accordance with the
city’s standards and shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings
designed for grease retention. All grease removal devises or technologies shall
be subject to the written approval of the WCSS. Such approval shall be based on
demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology.
   (B)   Access. Access to grease traps shall be available at all times, to
allow for their maintenance and inspection. Access to trap shall be provided by
two manholes (one on each compartment) terminating at finished grade with cast
iron frame and cover.
   (C)   Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease trap shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing
capacity. (Example: vehicular traffic in driving or parking areas.)
   (D)   Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to a grease trap shall
enter only through the inlet pipe of the trap. Each grease trap shall have only
one inlet and one outlet pipe.
   (E)   Grease trap sizing. The required size of the grease trap shall be
calculated using EPA-2 model. All grease traps shall have a capacity of not
less than 1,000 gallons, nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. If the
calculated capacity exceeds 3,000 gallons, multiple units plumbed in series
shall be installed.
(2011 Code, § 18-405) (Ord. 06-05, passed 3- -2006)
§ 18-406 GREASE TRAP MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Cleaning/pumping.
      (1)   The user, at the user’s expense, shall maintain all grease traps to
assure proper operation and efficiency and maintain compliance with the city’s
pass through limits. Maintenance of grease trap shall include the complete
removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom
sludge and solids. This work shall be performed by a qualified and licensed
hauler. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the trap from which
it was removed or any other grease trap, for the purpose of reducing the volume
to be disposed, is prohibited.
      (2)   This service shall also include a thorough inspection of the trap
and its components. Any needed repairs shall be noted. Repairs shall be made at
user’s expense.
   (B)   Cleaning/pumping frequency. The grease trap must be pumped out
completely a minimum of once every four months, or more frequently, as
determined by the WCSS, as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the
sanitary sewer system.
   (C)   Disposal.
      (1)   All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed of at a
facility approved to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of
this program. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public
portion of the city’s sanitary sewer collection system.
      (2)   All pumpage from grease traps must be tracked by a manifest, which
confirms pumping, hauling and disposal of waste. The customer must obtain and
retain a copy of the original manifest from the hauler.
   (D)   Maintenance log. A grease trap cleaning/maintenance log indicating
each pumping for the previous 24 months shall be maintained by each food
service facility. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler
and disposal site and shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection.
Said log shall be made available to the WCSS or his or her representative upon
request.
   (E)   Submittal of records.

WCSS on a biannual basis (twice per year). Records shall be submitted by March
1 and September 1 of each year. The records shall be submitted to:
            Attn. Wastewater Collection System Superintendent
            199 Town Center Parkway
            Spring Hill, Tennessee 37174
      (3)   The WCSS will perform periodic inspections of these facilities and
shall notify the user of any additional required maintenance or repairs. Upon
written notification by the WCSS, the user shall be required to perform the
maintenance and records of said maintenance within 14 calendar days. Upon
inspection by the WCSS the user may be required to install, at his or her
expense, additional controls to provide a complete system which prevents
discharges of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.

separators. These systems shall be sized to effectively remove sand, soil and
oil at the expected flow rates. These systems shall be, at the user’s expense,
cleaned or pumped on a regular basis to prevent impact upon the wastewater
collection and treatment systems. Users whose systems are deemed to be
ineffective by the WCSS shall be asked to change the cleaning frequency, or to
increase the size of the system. Owners or operators of washing facilities will
be required to prevent the inflow of detergents and rainwater into the
wastewater collection system. Oil/water separator installations shall be
required at facilities that accumulate petroleum oils and greases and at
facilities deemed necessary by the WCSS.

      (2)   Beginning July 1, 2026 an escalation of $0.25 or an amount
equivalent to the consumer price index, all urban consumers parent of
inflation, whichever is greater shall be added annually to both residential and
commercial customers.
(2011 Code, § 18-508) (Ord. 09-39, passed 12- -2009; Ord. 09-42, passed - -
2009; Ord. 23-04, passed 5-1-2023)
§ 18-509 PROPERTY CLASSIFICATION FOR STORM WATER USER FEES.
   (A)   Property classifications. For purposes of determining the storm water
user fee, all properties in the city are classified into one of the following
categories:
      (1)   Single-family residential property;
      (2)   Other developed property;
      (3)   Vacant/undeveloped property;
      (4)   Agricultural property; or
      (5)   Exempt property.
   (B)   Single-family residential fee. The Board finds that the intensity of
development of most parcels of real property in the city classified as single-
family residential is similar and that it would be excessively and
unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the
impervious surface on each such parcel. Therefore, all single-family
residential properties in the city shall be charged a flat storm water user
fee, equal to the ERU base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or the
impervious surface area of the improvements, except as provided herein. Single-
family residential property in which the impervious surface exceeds 10,000
square feet, including any detached accessory structures, shall be charged the
same as the fee for other developed property.
   (C)   Other developed property fee. The fee for other developed property
(i.e., non-single- family residential property) in the city shall be the base
rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total
impervious area (square feet) of the property by one ERU. The minimum storm
water user fee for other developed property shall equal the base rate for a
single-family residential property.
   (D)   Vacant/undeveloped property fee. The fee for vacant/undeveloped
property in the city shall be as follows:
      (1)   If the property contains less than 1,800 square feet of impervious
surface, then no storm water user fee shall be charged; and
      (2)   If the property contains 1,800 square feet or more of impervious
surface, then property shall be charged based on the amount of impervious
surface as other developed property, with the minimum charge being the single-
family residential fee.
   (E)   Agricultural property. The fee for agricultural property in the city
shall be as follows.
      (1)   If the property contains impervious surface in an amount equal to
or less than the average ERU, then the minimum storm water user fee for such
property shall equal the base rate for a single-family residential property.
      (2)   If the property contains impervious surface in an amount greater
than the average ERU, then the property shall be charged in the same manner as
other developed property.
   (F)   Exempt property. There shall be no storm water user fee for exempt
property or as otherwise provided by state law.

Editor’s note:
   Storm water user fees are on file in the office of the City Recorder.
§ 18-510 BASE RATE.
   The Board shall, by ordinance in the fee schedule as adopted by the Board,
establish the base rate for the ERU. The base rate shall be calculated to
ensure adequate revenues to fund the costs of storm water management and to
provide for the operation, maintenance and capital improvements of the storm
water system in the city.
(2011 Code, § 18-510) (Ord. 09-39, passed 12- -2009)
§ 18-511 PROPERTY OWNERS TO PAY CHARGES.
   (A)   The owner of each property shall be obligated to pay the storm water
user fee as provided in this chapter; provided, however, that, if no water or
sewer service is being provided at the property to the owner as a customer of
record and such service is being provided to a customer of record other than
the owner, it shall be presumed that the owner and such customer of record have
agreed that the customer of record shall be obligated to pay such storm water
user fee. If the customer of record other than the owner refuses to pay the
storm water user fee, the owner of each developed property shall be obligated
to pay the storm water user fee as defined in this chapter.
   (B)   Non-residential multi-tenant properties shall be billed according to
the placement of utility meters (i.e., if the property contains individual unit
meters), then billing for the storm water user fee shall be billed to
individual units based on the unit’s pro rata percentage of impervious surface.
If the multi-tenant property contains a master meter, then the storm water user
fee for the entire impervious surface area shall be billed to the customer of
record for such master meter.
   (C)   Each unit of a multi-tenant residential building shall be billed a
minimum charge, the same being the single-family residential fee, to the
customer of record for the unit. If an individual unit is not individually
billed for any water or sewer service (i.e., water and sewer utilities are
billed to a master meter), then the customer of record for the master meter
shall be billed as other developed property based on the total impervious
surface area.
(2011 Code, § 18-511) (Ord. 09-39, passed 12- -2009)
§ 18-512 BILLING PROCEDURES AND PENALTIES FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   (A)   Rate and collection schedule. A storm water user fee shall be set at a
rate as set forth in the storm water user fee schedule as adopted by the Board
of Mayor and Aldermen by ordinance, collected at a location and collected on a
schedule, established in accordance with this chapter. The storm water user fee
shall be billed and collected monthly with the monthly utility services bill
for those properties within the corporate limits. The storm water user fee for
those properties utilizing city utilities is part of a consolidated statement
for utility customers, which is generally paid by a single payment to the
city’s Utility Department. The storm water user fee for those properties
utilizing utilities not provided by the city shall be billed and collected by
the city annually or as directed by the city’s Finance Department. All bills
for the storm water user fee shall become due and payable in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the applicable Utilities Department pertaining to
the collection of the storm water user fees.
   (B)   Delinquent bills. The storm water user fee shall be considered
delinquent if not received by the city by the due date stated in the utility
statement and subsequent late fees shall be imposed as set forth in the fee
schedule as adopted by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen as established by an
ordinance.
   (C)   Penalties for late payment; failure to pay. Storm water user fees
shall be subject to a late fee established by ordinance as indicated in the
storm water user fee schedule. The city shall be entitled to recover collection
fees and attorney's fees incurred in collecting delinquent storm water user
fees. The city or other collecting utility provider may discontinue utility
service to any storm water user who fails or refuses to pay the storm water
user fees and may refuse to accept payment of the utility bill from any user
without receiving at the same time, payment of the storm water user fee charges
owed by such user and further may refuse to re-establish service until all such
fees have been paid in full.
   (D)   Mandatory statement. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-221-1112, each
bill that shall contain storm water user fees shall contain the following
statement in bold: “THIS TAX HAS BEEN MANDATED BY CONGRESS”. Although the
mandatory statement will be placed on each bill, the city’s Board of Mayor and
Alderman hereby finds and declares that the storm water user fee is a utility
service fee and not a tax.

§ 18-513 APPEALS OF FEES.
   (A)   Any person who disagrees with the calculation of the storm water user
fee, as provided in this chapter, may appeal such fee determination to the
Storm Water Advisory Committee within ten days after the date the payment is
due. Any appeal not filed within the time permitted by this section shall be
deemed waived.
   (B)   All appeals shall be filed in writing addressed to the Storm Water
Coordinator and shall state the grounds for the appeal and the amount of the
storm water user fee the appellant asserts is appropriate. The appeal shall
provide such information and documentation supporting the basis of the appeal.
The appeal shall be accompanied by an appeal review fee as set forth in the
storm water user fee schedule adopted by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. The
appeal review fee shall be refunded to any party who prevails in an appeal of
the calculation of the storm water user fee. As a condition to maintaining an
appeal, the appellant shall pay all charges billed under protest prior to or at
the time of the filing of the appeal.
   (C)   The Storm Water Advisory Committee shall review the appeal and
determine whether the challenged determination is consistent with the
provisions of this chapter. Appeals related to the storm water user fee shall
be decided based on substantiated evidence with a sound engineering and factual
basis. All appeal determinations shall be applied utilizing a strict
interpretation of this chapter. At any hearing related to an appeal or credit
determination, the city shall be allowed to present evidence, findings and
recommendations; appealing parties and applicants shall be given an opportunity
to present evidence, findings and recommendations. The Storm Water Advisory
Committee may request additional information from the appealing party; the
Committee may defer the determination of an appeal one time to the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Storm Water Advisory Committee. Each appeal
shall be placed on the Storm Water Advisory Committee agenda for the next
regularly scheduled meeting, which meeting is at least 20 days after the Storm
Water Coordinator receives the written appeal. The Storm Water Coordinator
shall notify the appellant customer of the date of the appeal review hearing in
writing; such written notice shall be given at least ten days prior to the
hearing by regular mail at the address provided in the written appeal document.
The decision of the Storm Water Advisory Committee shall be final and
conclusive with no further administrative review.
   (D)   If a refund is due, the Storm Water Coordinator shall authorize the
refund which will be provided as a credit against the customer’s storm water
user fee billings until such credit is exhausted.

§ 18-514 STORM WATER USER FEE CREDIT AND ADJUSTMENT POLICY.
   Storm water user fee credits and adjustments are available to other
developed property (i.e., non-single-family residential property) with
exception to a small homes credit, which is available exclusively for single-
family residential property as outlined in the Storm Water Utility Credit and
Adjustment Policy Manual, as adopted by Res. 09-113 and any subsequent
amendments.

§ 20-110 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter “person
aggrieved”) may file a complaint with the Mayor. Complaints shall be in writing
and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Mayor requires.
Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Mayor shall furnish a copy of it to the
person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to commit the alleged
discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or
within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection
(C) below, the Mayor shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing
to the person aggrieved whether he or she intends to resolve the complaints. He
or she shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory
housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation and
persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of these informal endeavors may

assist in this filing.
   (D)   If the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within 30
days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within 30 days thereafter
commence a civil action in any appropriate court against the respondent named
in the complaint to enforce the rights granted or protected by this chapter
insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If the court
finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur,
the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or order
such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complainant.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual comes to trial, the Mayor

   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the Mayor shall have access at all
reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy such
materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as
are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation. The Mayor
must comply with the provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to
unreasonable searches and seizures. The Mayor may issue subpoenas to compel
access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such
persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent to the same extent and
subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or
interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United
States District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking
place. The Mayor may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Mayor, a respondent shall be entitled
to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the
Mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas
issued by the Mayor himself or herself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a
respondent shall show, on their face, the name and address of such respondent
and shall state that they were issued at his or her request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Mayor shall be entitled to the
same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States
District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the
request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (D)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the
person may petition the Mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The Mayor shall
grant the petition if he or she finds that the subpoena requires appearance or
attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of
evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does
not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that
compliance would be unduly onerous or for other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor or other
person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in
municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the
subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts business.
   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence,
if, in his or her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order
to the Mayor shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person who, with intent
thereby to mislead the Mayor makes or causes to be made any false entry or
statement of fact in any report, account, record or other document submitted to
the Mayor pursuant to his or her subpoena or other order, or willfully neglects
or fails to make or cause to be made full, true and correct entries in such
reports, accounts, records or other documents, or willfully mutilates, alters
or by any other means falsifies any documentary evidence, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   (G)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the Mayor
participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.

§ 20-112 ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.

courts of general jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 108
days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. The court
shall continue a civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
20-110(D) of this chapter from time to time before bringing it to trial or
renting dwellings.
   (B)   Any person because he or she is or has been or in order to intimidate
such person or any other person or any class of persons from:
      (1)   Participating, without discrimination on account of race, color,
religion or national origin, in any of the activities, services, organizations
or facilities described in subsection 15(a); or
      (2)   Affording another person or class of persons opportunity or
protection to so participate.
   (C)   Any citizen because he or she is or has been, or in order to
discourage such citizen or any other citizen from lawfully aiding or
encouraging other persons to participate, without discrimination on account of
race, color, religion or national origin, in any of the activities, services,
organizations or facilities described in subsection 15(a), or participating
lawfully in speech or peaceful assembly opposing any denial of the opportunity
to so participate shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

APPENDIX A: EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND RECOVERY PLAN
CITY OF SPRING HILL BASIC RESPONSE AND RECOVERY PLAN
I.   BASIC PLAN.
   (A)   Purpose. This document establishes a framework through which the city
may prevent or mitigate the impacts of, prepare for, respond to and recover
from a wide variety of disasters that could adversely affect the health, safety
or general welfare of the citizens and visitors of the city. This emergency
operations plan outlines a method of incident management called the Incident
Command System (ICS) that includes a coordinated (multi-department and or
multi-agency) response to incidents beyond the scope of normal city operations.
Provisions are made for the needed flexibility of direction, coordination and
method of operation to enable city government to accomplish the following
specific goals:
      (1)   Minimize suffering, loss of life, personal injury and property
damage resulting from hazardous and/or emergency conditions;
      (2)   Minimize disaster related shortages and service system disruptions
that would have an adverse impact on residents, visitors and the local economy;
      (3)   Provide immediate relief and promote short-range and long-range
recovery;
      (4)   Avoid or reduce loss of life and property damage resulting from
disasters;
      (5)   Comply with state and federal disaster assistance regulations; and
      (6)   Document all disaster related expenses to ensure the fullest
possible recovery of funds in the event of a presidential declaration.
   (B)   Scope. The city’s emergency plan:
      (1)   Describes the various types of emergencies and disasters that may
occur, and provides procedures for disseminating warning and for determining,
assessing and reporting the severity and magnitude of disasters;
      (2)   Establishes the concepts under which local government will operate
during emergencies by:
         (a)   Defining the emergency role and function of city government; and
         (b)   Defining the responsibilities of city government officials.
      (3)   Create a framework for expeditious, effective and coordinated
deployment of available resources;
      (4)   Identifies functional responsibilities and actions required of city
government to obtain and implement assistance and relief on a state and federal
level, and those actions to be taken in the identification, organization and
mobilization of resources necessary to assist the city before, during and after
an emergency;
      (5)   Outlines the forms of recovery assistance available to individuals,
businesses and governments; and
      (6)   Creates a framework to promote pre and post disaster hazard
mitigation efforts.
   (C)   Assumptions.
      (1)   The city has developed and will continue to update its emergency
plans and possesses the capability to execute such plans.
      (2)   Prediction and warning systems have been established which make it
possible to anticipate some disaster situations that may affect the city.
      (3)   The city has entered into mutual-aid agreements with other local
governments, special districts and private organizations to assist during
emergency operations.
      (4)   The state possesses expertise and resources including specific
plans and procedures that may be utilized in relieving emergency or disaster
related problems that are beyond the capacity of the city.
      (5)   Should city and state resources prove inadequate to cope with
disaster demands, the Governor will request federal assistance under a
presidential declaration.
      (6)   The city has adopted the Incident Command System as its response
model for daily emergency operations through disaster response operations.
   (D)   Location. The city is located in middle Tennessee, in Maury/Williamson
Counties. Population is 24,340 (2007 census).
   (E)   Situation. The city is exposed to the effects of many hazards, varying
widely in type and magnitude. Emergency conditions could result from a number
of natural phenomena such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, summer/winter
storms, drought, fires, to include grass and forest fires, high winds, or a
combination of the above. Apart from natural disasters, the city is exposed to
technological hazards such as transportation accidents involving chemicals, oil
and other hazardous material spills, leaks or pollution problems, dumping of
hazardous waste, building or bridge collapse, utility service interruptions,
energy shortages, civil disturbance or riots, warfare or a combination of the
above. A detailed hazard analysis is provided herein.
   (F)   Definitions.
      (1)   CATASTROPHIC DISASTER. Although there is no commonly accepted
definition of a CATASTROPHIC DISASTER, the term implies an event or incident,
including acts of terrorism, which produces severe and widespread damages of
such a magnitude as to result in the requirement for significant resources from
outside the affected area to provide the necessary response. For the purpose of
this plan, a CATASTROPHIC DISASTER is defined as an event that results in large
numbers of deaths and injuries; causes extensive damage or destruction of
facilities that provide and sustain human needs; produces an overwhelming
demand on state and local response resources and mechanisms; causes a severe
long-term effect on general economic activity; and severely affects state,
local and private sector capabilities to begin and sustain response activities.
      (2)   DISASTER. The occurrence of widespread or severe damage, injury,
loss of life or property or such severe economic or social disruption that
supplemental relief assistance is necessary for the county to recover and
alleviate the damage, loss, hardship or suffering caused thereby. At the
federal level, as defined under Pub. Law No. 93-288, a disaster is any natural
catastrophe, (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, high water, wind-
driven water, earthquake, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or,
regardless of cause, any fire, flood or explosion, in any part of the United
States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient
severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to supplement the
efforts and available resources of states, local governments and disaster
relief organizations.
      (3)   EMERGENCY. The occurrence or imminent threat of a condition,
incident or event that requires immediate response actions to save lives;
prevent injuries; protect property, public health, the environment and public
safety; or to lessen or avert the threat of a disaster. At the federal level,
an emergency is defined by Title V of Pub. Law No. 93-288, § 102(1), as any
occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, federal
assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to
save lives and to protect property and public health and safety. Title V
includes authority for the President to direct federal agencies to provide
emergency assistance to save lives and protect property and public health and
safety for emergencies and other than natural disasters. Under Title V, the
President may direct the provision of emergency assistance either at the
request of a Governor (§ 501(a)) or upon determination by the President that an
emergency exists for which the primary responsibility for response rests with
the United States (§ 501(b)).
II.   ORGANIZATION. There are eight departments of city government,
organizationally configured as illustrated herein.
III.   CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS.
   (A)   This is an integrated emergency management plan based on the principle
that local government bears the initial responsibility for mitigation,
emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Only after local resources are
depleted or prove to be inadequate should the city request relief from the next
level of government. State assistance is supplied as deemed appropriate by the
Governor and as provided in the state’s Emergency Management Plan.
   (B)   When local and state resources are determined to be inadequate, the
Governor will request a presidential disaster declaration through the Federal
Emergency Management Agency based on state and local damage assessment reports.
   (C)   Phases of emergency management: there are four distinct phases of
integrated emergency management. They include: hazard mitigation; preparedness;
response; and recovery. Specifically, each is described as follows:
      (1)   Hazard mitigation. Actions taken to eliminate or reduce the degree
of long-term risk to human life and property from natural and technological
hazards;
      (2)   Preparedness. Actions taken in advance of an emergency to develop
operational capacities and facilitate an effective response in the event an
emergency occurs;
      (3)   Response. Actions taken immediately before, during or directly
after an emergency occurs, to save lives, minimize damage to property and
enhance the effectiveness and speed of recovery; and
      (4)   Recovery. Activity initiated to return vital life support systems
to minimum operating standards and long-term activity designed to return life
to normal or improved levels.
IV.   EXECUTION
   (A)   Activation of the city plan. Upon activation of the plan by the City
Administrator, the Emergency Management Director will implement increased
readiness procedures and such emergency response actions as might be necessary
to ensure the protection of life and property. For the purposes of integrated
emergency management, the city will use the following terminology to describe
its level of readiness. These readiness levels track those used by county and
state government.
   (B)   Operating conditions (OPCONs).
      (1)   These OPCON levels are declared when a pre-determined set of
criteria has been met. The City Administrator and Emergency Management Director
will assign the appropriate OPCON level, based on the situation at any given
time.
         (a)   OPCONs for the city shall be as follows:
 
OPCON Level of Readiness
5     Day-to-day operations
      Potential emergency or disaster conditions are threatening and may
      require activation of the emergency operations center (EOC) that will
4     serve as incident command post (CIP) for large or city-wide incidents or
      when multiple incidents occur within the city requiring individual CPs
      the EOC will serve as the area command. Small or localized incidents will
      be managed from a single ICP near the scene
3     Emergency or disaster conditions are possible; activation of the EOC and
      implementation of the EOP is required
2     Emergency or disaster conditions are certain; full activation of the ICP
      is required; highest level of preparedness
1     Emergency or disaster conditions are occurring; emergency response
      activities are ongoing
 
         (b)   The OPCON in effect will be that level of operational readiness

Rural/Metro Ambulance
Disaster Plan, Spring Hill
   Unless otherwise directed due to unusual circumstances, Rural/Metro-Spring
Hill EMS will report through the established incident command structure as per
the city’s Basic Disaster Plan. Appointment of specific officers and
supervisors will be dictated by this NIMS compatible system and these persons
will ultimately decide what roles will need to be filled for each specific
scenario. However, as a general rule, the following actions will occur based on
the appropriate threat/condition level.
   (A)   OPCON 5. EMS will function according to the established daily routine.
EMS units will respond to all calls for service via the EOC with the pre-
designated ALS unit and render care and transportation for patients as needed.
Additionally, EMS will provide supportive assessments and care for Fire
Department staff members on structure, vehicle or brush fires and will
participate in special event standbys and public education activities.
   (B)   OPCON 4. EMS will continue to function in the same manner as OPCON 5.
Additionally, the EMS Operations Supervisor will be notified of the situation
and other preparatory measures maybe implemented if deemed necessary. Special
event standbys and public education activities may be discontinued if the
possible threat could endanger lives, property or are generally deemed unsafe
in some manner.
   (C)   OPCON 3. EMS will continue to function in the same manner as OPCON 4.
Special event standbys and public education activities will most likely be
discontinued due to the probability of unsafe conditions. The routine, daily
chain of command will be responsible for determining whether or not the
activities should continue in the interest of public and staff safety.
Additionally, the Market General Manager will be notified of the situation and
may determine if further preparedness notifications are warranted based on the
scenario. A third ambulance will be inspected and prepared for service in case
it must be placed into service to meet the community’s needs. The MGM will
determine if notification of other Rural/Metro operations is necessary to
prepare, activate or deploy additional assets.
   (D)   OPCON 2. EMS will continue to function in the same manner as OPCON 3;
provided that, conditions permit such activities. Additionally, EMS will
appoint a staff member(s) to serve on the command staff if needed. If the
imminent threat or command determines it necessary, a third ambulance will be
manned and placed in service to respond to the community’s needs. Additional
staff, units, supplies or equipment may be requested from other Rural/Metro
operations and the MGM or command staff member will determine if activation or
deployment is necessary.
   (E)   OPCON 1. EMS will function solely at the discretion of the incident
command structure. All non-essential activities will cease and all assets will
be focused on the missions assigned through command staff. As needed, incident
command will designate or appoint staging, triage, treatment, transport and
mortuary areas and staff. These sections may be staffed or managed by EMS
members and will function in a NIMS compatible manner. The MGM or EMS staff
member assigned to the command staff will activate and deploy additional assets
from other rural/metro operations as needed. Mutual aid may be requested from
other EMS agencies as needed.

APPENDIX B: CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN
   (A)   Prior to the July 1985 announcement by General Motors Corporation that
it would locate its Saturn automobile manufacturing plant adjacent to the city,
its public facilities were adequate to serve its then population as well-as its
projected growth for a period of at least 20 years as its population-had
remained at or near 1,000 inhabitants for many years. (1980 population: 989;
1986 population: 1,094).
   (B)   The city had, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, made substantial
investments in its infrastructure including the following capital improvements:
      (1)   The construction and installation of its first sanitary sewer
system and the construction of the sewage treatment plant north of the Kedron
Road, several miles outside its then present city limits;
      (2)   The expansion and improvement of its water system including the
construction of present tank located adjacent to the City Hall, the enlargement
of the size of certain water mains and the installation of a pump to fill the
reservoir; and
      (3)   The repaving of all streets damaged by the water and sewer line
construction which included almost every street within the city limits with the
exception of U.S. Highway 31.
   (C)   It had also renegotiated its 1965 contract with the Columbia Board of
Public Utilities which furnishes the city its entire water requirements by
extending it for an additional 40 years from 1981.
   (D)   The size of the city had remained more or less constant since its
initial incorporation in about the year 1838 and its population had actually
decreased since that date. Subsequent to Saturn, the city (in most instances at
the request of the property owners involved) undertook several major annexation
programs as the result of which its pre-Saturn size of approximately 900 acres
is now approximately 3,000 acres. Its 1990 population was 1,465, a 48% increase
since the last U.S. Census of 1980.
   (E)   The residential and some limited commercial and industrial
developments and those proposed or foreseen within the annexed areas have
created demands for additions and expansions to the public facilities and
infrastructure of the city including, but not limited to, an additional fire
hall, additional water storage facilities, the improvement of certain roads,
especially Buckner Road, Kedron Road and Beechcroft Road, the acquisition of
additional police cars and firefighting equipment, fire hydrants and street
lights in new subdivisions, and eventually the construction of its own
facilities to acquire a public water supply for the city, either from
underground sources or Duck River, and the construction and operation of a
water treatment plant as well as the water lines required to connect the
eventual source of water to the treatment plant.
   (F)   Before the Saturn announcement in 1985, the police force of the city
consisted of a full-time City Marshal and one part-time police officer, which
were served by one police car. Since Saturn, the police force has increased to
eight including a Chief, Assistant Chief, Captain and five patrolers, all full-
time. The city now often maintains five police cars. The only other employees
pre-Saturn of the city were a part-time Recorder, an employee who operated the
sewage treatment plant and another employee who supervised the public water
system. The Recorder operated in a small room adjacent to the old fire hall on
McLemore Avenue. Since Saturn, the city work force, besides the police,
includes, in addition to the full-time Recorder, two full-time clerical
employees at City Hall, a Building Inspector, three maintenance employees, a
salaried Fire Chief, a sewage treatment plant supervisor and his or her
assistant, a total of 18. The position of City Judge has also been created and
filled.
   (G)   A new City Hall costing in excess of $1,000,000 has been erected and
it is necessary that it be maintained. A new fire hall has been constructed on
Beechcroft Road which was financed by a loan from the Farmers Home
Administration.
   (H)   The following is a list of the proposed capital improvements along
with their estimated costs required to serve the new developments almost all of
which have developed or will develop in areas annexed to the corporate limits
of the city since July of 1985:

   (d) Moore Lane improvement                                    $200,000
   (e) Depot Street improvement                                  $100,00
                                                                   $950,000
(2) New water storage facilities
   (a) Williamson County tank                                    $200,000
   (b) Kedron Road tank                                          $200,000
                                                                   $400,000
(3) New fire hall                                                   $100,000
(4) New fire equipment (pumper, tanker truck, rescue equipment
vehicle, extraction equipment, gear for additional firefighters and $375,000
the like)
(5) Additional police cars                                          $50,000
(6) Additional public works equipment                               $130,000
(7) Water supply and treatment plant                                $2,000,000
(8) Upgrading sanitary sewer system                                 $200,000
TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS                                               $4,205,000
 
   (I)   As stated in the introductory paragraphs, prior to July 1985, the
public facilities of the city were adequate for its purposes for the next 20
years. All of the foregoing facilities, constructed and proposed, and the
additional personnel are required because of developments since the Saturn
announcement almost all of which are in areas annexed to the city since that
time. It is anticipated that the costs of the proposed facilities will be paid
at least in part by the privilege tax on new construction to be imposed by an
ordinance and any other impact fees that may be imposed. In order to construct
some of the improvements it is anticipated that funds may be borrowed on the
full faith and credit of the city and that the taxes herein levied and any
impact fees imposed will be used as partial repayment of such indebtedness. A
portion of these costs will, of necessity, be born by the inhabitants of the
city located within its old corporate limits who will be required to help
defray the cost of the facilities which would not have been required, except
for the new developments cost of which are outside the old corporate limits.
Where the revenue realized from the privilege taxes to be imposed and any other
impact fees that might be imposed are inadequate to meet the payments on any
future indebtedness, the deficiency will be paid by the general revenues of the
city.
   (J)   The proposed improvements will be undertaken as the revenues of the
city allow. The initial priority of the projects is in the order set forth
above. The Board of Mayor and Aldermen may, at any time, by appropriate notion
or resolution, change the priority of the projected capital improvements.
