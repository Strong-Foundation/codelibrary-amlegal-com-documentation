         (b)   HOUSEHOLD means the residential premises served by the
customer’s meter. PERSONS PER HOUSEHOLD includes those persons currently
physically residing at the premises and expected to reside there for the entire
billing period. It shall be assumed that a particular customer’s household is
comprised of two persons unless the customer notifies the city of a greater
number of persons per household on a form prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor
shall give his/her best effort to see that such forms are mailed, otherwise
provided, or made available to every residential customer. If, however, a
customer does not receive such a form, it shall be the customer’s
responsibility to go to the city offices to complete and sign the form claiming
more than two persons per household. New customers may claim more persons per
household at time of applying for water service on the form prescribed by the
Mayor. When the number of persons per household increases as to place the
customer in a different allocation category, the customer may notify the city
on such form and the change will be implemented in the next practicable billing
period. If the number of persons in household is reduced, the customer shall
notify the city, in writing within two days. In prescribing the method for
claiming more than two persons per household, the Mayor shall adopt methods to
ensure the accuracy of the claim. Any person who knowingly, recklessly, or with
criminal negligence falsely reports the number persons in a household or fails
to timely notify the city of a reduction in the number of persons in a
household shall be fined not less than $200.00.
         (c)   Residential water customers shall pay the following surcharges.
Surcharges shall be cumulative:
            1.   $5.00 for the first 1,000 gallons over allocation.
            2.   $4.00 for the second 1,000 gallons over allocation.
            3.   $4.00 for the third 1,000 gallons over allocation.

         (a)   The allocation to a customer billed from a master meter which
jointly measures water to multiple permanent residential dwelling units (e.g.,
apartments, mobile homes) shall be allocated 6,000 gallons per month for each
dwelling unit. It shall be assumed that such a customer’s meter serves two
dwelling units unless the customer notifies the city of a greater number on a
form prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor shall give his/her best effort to see
that such forms are mailed, otherwise provided, or made available to every such
customer. If, however, a customer does not receive such a form, it shall be the
customer’s responsibility to go to the city offices to complete and sign the
form claiming more than two dwellings. A dwelling unit may be claimed under
this provision whether it is occupied or not. New customers may claim more
dwelling units at time of applying for water service on the form prescribed by
the Mayor. If the number of dwelling units served by master meter is reduced,
the customer shall notify city in writing within two days. In prescribing the
method for claiming more than two dwelling units, the Mayor shall adopt methods
to ensure the accuracy of the claim. Any person who knowingly, recklessly, or
with criminal negligence falsely reports the number of dwelling units served by
a master meter or fails to timely notify the city of a reduction in the number
of persons in a household shall be fined not less than $200.00.
         (b)   Customers billed from a master meter under this provision shall
pay the following surcharges. Surcharges shall be cumulative:

            2.   $4.00 thereafter for each additional 1,000 gallons over
allocation up through a second 1,000 gallons for each dwelling unit.
            3.   $4.00 thereafter for each additional 1,000 gallons over
allocation up through a third 1,000 gallons for each dwelling unit.
            4.   $2.50 thereafter for each additional 1,000 gallons over
allocation.
      (3)   Commercial customers.
         (a)   A monthly water allocation shall be established by the Mayor, or
his/her designee, for each nonresidential commercial customer other than an
industrial customer who uses water for processing purposes. The non-residential
customer’s allocation shall be approximately 75% of the customer’s usage for
corresponding months billing period for the previous 12 months. If the
customer’s billing history is shorter than 12 months, the monthly average for
the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for
which no history exists. Provided, however, customers 50% of whose monthly
usage is less than 10,000 gallons, shall be allocated 7,500 gallons. The Mayor
shall give his/her best effort to see that a notice of each non-residential
customer’s allocation is mailed to such customer. If, however, a customer does
not receive such notice it shall be the customer’s responsibility to contact
the city to determine the allocation. Upon request of the customer or at the
initiative of the Mayor, the allocation may be reduced or increased if (1) the
designated period does not accurately reflect the customers normal water usage,

purposes. The industrial customers allocation shall be approximately 90% of the
customers water usage baseline. Ninety days after the initial imposition of the
allocation for industrial customer allocation shall be further be reduced to
85% of the customer’s water usage baseline. The industrial customer’s water use
baseline will be computed on the average water use for the 12-month period
ending prior to the date of implementation of Stage 2 of the plan. If the
industrial water customers billing history is shorter than 12 months, the
monthly average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for
any monthly period for which no billing history exists. The Mayor shall give
his/her best effort to see that notice of each industrial customer’s allocation
is mailed to such customer. However, if a customer does not receive such
notice, it shall be the customer’s responsibility to contact the city to
determine the allocation, and the allocation shall be fully effective
notwithstanding the lack of receipt of written notice. Upon request of the
customer or at the initiative of the Mayor, the allocation may be reduced or
increased, (1) if the designated period does not accurately reflect the
customer’s normal water use because the customer had not accurately reflect the
customer’s normal water use because the customer had shut down a major
processing unit for repair or overhaul during the period, (2) the customer has
added or in the process of adding significant additional processing capacity,
(3) the customer has shut down or significantly reduce the production of major
processing unit, (4) the customer has previously implemented significant
permanent water conservation measures such that the ability to further reduce
water use is limited, (5) the customer agrees to transfer part of its
allocation to another industrial customer, or (6) if other objective evidence
demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate under present
conditions. A customer may appeal an allocation established here to the City
Council.

enforcement action including fines and/or removal from the self-cleaner
program.
   (D)   Cleaning schedules.
      (1)   Grease traps and grease interceptors shall be cleaned as often as
necessary to ensure that sediment and floating materials do not accumulate to
impair the efficiency of the grease trap/interceptor; to ensure the discharge
is in compliance with local discharge limits; and to ensure no visible grease
is observed in discharge.
      (2)   Grease traps and grease interceptors subject to these standards
shall be completely evacuated a minimum of every 90 days, or more frequently
when:
         (a)   Twenty-five percent or more of the wetted height of the grease
trap or grease interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the
invert of the outlet pipe, contains floating materials, sediment, oils or
greases; or
         (b)   The discharge exceeds BOD, COD, TSS, FOG, pH, or other pollutant
levels established by the POTW; or
         (c)   If there is a history of non-compliance.
      (3)   Any person who owns or operates a grease trap/interceptor may
submit to the POTW a request in writing for an exception to the 90 day pumping
frequency of their grease trap/interceptor. The POTW may grant an extension for
required cleaning frequency on a case-by-case basis when:
         (a)   The grease trap/interceptor owner/operator has demonstrated the
specific trap/interceptor will produce an effluent, based on defensible
analytical results, in consistent compliance with established local discharge
limits such as BOD, TSS, FOG, or other parameters as determined by the POTW; or
         (b)   Less than 25% of the wetted height of the grease trap or grease
interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the invert of the
outlet pipe, contains floating materials, sediment, oils or greases.
      (4)   In any event, a grease trap and grease interceptor shall be fully
evacuated, cleaned, and inspected at least once every 180 days.
   (E)   Manifest requirements.
      (1)   Each pump-out of a grease trap or interceptor must be accompanied
by a manifest to be used for record keeping purposes.
      (2)   Persons who generate, collect and transport grease waste shall
maintain a record of each individual collection and deposit. Such records shall
be in the form of a manifest. The manifest shall include:
         (a)   Name, address, telephone, and commission registration number of
transporter;
         (b)   Name, signature, address, and phone number of the person who
generated the waste and the date collected;
         (c)   Type and amount(s) of waste collected or transported;
         (d)   Name and signature(s) of responsible person(s) collecting,
transporting, and depositing the waste;
         (e)   Date and place where the waste was deposited;
         (f)   Identification (permit or site registration number, location,
and operator) of the facility where the waste was deposited;
         (g)   Name and signature of facility on-site representative
acknowledging receipt of the waste and the amount of waste received;
         (h)   The volume of the grease waste received; and
         (i)   A consecutive numerical tracking number to assist transporters,
waste generators, and regulating authorities in tracking the volume of grease
transported.
      (3)   Manifests shall be divided into five parts and records shall be
maintained as follows:
         (a)   One part of the manifest shall have the generator and
transporter information completed and be given to the generator at the time of
waste pickup.
         (b)   The remaining four parts of the manifest shall have all required
information completely filled out and signed by the appropriate party before
distribution of the manifest.
            1.   One part of the manifest shall go to the receiving facility.
            2.   One part shall go to the transporter, who shall retain a copy
of all manifests showing the collection and disposition of waste.
            3.   One copy of the manifest shall be returned by the transporter
to the person who generated the wastes within 15 days after the waste is
received at the disposal or processing facility.
            4.   One part of the manifest shall go to the local authority.
      (4)   Copies of manifests returned to the waste generator shall be
retained for five years and be readily available for review by the POTW.
   (F)   Alternative treatment.
      (1)   A person commits an offense if the person introduces, or causes,
permits, or suffers the
introduction of any surfactant, solvent or emulsifier into a grease trap.
Surfactants, solvents, and emulsifiers are materials which allow the grease to
pass from the trap into the collection system, and include but are not limited
to enzymes, soap, diesel, kerosene, terpene, and other solvents.
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to an enforcement of division (F)(1)
above that the use of surfactants or soaps is incidental to normal kitchen
hygiene operations.
      (3)   Bio-remediation media may be used with the POTW's approval if the
person has proved to the satisfaction of the POTW that laboratory testing which
is appropriate for the type of grease trap to be used has verified that:
         (a)   The media is a pure live bacterial product which is not
inactivated by the use of domestic or commercial disinfectants and detergents,
strong alkalis, acids, and/or water temperatures of 160 degrees F (71 degrees
C).
         (b)   The use of the media does not reduce the buoyancy of the grease
layer in the grease trap and does not increase the potential for oil and grease
to be discharged to the sanitary sewer.
         (c)   The use of the bio- remediation media does not cause foaming in
the sanitary sewer.
         (d)   The BOD, COD, and TSS discharged to the sanitary sewer after use
of the media does not exceed the BOD, COD, and TSS which would be discharged if
the product were not being used and the grease trap was being properly
maintained. pH levels must be between five and 11.
      (4)   All testing designed to satisfy the criteria set forth in division
(F)(3) shall be scientifically sound and statistically valid. All tests to
determine oil and grease, TSS, BOD, COD, pH, and other pollutant levels shall
use appropriate tests which have been approved by the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and which are defined
in Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136 or Tex. Administrative Code § 319.11.
Testing shall be open to inspection by the POTW, and shall meet the POTW's
approval.
(Ord. 22-0321, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 52.99 SCHEDULE OF PENALTIES.
   (A)   If the POTW determines that a generator is responsible for a blockage
of a collection system line the generator shall owe a civil penalty of $1,000
for the first violation, $1,500 for a second violation, and $2,000 for the
third violation within a two-year period. Continuous violations shall result in
an increase in penalty by $500 and may also result in termination of services.
   (B)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a written warning for the first violation, a $1,000 civil penalty
for the second violation, a $1,500 civil penalty for the third violation, and a
$2,000 civil penalty for the fourth violation within a two-year period.
Consistent violations will result in a $500 increase in civil penalty and may
result in termination of service.

particular charge does not come within the provisions of this chapter, the

voluntary compliance with provisions of this chapter. Nothing said or done in
the course of such informal endeavors may be made public by the Mayor, the
Council, the investigator, the conciliator, the charging party or the
respondent, or be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the
written consent of all persons concerned.

determination that a discriminatory housing practice has in fact occurred, if
the Mayor is unable to secure from the respondent an acceptable conciliation
agreement, then the City Council must, upon a majority vote, refer the case to
the City Attorney for prosecution in Municipal Court or to other agencies as
appropriate. With such recommendation of the Mayor and the referral of the City
Council, the Mayor shall refer his or her entire file to the City Attorney. The

subject the owner to this civil penalty.
         (b)   The finding that the owner failed to comply with the order shall
be made by the City Council, after notice to the owner of a hearing for that
purpose. The hearing will be conducted no earlier than ten days after the
notice is given. The notice may be given in person, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the last known address of the owner or by posting on the

the date of any of these actions.

the city in remedying the violations may also include the amount of the accrued
civil penalties as of the date of the filing of the lien.

penalty.

misdemeanor.

§ 132.03 EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   In the following exceptional cases, a juvenile in or upon any public
place or in and upon an establishment shall not be deemed in violation of this

parents and enforcement officials:
      (1)   When the juvenile is accompanied by his or her parent, legal
guardian or authorized adult supervisor;
      (2)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech
and the rights of assembly, whether parade or demonstration, has been permitted
by the city or other bona fide religious, social or school activities involving
the right to assemble;
      (3)   When engaged in performing an errand or other legitimate business

construed as a limitation upon normal travel by a juvenile engaged in
interstate movement.
   (C)   Each of the foregoing exceptions is severable and in addition other
possible exceptions may be added hereto in the future as warranted by
experience as illuminated by the views of student government associations,
school personnel, citizens, neighborhood spokespersons, parents, officers and
persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as juvenile
delinquency.
(Ord. 12-1101, passed 11-19-2012)
§ 132.04 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   It shall be unlawful for a parent knowingly to permit or by insufficient
control to allow a juvenile in his or her care to be or remain in any public
place or to be or remain in any establishment other than for excepted
activities during the curfew hours established by this chapter. The term
KNOWINGLY includes knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to
have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in such parent’s custody. It
shall be prima facie evidence of violation of this section if a responsible
parent has no knowledge of the juvenile’s whereabouts during the hours of
curfew established by this chapter. The purpose of this section is to require
neglectful or careless parents to meet the community standard of parental
responsibility.
(Ord. 12-1101, passed 11-19-2012) Penalty, see §
132.99
§ 132.05 BUSINESS OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
   It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of a business establishment
to allow a juvenile to remain upon such business premises during the hours of
curfew established in this chapter beyond the time necessary to conduct an
excepted activity. It shall be no defense to this section that a juvenile made
a purchase, if the juvenile did not immediately make such purchase upon arrival
and depart immediately thereafter. It shall be a defense to prosecution under
this section that the owner or operator of such business establishment has
promptly notified the City Police Department that juveniles present on the
premises after hours have refused to depart.

§ 132.06 POLICE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   A city police officer, upon finding or having his or her attention
called to any juvenile in or on a public place or in or on the premises of a
business establishment in prima facie violation of this chapter, may take the
juvenile into custody.
      (1)   Such juvenile may be transported to a juvenile curfew processing
office designated by the City Police Chief.

legal guardian or other responsible adult shall be immediately notified to pick
up such juvenile at the juvenile curfew processing office.

discretion to release such juvenile to a parent, legal guardian or other
responsible adult under circumstances deemed appropriate by the officer.

accordance with Tex. Family Code, § 52.01, and order such juvenile to go
directly and promptly to his or her home.
      (5)   Delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision
under the Tex. Family Code, §§ 51.03 and 52.01 shall be handled in accordance
with applicable provisions of the Family Code pertaining to such conduct, and
juveniles in prima facie violation of such provisions may not be taken to the
city’s curfew processing facility.
   (B)   Upon picking up a juvenile in custody, said parent, legal guardian or
other responsible adult may be questioned about the circumstances of such
activity by the juvenile. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under
constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility
for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and recording,
thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of
facilities, and, if required, referral to social agencies equipped to handle
family problems that may be disclosed by investigation. In the absence of
convincing identification, a police officer on the street may use his or her
best judgment in determining age. Police procedures shall be constantly refined
in the light of experience, and changes herein may be made on the basis of such
experience.
   (C)   In any event, a police officer shall within 24 hours file a written
report on the juvenile incident or shall participate to the extent possible in
the preparation and filing of such a report by his or her supervisor.
   (D)   When a parent, legal guardian or other responsible adult has come to
take charge of a juvenile and the appropriate information has been received,
the juvenile shall be released to the custody of the parent, legal guardian or
other responsible adult. If a parent, legal guardian or other responsible adult
cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile
shall be released to appropriate authorities; however, the Police Department
shall have the discretion to refuse to release a juvenile to an adult other
than the parent or legal guardian of the juvenile.
   (E)   A juvenile may not be held at the juvenile curfew processing office
for more than six hours. During such time, the following procedures shall be
observed.
      (1)   The office must be an unlocked, multipurpose area that is not
designated, set aside, or used as a secure detention area or part of a secure
detention area.
      (2)   The juvenile may not be secured physically to a cuffing rail,
chair, desk or stationary object.
      (3)   The juvenile may not be held longer than necessary to accomplish
the purposes of identification, investigation, processing, release to parents,
guardians or custodians, and arrangement of transportation to court.
      (4)   The office may not be designated or intended for residential
purposes.
      (5)   The juvenile must be under continuous visual supervision by a peace
officer or other person during the time the juvenile is in the juvenile curfew
processing office.

§ 132.07 CONTINUING EVALUATION.
   Ordinance shall be reviewed every third year prior to October 30 of such
year as required by Tex. Local Gov’t Code § 370.002. The first review shall be
conducted no later than October 30, 2015, and every third year thereafter. Such

§ 132.99 PENALTY.
   Prevailing community standards as reflected by this chapter require the
availability of criminal penalties in order for this chapter to be a viable
instrument for the maintenance of such standards. Consequently, violation of
this chapter by a juvenile, parent or business establishment owner or operator
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable in accordance with the general laws of
the state for municipal courts and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed
$500 for each offense. Each day constitutes a separate violation and shall
constitute a separate offense.

152.99   Penalty
§ 152.01 AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS, PURPOSE.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in the Flood
Control and Insurance Act, Tex. Water Code §§ 16.311 et seq., delegated the
responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city does ordain as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter uses the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or
sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may

A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE,
AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any

protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of

provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as
well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either: any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
or any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements, see § 60.6 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations (44 C.F.R. § 60.6.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. §§ 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in VIOLATION until
such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine

   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard with the jurisdiction of the city.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in
the current scientific and engineering report entitled, “The flood insurance
study (FIS) for Bowie County, Texas and Incorporated Areas, dated October 19,
2010, with flood insurance rate map (FIRM), dated October 19, 2010”; and any
revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter.
   (C)   Establishment of development permit. A floodplain development permit
shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions; however, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be: considered as minimum requirements; liberally
construed in favor of the governing body; and deemed neither to limit nor
repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in division (C)(2) above have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (7)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of §

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (9)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (10)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
         (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon: showing a good and
sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances; and
         (c)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (11)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that: the criteria outlined in division
(D)(1) through (D)(9) above are met; and the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety.

structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
chapter or future amendment.
      (2)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses
are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
      (3)   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or
a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
      (4)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided
that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record. In a district where single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family detached dwelling may be erected on
any lot of official record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter, irrespective of its area or width, provided that yard dimensions
and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of yard dimensions and other requirements shall be obtained only
through action of the Zoning Board.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption
of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible
under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be
continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor shall
be extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
time of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (2)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (3)   If any such nonconforming use of land cease for any reason for a
period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is
located.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built
under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may continue so long as it re mains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in any way which
increases its nonconformity.
      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not
be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in

      (2)   Appeals; hearings; notices.
         (a)   Any person aggrieved, or any official or department of the

appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any
party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
      (3)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from, unless the City Secretary from whom the appeal is
taken certified to the Zoning Board after notice of appeal is filed, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning
Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the City Secretary
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   (B)   The City Council; powers and duties. The City Council shall have the
following powers and duties:
      (1)   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination

      (2)   Exceptions; conditions governing applications; procedures.
         (a)   To hear and decide only such exceptions or temporary use permits
as the Zoning Board is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this
chapter; to decide such questions as are involved in determining whether
exceptions should be granted; and to grant exceptions with such conditions and
safeguards as are appropriate under this chapter, or to deny exceptions when
not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. An exception or
temporary use permit shall not be granted by the Zoning Board unless and until:
            1.   A written application for an exception together with fee is
submitted, accompanied by an accurate legal description, maps, site plans,
drawings and any necessary data, indicating the section of this chapter under
which the exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested;
            2.   Notice shall be given of such public hearing to the owner of
the property for which the exception is sought or his or her agent and to all
owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the subject property, such
notice to be given not less than ten days before the date set for hearing, to
all such owners who have rendered their said property for city taxes as the
ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll. Such notice may be served
by depositing same, properly addressed and postage paid, in the city post
office. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall also be given by one
publication in the official newspaper at least 15 days prior to such hearing.
Failure of owners to receive notice of hearing shall in no way affect the
validity of action taken.
            3.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in
person, or by agent or attorney.
            4.   The Zoning Board shall make a finding that it is empowered
under the section of this chapter described in the application to grant the
exception, and that the granting of the exception will not adversely affect the
public interest.
         (b)    In granting any exception, the Zoning Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable under §
155.99. The Zoning Board shall prescribe a time limit within which the action
for which the exception is required shall be begun or completed, or both.
Failure to begin or complete, or both, such actions within the time limit set
shall void the exception.
      (3)   Variances; conditions governing applications; procedures.
         (a)   To authorize upon appeal is specific cases such variance from
the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this
chapter shall not be granted by the Zoning Board unless and until:
            1.   A written application for variance together with fee is,
submitted, accompanied by an accurate legal description, maps, site plans,
drawings and any necessary data, demonstrating:
               a.   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
               b.   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
               c.   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant;
               d.   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by the ordinance to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district; and
               e.   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
            2.   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in division (B)(2)
(a)2. above;
            3.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in
person or by agent or by attorney;
            4.   The Zoning Board shall make findings that the requirements of
division (B)(3)(a)1. above;
            5.   The Zoning Board shall further make a finding that the reasons
set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the
variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of
the land, building or structure; and
            6.   The Zoning Board shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
         (b)   In granting any variance, the Zoning Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable under §
155.99.
         (c)   Under no circumstances shall the Zoning Board grant a variance
to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this chapter in said district.
      (4)   Decisions of the Zoning Board.
         (a)   In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Zoning Board may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter, reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirements, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have powers of the
administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
         (b)   The concurring vote of four of the members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the
City Secretary, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which
it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in the
application of this chapter.
   (C)   Appeals from the Zoning Board. Any person or persons, or any board,
taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the city aggrieved by any decision of
the Zoning Board may seek review by the court of record of such decision, in
the manner provided by the laws of the state.
