§ 30.03 BOARD AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS.
   The following regulations shall apply to all appointed and advisory boards
and commissions of the city.
   (A)   All board and commission members shall be appointed for two-year
terms. The regular terms shall begin and end in the month of August when the
City Council shall consider members whose terms are ending for either re-
appointment or appointing a new person to a place whose term is ending. Any
vacancy in office shall be filled by an appointment for the remainder of the
unexpired term.
   (B)   No board or commission member may serve in such appointed position or
capacity for more than six consecutive years, or until the expiration of the
term then being served. This requirement shall not preclude a person appointed
to a city board, commission, or corporation from being appointed to a different
board, commission, or corporation at any time, or to the same board,
commission, or corporation after one year has elapsed from the expiration of
such person’s previous term of office on such board, commission or corporation.
   (C)   Each position on any board or commission shall have a numbered
“place”. Odd numbered place terms shall end in odd numbered years. Even
numbered place terms shall end in even numbered years. New appointments to fill
terms vacated by persons holding a place shall serve the remaining term as
dictated by that place.
   (D)   All public meetings of boards and commissions shall be held in the
Council Chambers of City Hall. The meetings will conform to the “State of Texas
Open Meetings Act”. Written minutes and audio tapes will be prepared and kept
as public records for all meetings. Meetings may be set at other locations for
special purposes such as ceremonial or for larger or specialized audiences.
Such meetings will be the exception rather than the norm.
   (E)   Staff support will be provided through the office of the City Manager.
   (F)   Boards and commissions shall place upon their agendas an item for
selecting a chairman and vice chairman of their choosing from among their
membership. The term for the chairmanship and vice chairmanship shall run for
one-year and should be on the agenda regularly during the month of September.
Vacancies in those positions might require a second selection process.
   (G)   Boards and commissions are encouraged but not required to use a common
meeting start time of 7:00 p.m. and to establish a regular monthly meeting
date, and conduct meeting on those dates unless there is no business to
transact.
   (H)   Board and commission members are appointed by the City Council because
the members of that Council possess a belief that the individuals appointed are
earnest representatives of the citizens within this community. The City Council
expects that the appointed members will conduct themselves in an appropriate
manner and hear all sides of a proposition before reaching a decision, which
they believe represents the choice that reflects the best interest of the
community. Those decisions should be free from influence of monetary interest
and established friendships. No member of the City Council shall attempt to
demand that a board or commission member vote in a certain way on an issue that
comes before the body.
   (I)   To the extent possible, every effort should be made by the City
Council not to appoint a single individual to more than one board or
commission. In particular, to those boards or commissions which have similar
areas of concern. Elected officials shall not appoint themselves to boards and
commissions unless such appointments are required by the authorizing state or
federal statute.
   (J)   If a board member is absent for three consecutive regularly scheduled
meetings, or if a board member is absent for 25% of the regularly scheduled
meetings within a 12-month period, the position shall be declared vacant, and
the vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term by the City
Council within 30 days after the vacancy occurs.
   (K)   All boards and commissioners are subject to removal for cause as
determined by the City Council after public hearing and prior written notice
thereof.
   (L)   Citizens interested in serving on any city board, commission or
corporation shall make application to the City Council, on a form provided by
the city for such purpose. The city council shall interview all available
applicants for board and commission vacancies.
   (M)   The provisions of this section shall not preclude the removal of any
member of a city board, commission or corporation without cause by the City
Council when authorized by state law, city charter, or city ordinance.
   (N)   Every city board, commission or corporation including the board of
directors of the Ferris Economic Development Corporation and the Ferris Park
Development Corporation shall adopt bylaws governing their duties, functions,
the date, place and time of regular scheduled meetings and shad include or
incorporate by reference the attendance requirements and the grounds for
removal set forth in this section. All bylaws and amendments thereto shall be
approved by the City Council.
   (O)   Every person appointed to a city board, commission or corporation
including the Board of Directors of the Ferris Economic Development Corporation
and the Ferris Park Development Corporation shall be provided by the City
Secretary with a copy of the bylaws for such board, commission or corporation
and of this section; and shall prior to appointment, acknowledge in writing the
receipt and understanding thereof.
   (P)   Public hearings. In instances where public hearings are required to be
conducted for boards and commissions for recommendation to the City Council,
said meetings shall be conducted jointly with the City Council after satisfying
any notice procedures required by state and local governing ordinances.

§ 30.33 CODE OF CONDUCT.
   (A)   Purpose. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that the
proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and
city employees be independent, impartial, and responsible to the citizens of
the city; that no official or employee shall permit any interest, financial or
otherwise, direct or indirect, or engagement in any business transaction or
professional activity to conflict with the proper discharge of his/her duties
in the public interest: that public office or employment not be used for
personal gain beyond employment compensation; and that the City Council,
Planning and Zoning Commission, Board of Adjustments, 4A Economic Development
Commission, 4B Economic Development Commission. Park Board. Main Street Board,

member of any City of Ferris board, commission, corporation, or committee
established by ordinance, charter, state law or otherwise, operating under
direct or indirect authority or subject to the direct or indirect control of
the City Council, at all times shall be maintained as nonpartisan bodies. To
implement such a policy, the City Council deems it advisable to enact a Code of
Conduct for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or
unpaid, to serve not only as a guide for official conduct of the city’s public
servants, but also as a basis for discipline for those who refuse to abide by
its terms, the overriding interest being that officers and employees of the
city shall at all times strive to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

have been violated. A general complaint lacking in detail shall not be
sufficient to invoke the investigation procedures contained herein; and
anonymous complaints shall not be considered. The City Secretary shall provide
a copy of the complaint to the affected officer or employee and the members of

Attorney, who shall conduct an initial review of the complaint to determine if

report shall be comprehensive and explain in detail all facts, findings and
conclusions in support of the City Attorney’s opinion as to whether or not a
violation of this Code of Conduct occurred. When the City Attorney receives a
vague complaint or one lacking in detail, the City Attorney shall contact the
complainant to request written clarification or supplementation. If the
complainant fails to provide the City Attorney with written clarification or
supplementation, or if after written clarification is provided, it is the
opinion of the City Attorney that the complaint is insufficient in detail and/
or fails to allege a prima facie violation of the Code of Conduct, a written
report to that effect shall be submitted to the City Council. If the City
Attorney determines that probable cause to believe that a criminal violation
may exist, the City Attorney shall refer the matter to the appropriate law
enforcement agency.

Attorney’s report at an executive session of the City Council. The affected
officer or employee may request that the complaint be considered in a public

Conduct. The affected officer shall have the right to a full and complete
hearing before the City Council with the opportunity to call and cross-examine
witnesses and present evidence in such person’s behalf. The non-implicated

merit, or is brought for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith;
      (2)   Issue a letter of notification when the violation is unintentional.
A letter of notification shall advise the officer or employee of any steps to
be taken to avoid future violations;
      (3)   Issue a letter of admonition when the violation is minor or may
have been unintentional, but calls for a more substantial response than a
letter of notification;
      (4)   Issue a written reprimand when a violation has been committed
knowingly or intentionally;
      (5)   Remove from office an officer, other than a City Councilmember, or
terminate an employee for a serious or repeated violation of this Code of
Conduct. Removal or termination shall be in compliance with state law; or

City Council finds that a serious or repeated violation of this Code of Conduct
has been committed intentionally by a member of the City Council.

amended, the statute that regulates conflicts of interest of officers of
municipalities in the State of Texas, is hereby adopted and made a part of this

concerning the meaning or effect of any section, word, or requirement of this
Code of Conduct as it affects such person.

which the City Council has the final authority to make such appointment must
consent to a criminal history check prior to consideration of the person’s
application.
      (2)   Failure to consent to a criminal history check as required by this
section shall be grounds for disqualification for consideration for employment
and/or appointment by the City Council.
      (3)   The City shall cause a criminal history check to be conducted on
each applicant for employment or for appointment to a position described in
division (A) of this section. If upon review of a criminal history check an

ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEAKS.
   (A)   Meters generally. A customer shall receive water service only when
measured through a meter. All water meters furnished by the department shall at
all times remain the property of the city. The Director shall determine the
size, type, quantity and location of meters and connections to meters to be
installed. Each meter shall be electronically read, when reasonably possible,
once a month and a water utility bill shall be rendered accordingly. At no time
shall more than one building or one duplex unit or one single family residence
be placed on any single meter.
   (B)   Estimated bill circumstances. The quantity of water delivered to a
premises may be estimated under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   The meter reader is unable to procure a reading of the meter
because access to the meter is obstructed or made hazardous by an animal or
otherwise; or
      (2)   The meter does not properly function or the equipment used to read
the meter does not properly function; or
      (3)   Adverse weather, an act of God or other circumstance prevents or
inhibits the reading of the meter; or
      (4)   No meter is in place at the premises; or
      (5)   For some other reason, a meter reading is not available to the
billing section of the department at the time of preparing a water utility bill
to the customer.
   (C)   Basis for estimates. An estimate shall be based on past consumption
experience at the premises and adjusted for seasonal variations, or if there is
no similar past experience, then upon consumption of the same class of
customers under similar conditions. If a customer demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Director or the City Manager that an estimated bill is
excessive, then the department shall render a water utility bill for water
usage based on a revised estimate or on an actual meter reading where
reasonably possible.
   (D)   Meter reading verification. If the customer is of the opinion that
there is an error or a discrepancy for water usage on such customer’s water
utility bill, the Director will inspect the meter and verify the reading. A
verification fee, as provided in the fee schedule will be assessed to and shall
be paid by the customer unless the Director verifies that the customer’s bill
was grossly in error or that the customer has not requested more than one
verification during the previous six month period.
   (E)   Return of meters. All water meters furnished to customers are the
property of the city and shall be returned by the customer immediately upon
request of the Director. Failure by a customer to return a meter when requested

business or entity which has possession, care, custody or control of a meter
and which fails to deliver the same to the city after request to do so by the
Director, the City Manager or either of their respective designees shall be in
violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penal provisions of this
chapter.
   (F)   Maintenance of meters. The department is responsible for maintenance,
inspection and repair of all water meters rendered unserviceable through normal
wear and tear. When replacements, repairs or adjustments of any meter, meter
box, and service valve are made necessary by any act, omission, negligence or
carelessness of a customer, or any other person, business or entity, such
customer, person, business or entity shall pay all damages resulting from such
act, omission, negligence or carelessness to the department on demand and if
the same are not so paid by a customer responsible therefore, service to such
customer, owner and/or occupant shall be disconnected.
   (G)   Testing of meters. When any customer is of the opinion that the meter
through which the water is supplied is incorrect for any reason, the customer
may request that a meter test of the meter be made. The customer shall pay a
fee for the test and the new replacement meter based upon the size of said
meter, as provided in the fee schedule. When the Director receives the results
of the test and if the meter was found to be over-registering by more than 2%,
the testing fee shall be returned along with a refund for up to 12 months or
the actual length of time the meter was installed, whichever is shorter. The
refund shall be the amount overcharged during the time as determined by
recalculation of the past bills for said period.

term or provision of this chapter to the contrary, the fees, expenses, costs
and charges for labor and materials to be paid by any applicant or customer for
any meter, tap, and installation of water or wastewater service or connection
shall never be less than the actual cost thereof as determined by the Director.

chapter or when such charges, costs, expenses or fees are inadequate, the
Director shall establish such charges and fees based on the actual cost of
materials and labor for performing the installation of the meter, tap,

The total monthly rate for a user shall be the sum of the fixed rate plus the
variable rate times the user’s water volume for the month.
 
   (C)   Due dates for payment of monthly water utility bills, late charges and
disconnection for delinquent payment or nonpayment.
      (1)   As nearly as reasonably practical, each customer shall be sent a
monthly water utility bill to the customer's address shown on the department's
records. Each water utility bill shall include but shall not be limited to the
applicable monthly base rate for water and water usage. Each water utility bill
shall be due and payable within 48 hours after the same is mailed by the
department or is delivered to the customer, whichever event shall first occur.
Payment of a water utility bill shall be made to the City of Ferris Water
Department, 104 S. Central, Ferris, Texas 75125.
      (2)   Any customer who fails to pay a water utility bill within 15 days
from the date such bill was invoiced shall be subject to a late payment penalty
in the amount of 10% of the total amount due. Payments must be in the office,
not postmarked, to avoid a late payment penalty.
      (3)   Any customer who fails to pay the water utility bill and/or any
other fee, penalty or charge imposed, levied and/or assessed under this chapter
within 20 days from the date such bill was invoiced shall be subject, without
notice from the city, to such customer's services being disconnected from the
city's water system. Failure to receive a bill or second notice will not
relieve the customer of the responsibility of timely payment of the account and
will not negate any fees or penalties due.
      (4)   Any customer which has been placed on disconnect list for non-
payment under this division (B) of this section shall pay all delinquent water
utility bills as may be required under § 50.002 of this chapter prior to
reconnection. Additionally, a service trip fee shall be charged for
reconnections made between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on normal city workdays, as
provided in the fee schedule. An increased trip service fee, as provided in the
fee schedule shall be charged for reconnections made between 5:00 p.m. and 10:
00 p.m. on normal city workdays or at such other times as may be approved by
the Director. No reconnections will be made after 10:00 p.m. or before 8:00
a.m. on normal workdays or at any other time unless approved by the Director.
      (5)   The owner of the premises serviced and customer in whose name the
account for services exists are jointly and severally liable for all charges
for monthly water utility bills, late payments and reconnection fees assessed,
levied or imposed under this chapter. Nevertheless, where service is provided
to a tenant or occupant in a structure, whether residential or commercial, or
to more than one tenant or occupant through a master meter or single service
connection, the other owners and occupants shall remain jointly and severally
liable for the unpaid delinquent amounts if the customer in whose name the
account exists fails, refuses or is unable to pay the amounts shown on a water
utility bill as the same became due and payable. The Director may refuse
service or discontinue service to all other tenants, occupants and/or customers
in said structure in the same manner provided for in this §
50.005 of this chapter until all delinquent amounts are fully paid.
      (6)   Where a person, business or entity which is liable for any
delinquent amounts at one address is found to have an account in his or its
name at another address, the delinquent amounts at the previous address may be
transferred to the account at the new address, and service discontinued at the
new address until the delinquent amounts are fully paid.
      (7)   Miscellaneous charges and provisions.
         (a)   Requested disconnect fee. The service charge for a department
employee answering the request of a customer for a temporary disconnection of
service shall be charged, as provided in the Fee Schedule, per trip and shall
be paid by such customer upon demand.
         (b)   Return check fee. Upon the return of any check issued by a
customer and is not paid or is returned by the bank on which it is drawn for
any reason, a fee shall be assessed for such returned check and shall be paid
by the customer who issued such check, as provided in the fee schedule. Upon
notice that the customer's check did not clear the bank, the account will be
treated as though no payment was made.
         (c)   Delinquent fee. Once the department clerk has generated a list
of delinquent accounts, a delinquent fee will be charged, as provided in the
fee schedule. Reconnect fees will automatically be applied once the disconnect
list has been generated, even if the water service has not yet been
disconnected.
         (d)   Adjustment for leaks. Any customer who requests an adjustment
due to a water leak shall present to the Director such documents and
verification as the Director may require to substantiate that a water leak has
occurred. If the Director is satisfied that a leak has occurred, the Director
may adjust one month's billing to that customer during the period of the leak
to an amount equal to the full applicable base and usage rate for the first
10,000 gallons of water or the average usage for the previous two months,
whichever is greater and to charge a reduced amount, as provided in the fee
schedule, per thousand gallons over that amount for that month. The customer
shall not be entitled to any further adjustments for that leak even though said
leak may have extended into two or more monthly billing periods. The customer
shall not be entitled to any further leak adjustments for six months after
receiving a leak adjustment.

or reestablished.
      (7)   There is unduly restricted entry so that inspections for cross-
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency to assure that cross-
connections do not exist.
      (8)   Materials are being used such that, if backflow should occur, a
health hazard could result.
      (9)   Installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly is deemed
to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of these regulations in the judgment
of the city.

be required.
      (17)   All multistory buildings or any building with a booster pump or
elevated storage tank.
      (18)   Retrofitting will be required on all high hazard connections and
wherever else the city deems necessary to retrofit.
   (B)   All backflow prevention assemblies installed after the effective date
of this subchapter shall be installed in a manner designed to facilitate ease
of inspection by the regulatory authority of the city or his chosen
representative. Any currently installed backflow prevention assemblies which,
in the opinion of the regulatory authority, are located in inaccessible
locations, or where the tester is subject to physical danger shall be relocated
to an approved location.
(Ord. O-16-821, passed 7-28-2016)
§ 50.020 TESTING OF ASSEMBLIES.
   (A)   The regulatory authority shall require inspection and testing of all
assemblies in each of the following circumstances:
      (1)   Immediately after installations;
      (2)   Whenever the assembly is moved;
      (3)   A minimum of once a year;
      (4)   Premises that have been vacated and unoccupied for one year, prior

      (1)   DCs must be sized to provide an adequate supply of waste and
pressure for the premises being served. Consult manufacturer’s specifications
for specific performance data.
      (2)   Premises where an uninterrupted water supply is critical should be
provided two assemblies installed in parallel. Assemblies should be sized in
such a manner that either assembly will provide the minimum waste requirements
while the two together will provide the maximum flow required.
      (3)   The assembly shall be readily accessible with adequate room for
testing and maintenance. DCs may be installed below grade, providing all test
cocks are fitted with brass pipe plugs. All vaults shall be well drained,
constructed of suitable materials, and sized to allow for the minimum
clearances established below.
      (4)   Assemblies two inches and smaller shall have at least six-inch
clearance below and on both sides of the assembly, and if located in a vault,
the bottom of the assembly shall be not more than 24 inches below grade. All
assemblies larger than two inches shall have a minimum clearance of 12 inches
on the back side. 24 inches on the test cock side, and 12 inches below the
assembly. Headroom of six feet or 72 inches is required in vaults without a
fully removable top. A minimum access opening of 36 inches is required on all
vault lids. “Y” pattern double check valve assemblies shall be installed so

that causes the city's pro rata share of the total BOD or TSS loading to the
POTW system to exceed the city's pro rata share of the total flow to the POTW
system. (Example: if the city contributes 25% of the total wastewater flow to
the system, the city's cumulative BOD or TSS loading to the system, as measured
at the city's points of entry to the system, shall not exceed 25% of the total
BOD or TSS loading to the system.)
   (B)   Any industry with a wastewater strength that will cause the city's
cumulative wastewater loading, at the city's points of entry, to exceed the
city's pro rata share of the total wastewater loading based upon flow, shall be
required to install pretreatment facilities to reduce its wastewater strength
to an acceptable level.

§ 51.073 HAZARDOUS WASTE DISCHARGE; NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. § 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under §
51.069. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
51.065,
51.067, and
51.068.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Director,
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of that substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. § 136, and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 C.F.R. § 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical
methods or any applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the Director, the EPA, TCEQ, or other parties approved
by EPA.

§ 51.075 SAMPLE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES.
   (A)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) of this section, the user
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
51.065 and
51.067 (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data does not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by §
51.068 (40 C.F.R. §§ 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 51.099 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   The Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow
the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless
the termination proceedings in §
51.100 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under §§
51.096 or
51.100.

51.050, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
51.015 to
51.020.
   (B)   Such users will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
51.096 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

§
51.999
§ 51.101 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction through the City Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary restraining order and temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Director may also seek such other action
as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement
for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.
(Ord. 317, passed 10-16-1995; Am. Ord. O-21-932, passed 3-1-2021) Penalty, see
§
51.999
§ 51.102 REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Director
may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the Director may take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Director
is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user.
(Ord. 317, passed 10-16-1995; Am. Ord. O-21-932, passed 3-1-2021) Penalty, see
§
51.999
§ 51.103 APPLICABILITY OF MORE STRINGENT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   More stringent discharge limits. If national pretreatment standards,
categorical or otherwise, more stringent than the discharge limits prescribed
in this article are promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency for certain industries, the more stringent national pretreatment
standards will apply to the affected industrial user. A violation of the more
stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation
of this chapter.
   (B)   Applicability of more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user
within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated
by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a
reciprocal agreement with the city is subject to the following additional
rules:
      (1)   If the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than
those prescribed by this chapter, or by a discharge permit issued hereunder,
because the United States Environmental Protection Agency requires the more
stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entity's wastewater
pretreatment program, the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail.
      (2)   The Director is authorized to issue a discharge permit to an
industrial user affected by division (1) to ensure notice of and compliance
with the more stringent discharge limits. If the industrial user already has a
discharge permit, the Director may amend the permit to apply and enforce the
more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user shall submit to the
Director an expected compliance date and an installation schedule if the more
stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments
to discharge facilities or plant processes.
      (3)   If the Director chooses not to issue or amend a permit under
division (2), the Director shall notify the affected industrial user in writing
of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date. Regardless of
whether or not a permit is issued or amended, an industrial user shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent discharge limits.
      (4)   The more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon termination
of the city's wholesale wastewater contract or reciprocal agreement with the
governmental entity, or upon modification or elimination of the limits by the
government entity or the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The
Director shall take the appropriate action to notify the affected industrial
user of an occurrence under this division (4).
   (C)   Variances in compliance dates. The Director may grant a variance in
compliance dates to an industry when, in the Director's opinion, such action is
necessary to achieve pretreatment or corrective measures. In no case shall the
Director grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry affected by
national categorical pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates
established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
   (D)   Authority to regulate. The Director may establish regulations, not in
conflict with this chapter or other laws, to control the disposal and discharge
of industrial waste into the wastewater system and to ensure compliance with
the city's pretreatment enforcement program with all applicable pretreatment
regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
The regulations established shall, where applicable, be made part of any
discharge permit issued to an industrial user by the Director.

§
51.999
§ 51.104 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Act of God provision.
      (1)   An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely
by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe is not a violation.
      (2)   In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have
the burden of proof.
      (3)   In the event that an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other
catastrophe has been established, the user shall control production of all
discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction, loss, or
failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of
treatment is provided.
   (B)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of
a user's treatment facility.
         SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (B)(3) and (4) below.
      (3)   Bypass notifications.
         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Director at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-
by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   Bypass.
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (B)(3)
above.
         (b)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet
the three conditions listed in division (B)(4)(a) above.

51.999
§ 51.105 PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES; SURCHARGES.
   (A)   The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of
setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program, which may include:
      (1)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the
cost of processing the applications;
      (2)   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
      (3)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;
      (4)   Fees for filing appeals;
      (5)   Recovery of administrative and legal costs associated with
enforcement activity taken by the Director to address industrial user
noncompliance.
      (6)   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered
by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties
chargeable by the city;
      (7)   Fees for treating abnormal strength wastes; and
      (8)   Fees incurred from an upset, bypass, or unauthorized discharge.
   (B)   Surcharge. The city may surcharge industrial users for the treatment
of abnormal strength wastes. Water or wastes having (1) a five-day biochemical
oxygen demand greater than 250 parts per million (ppm) by weight, or (2)
containing more than 250 parts per million by weight of total suspended solids,
shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director. Where the Director
has approved the admission of (1) and/or (2) above into the POTW, that
discharge may be subject to a surcharge as determined by the Director. In no
case shall a discharge be accepted that will prevent the POTW from meeting its
NPDES or TPDES limits.
      (1)   The surcharge will be assessed according to the following formula
each month using the most current pollutant concentration data and the current
month's wastewater flow:
         Surcharge = [Q/1,000,000]* [a(BOD - x) + b(TSS - y)] [8.34]
         Where:
         Q = flow in gallons
         8.34 = weight in pounds of one gallon of water
         x = normal limits of BOD in domestic wastewater expressed in
milligrams per liter
         y = normal limits of TSS in domestic wastewater expressed in
milligrams per liter
         a = unit cost of treatment per pound of BOD
         b = unit cost of treatment per pound of TSS
      (2)   A surcharge is an additional charge by the POTW for the increased
cost of handling discharge of unusual strength and character and shall not
serve as a variance to the requirements of this chapter. Exercise of this
provision shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
(Ord. 317, passed 10-16-1995; Am. Ord. O-21-932, passed 3-1-2021)
§ 51.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the city for a
maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   A user who violates intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or
negligently any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not
more than $2,000 per violation, per day.
      (2)   A user who intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently
introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property
damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to the
same penalties described in division (B)(1). This penalty shall be in addition
to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available
under state law.
      (3)   A user who makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be subject to the same penalties described
in division (B)(1).
      (4)   Criminal responsibility. A person is criminally responsible for a
violation of this chapter if that person intentionally, knowingly, recklessly,
or negligently:
         (a)   Commits or assists in the commission of a violation, or causes
or permits another person to commit a violation, of this chapter; or
         (b)   Owns or manages the property or facilities determined to be the
cause of the illegal discharge under §§
51.015,
51.016,
51.017,
51.026, or

be in the form of a manifest. The manifest shall include:
         (a)   Name, address, telephone, and commission registration number of
transporter;
         (b)   Name, signature, address, and phone number of the person who
generated the waste and the date collected;
         (c)   Type and amount(s) of waste collected or transported;
         (d)   Name and signature(s) of responsible person(s) collecting,
transporting, and depositing the waste;
         (e)   Date and place where the waste was deposited;
         (f)   Identification (permit or site registration number, location,
and operator) of the facility where the waste was deposited;
         (g)   Name and signature of facility on-site representative
acknowledging receipt of the waste and the amount of waste received;
         (h)   The volume of the grease waste received; and
         (i)   A consecutive numerical tracking number to assist transporters,
waste generators, and regulating authorities in tracking the volume of grease
transported.
      (3)   Manifests shall be divided into five parts and records shall be
maintained as follows.
         (a)   One part of the manifest shall have the generator and
transporter information completed and be given to the generator at the time of
waste pickup.
         (b)   The remaining four parts of the manifest shall have all required
information completely filled out and signed by the appropriate party before
distribution of the manifest.
         (c)   One part of the manifest shall go to the receiving facility.

all manifests showing the collection and disposition of waste.
         (e)   One copy of the manifest shall be returned by the transporter to
the person who generated the wastes within 15 days after the waste is received
at the disposal or processing facility.
         (f)   One part of the manifest shall go to the local authority.
      (4)   Copies of manifests returned to the waste generator shall be
retained for five years and be readily available for review by the POTW.
   (F)   Alternative treatment.
      (1)   A person commits an offense if the person introduces, or causes,
permits, or suffers the introduction of any surfactant, solvent or emulsifier
into a grease trap. Surfactants, solvents, and emulsifiers are materials which
allow the grease to pass from the trap into the collection system, and include
but are not limited to enzymes, soap, diesel, kerosene, terpene, and other
solvents.
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to an enforcement of division (F)(1)
that the use of surfactants or soaps is incidental to normal kitchen hygiene
operations.
      (3)   Bioremediation media may be used with the POTW's approval if the
person has proved to the satisfaction of the POTW that laboratory testing which
is appropriate for the type of grease trap to be used has verified that:
         (a)   The media is a pure live bacterial product which is not
inactivated by the use of domestic or commercial disinfectants and detergents,
strong alkalis, acids, and/or water temperatures of 160°F (71°C).
         (b)   The use of the media does not reduce the buoyancy of the grease
layer in the grease trap and does not increase the potential for oil and grease
to be discharged to the sanitary sewer.
         (c)   The use of the bioremediation media does not cause foaming in
the sanitary sewer.
         (d)   The BOD, COD, and TSS discharged to the sanitary sewer after use
of the media does not exceed the BOD, COD, and TSS which would be discharged if
the product were not being used and the grease trap was being properly
maintained. PH levels must be between five and 11.
      (4)   All testing designed to satisfy the criteria set forth in division
(F)(3) shall be scientifically sound and statistically valid. All tests to
determine oil and grease, TSS, BOD, COD, pH, and other pollutant levels shall
use appropriate tests which have been approved by the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and which are defined
in Title 40, C.F.R., Part 136 or Tex. Admin. Code Title 30 § 319.11. Testing
shall be open to inspection by the POTW and shall meet the POTW's approval.
(Ord. O-24-991, passed 1-18-2024)
§ 53.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   If the POTW determines that a generator is responsible for a blockage
of a collection system line the generator shall owe a civil penalty of $1,000
for the first violation, $1,500 for a second violation, and $2,000 for the
third violation within a two-year period. Continuous violations shall result in
an increase in penalty by $500 and may also result in termination of services.
   (B)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a written warning for the first violation, a $1,000 civil penalty
for the second violation, a $1,500 civil penalty for the third violation, and a
$2,000 civil penalty for the fourth violation within a two-year period.
Consistent violations will result in a $500 increase in civil penalty and may
result in termination of service.

In the alternative, these stalls or spaces may be designated by a readily
visible symbol or insignia consisting of a profile view of a wheelchair with
the occupant in any color painted or inscribed in the pavement of the stall or

§ 71.02 LARGE OR HEAVY VEHICLES; PARKING RESTRICTED.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the operator or owner of any motor vehicle
weighing over 1 ton to stop, stand, or park that vehicle on any street adjacent
to or in front of any residence in the city; provided, however, that operators
of commercial vehicles engaged in making deliveries may park those vehicles on
the residential streets in the city while loading and unloading same.
   (B)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to Ferris Independent
School District buses, emergency vehicles, motor homes, recreational motor
homes, private passenger automobiles, or to motor vehicles and other equipment
which are actually engaged in work upon any residential street or while engaged
in installing or repairing utilities.
(Ord. 183, passed 12-3-1984) Penalty, see §
71.99
§ 71.03 TIME, PLACE AND MANNER OF PARKING VEHICLES.
   (A)   No vehicles shall be authorized to drive or park on any unimproved
surfaces in any city park facility, other than vehicles used for care and
maintenance of the facility or fire and police vehicles performing official
acts; or vehicles utilized in the performance of an official function open to
the public.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any regulation, sign,
signal or other device for controlling parking or traffic which has been
established by the city.
   (C)   No person, firm or corporation shall obstruct a street or sidewalk, or
the space vertically above the same, by placing therein anything whatsoever
which will hinder or obstruct the passage of persons or vehicles in any manner
whatsoever. Every hour the violation continues may, in the discretion of the
judge of the city's municipal court, be held to be a separate offense. This
section shall, however, be subject to the following limitations and exceptions:
      (1)   Public utility companies may place such reasonable number of poles
as may be requisite for their business, but such poles shall be located or
moved according to the directions and under the supervision of the director of
public works.
      (2)   Merchants and others, while receiving goods or articles, may place
the same on the outer margin of the sidewalk, using as much thereof as may be
necessary and no more, if the public is not deprived thereby of the free, easy
and comfortable use of the sidewalk. Such occupation of the sidewalk shall be
for only such time as may be necessary for such reception or delivery. It shall
be the duty of the police to see that the sidewalks are not so obstructed as to
deprive the public of the use thereof as hereinbefore described. Police
officers may require goods and other articles which, in their opinion, obstruct
the sidewalk, to be moved at once. Vehicles in violation of this ordinance are
subject to being towed. The registered owner of towed vehicles will be
responsible for all towing/impound fees.
      (3)   Police, fire and ambulance or other emergency vehicles in the
performance of an official function or duty.
      (4)   Barriers and lights to warn against danger from work on abutting
property.
      (5)   When any work is being done on structures abutting on any street or
sidewalk which may endanger persons passing along such street or sidewalk,
barriers shall be placed across the way so as to prevent and warn persons
against the danger. No bricks, slate or any other thing or substance shall be
thrown off, from or out of such structure or any part thereof into the street
or sidewalk, except within the space enclosed by such barriers. When any ditch
is dug or excavation is made in or abutting a street or sidewalk, sufficient
barriers shall be placed around and over the same to prevent persons from
falling therein. During the nighttime while such excavation or opening is
uncovered or unenclosed, sufficient lanterns or other noticeable lights shall
be conspicuously placed so as to warn persons of such excavation or opening. In
addition to any penalty imposed for a violation of this section, the person
failing to comply with the provisions of this section shall be responsible for
all damages resulting therefrom.
      (6)   Restricted use of city streets. No activity conducted by any person
in or upon any city streets or rights-of-way shall be located where such
activity:
         (a)   Would block access to the entrance to any adjacent building or
driveway;
         (b)   Would occupy more than half of the available sidewalk width;
         (c)   Is within ten feet of a fire hydrant, public telephone, fire
escape, hospital, bus stop, loading zone, or the driveway of a police or fire
station;
         (d)   Is within the portion of any street intended for the use of
motor vehicles, unless a permit has been obtained from the city.
         (e)   Is within lanes reserved for use by fire and emergency vehicles,
unless a permit has been obtained from the city and approved by the Fire Chief
and Police Chief.
         (f)   Is within an area reserved to another person by a permit for a
special event or community event, unless with the permission of the person to
whom the permit has been issued.
      (7)   Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of
this ordinance or the provisions of the code of ordinances of the city, as
amended hereby, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction in
the municipal court of the city, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed the
sum of $200 for each offense.

   (A)   General. Any person who violates a provision of this chapter for which
no other penalty is provided shall be subject to penalties as provided in §
70.99 of this code.

spaces or areas as in §
71.01 described and declared to be unlawful, shall be penalized as provided in
Tex. Trans. Code, §§ 502.253, 681.001 - 681.007, and 681.009 - 681.011.
(Ord. 274, passed 1-21-1992)
   (C)   Heavy vehicles in residential areas. Any person, business, or
corporation violating any provision of §
71.02 of this code shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined in any
sum as set by City Council ordinance, and each violation shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense.
(Ord. 183, passed 12-3-1984)

   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing
practice or who believes that he or she will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereinafter referred to
as the “charging party”) may file a complaint with the Mayor. These complaints
shall be in writing and shall identify the person alleged to have committed or
alleged to be committing a discriminatory housing practice and shall state the
facts upon which the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are
based. The Mayor shall prepare complaint forms and furnish them without charge
to any person, upon request.
   (B)   The Mayor shall receipt and accept notification and referral
complaints from the U.S. Attorney General and the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development pursuant to the provisions of Title VIII, Fair Housing Act of
1968, Pub. L. No. 90-284, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., and shall treat
those complaints hereunder in the same manner as complaints filed pursuant to
division (A) of this section.
   (C)   All complaints shall be filed within 180 days following the occurrence
of an alleged discriminatory housing practice. Upon the filing or referral of
any complaint, the Mayor shall provide notice of the complaint by furnishing a
copy of the complaint to the person named therein (hereinafter referred to as

alleged discriminatory housing practice. The respondent may file an answer to
the complaint within 15 days of receipt of the written complaint.
   (D)   All complaints and answers shall be subscribed and sworn to before an
officer authorized to administer oaths.
   (E)   If at any time the Mayor shall receive or discover credible evidence
and shall have probable cause to believe that any person or persons have
committed a discriminatory housing practice as to which no complaint has been
filed or is about to be filed, the Mayor may prepare and file a complaint upon
his or her own motion and in his or her own name, and that complaint shall
thereafter be treated in the same manner as a complaint filed by a person
aggrieved.
(Ord. 330, passed 12-2-1996)
§ 90.33 INVESTIGATION AND CONCILIATION.
   (A)   Upon the filing or referral of a complaint as herein provided, the
Mayor shall cause to be made a prompt and full investigation of the matter
stated in the complaint; provided, however, that before any charge becomes
accepted for investigative purposes, the Mayor or an investigator shall have
personally reviewed with the charging party the allegations contained therein
and shall have determined that the charge comes within the provisions of this
chapter. In the event the review results in the determination that a particular
charge does not come within the provisions of this chapter, the charging party
shall be given a clear and concise explanation of the reasons why it does not.
   (B)   If the Mayor determines that there is not probable cause to believe
that a particular alleged discriminatory housing practice has been committed,
the Mayor shall take no further action with respect to that alleged offense.
   (C)   During or after the investigation, but subsequent to the mailing of
the notice of complaint, the Mayor shall, if it appears that a discriminatory
housing practice has occurred or is threatening to occur, attempt by informal
endeavors to effect conciliation, including voluntary discontinuance of the
discriminatory housing practice, and to obtain adequate assurance of future
voluntary compliance with provisions of this chapter. Nothing said or done in
the course of those informal endeavors may be made public by the Mayor, the
City Council, the investigator, the conciliator, the charging party, or the
respondent, or be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the
written consent of all persons concerned.
   (D)   Upon completion of an investigation where the Mayor has made a
determination that a discriminatory housing practice has in fact occurred, if
the Mayor is unable to secure from the respondent an acceptable conciliation
agreement, then the City Council must, upon a majority vote, refer the case to
the City Attorney for prosecution in Municipal Court or to other agencies as
appropriate. With this recommendation of the Mayor and the referral of the City
Council, the Mayor shall refer his or her entire file to the City Attorney. The
City Attorney shall, after this referral, make a determination as to whether to
proceed with prosecution of the complaint in Municipal Court.
(Ord. 330, passed 12-2-1996)

within the City of Ferris.
      (2)   Overview. This section is designed to regulate noise by various
alternative means in order to allow the enforcement of noise regulations at
times when and by persons for whom noise meters are not available. A noise may
be in violation of this section because it is disturbing to a reasonable person
of ordinary sensibilities or because it exceeds the decibel level restrictions
provided below. If a noise violates more than one of these provisions, the
violation will be enforced under whichever provision is most applicable to the
situation as determined by the enforcement officer of the city.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      AMBIENT NOISE. The all-encompassing noise level associated with a given
environment, being a composite of sounds from all sources at the location,
constituting the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given
location.
      A-WEIGHTING (dBA). The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a
sound level meter using the A-weighted network. The level so read is designated
dB(A) or dBA.
      BOUNDING REAL PROPERTY LINE. An imaginary line at the ground and its
vertical extension which separates the real property owned or occupied by one
person from that owned or occupied by another person.
      DECIBEL (dBA). The unit of measurement for sound pressure at a specified
location.
      GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION. Work conducted by a governmental entity in the
interest of the community.

         (a)   Any unreasonably loud, disturbing, and unnecessary noise which
causes material distress, discomfort or injury to persons of ordinary
sensibilities in the immediate vicinity thereof: or
         (b)   Any noise of such character, intensity and continued duration,
which substantially interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of private homes
by persons of ordinary sensibilities.
   (C)   Restrictions on decibel levels.
      (1)   Maximum sound levels. During the times and in the zoning districts
(except for activities originating in industrial zoning districts) set out
below, the activities that create a sound pressure level on the complainant’s
bounding real property line that exceeds the maximum allowable sound level
(dBA) below are declared to be public nuisances:
         (a)   All residential zoning districts:
            Daytime: 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.   = 70 dBA

      (2)   Method of noise measurement. Noise measurements shall be a minimum
of 30 seconds in duration. Decibel levels are measured from the complainant’s
property line. For residential districts adjacent to other districts (excluding
industrial zoning districts) the residential decibel levels apply when measured
from a residential complainant’s property line. Violations will be determined
based on the highest registered reading in that measurement period. All
measurement levels will be inclusive of any ambient noise that exists at the
time of the measurement.
   (D)   Noise prohibited.
      (1)   In addition to the other noise restrictions in this section, no

(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.02 CONSTRUCTION; GOVERNING LAW; VENUE.
   This chapter shall be construed under and in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas and the city charter and this code to the extent that such
charter and code are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution
and laws of the United States or the State of Texas. All obligations of the
parties hereunder are performable in Ellis County and/or Dallas County, Texas.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.03 SCOPE.
   This chapter shall be effective within the geographical limits of the city,
including any areas subsequently annexed by the city.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.04 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES; APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Purpose. This chapter provides principles and procedures for the
placement of structures and facilities, construction, excavation,
encroachments, and work activities within or upon any public right-of-way and
to protect the integrity of the road and city utility system. To achieve these
purposes, it is necessary to require permits of private users of the public
rights-of-way, except as prohibited by law, and to establish permit procedures,
rules, and regulations for work done within or upon the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Objectives. Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for
location of facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in
the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the city must
ensure that the primary purpose of the rights-of-way, safe passage of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent
possible. In addition, the value of other public and private installations,
roadways, the city utility system, facilities, and properties should be
protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved.
The use of the public rights-of-way by persons, agencies, network providers,
and public infrastructure contractors is secondary to these public objectives
and the movement of traffic. This chapter is intended to strike a balance
between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use
of public rights-of-way for location of facilities by public and private
entities. The chapter thus has several objectives:
      (1)   To ensure that the public safety is maintained, and that public
inconvenience is minimized.
      (2)   To protect the city's infrastructure investment by establishing
repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public
rights-of-way when work is accomplished.
      (3)   To facilitate work within the public rights-of-way through the
standardization of regulations.
      (4)   To maintain an efficient permit process.
      (5)   To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of
the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the city.
      (6)   To establish a public policy for enabling the city to discharge its
public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory
policies, industry competition, and technological development.
      (7)   To promote cooperation among the agencies, network providers, and
public infrastructure contractors (as defined herein) and the city in the
occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to:
         (a)   Eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly;
         (b)   Lower the agencies', network providers', public infrastructure
contractors' and the city's costs of providing services to the public; and
         (c)   Preserve the physical integrity of the streets and highways by
minimizing street cuts.
      (8)   To assure that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly
protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (9)   To further the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the city by establishing aesthetic standards for installation of facilities
in the public right-of-way that are reasonable, are technically feasible, and
are reasonably directed to avoiding or remedying the intangible public harm of
unsightly or out-of-character deployments.
   (C)   Applicability.
      (1)   The requirements of this chapter apply to all persons, agencies,
network providers, and public infrastructure contractors that place structures
and facilities or that conduct construction, excavation, encroachments, and
work activities within or upon any public rights-of-way except:
         (a)   Persons, agencies, or public infrastructure contractors
providing service drops for single-family and two-family residence-zoned
properties on private property. All permits for these properties will be issued
through the city's building inspection department.
         (b)   New residential service connections which are permitted through
the building inspection department of the city.
         (c)   Right-of-way use for valet-parking.
         (d)   Right-of-way use for sidewalk cafes.
         (e)   Revocable use of the right-of-way pursuant to an encroachment
agreement.
      (2)   Any permit issued prior to July 17, 2023 will remain subject to the
terms and conditions of city ordinances and requirements in effect at the time
of issuance of the permit and is not affected by this chapter, except that,
upon expiration or conclusion of the permit, a new or renewal permit must be
obtained in accordance with this chapter.

be required in order for the proposed installation to be made and completed.
For all applications for the installation or construction of wireless
facilities, including network nodes and node support poles, if any such
additional authorizations are required, the applicant is responsible for
providing all the information necessary for the city to review and act on the
additional authorizations. Such additional authorizations that must be included
with the application shall include, but not be limited to, executed agreement
(s) with the city for attachment to service poles.
         (g)   Completeness. The application is not complete unless it contains
all information required by this chapter, requested on the application form,
and required by any supplemental list of required documentation provided by the
city with the application form.
      (2)   No person, agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor shall install facilities or otherwise encroach upon the right-of-way
or make a pavement cut or excavate in a public right-of-way without first
obtaining a permit from the engineering department, except in an emergency.
      (3)   If the project lies within a Texas Department of Transportation,
NTTA or any other agency's right-of-way, the applicant must provide evidence of
a permit from the state or federal government, or other appropriate agency at
the time of application.
      (4)   Franchised agencies and agencies that are certificated
telecommunications providers have prior authorization to do work in public
rights-of-way. However, an agency's use of the public rights-of-way is subject
to and must occur in accordance with State of Texas laws, federal laws, and
city ordinances, policies, standards and procedures. Said use is non-exclusive
and does not establish priority for use over other franchise holders, permit
holders, or the city. A permit issued by the city is required for all work done
in the public rights-of-way.
      (5)   New residential service connections do not require a permit under
this chapter. However, a building permit may be required from the building
inspections department. An agency or public infrastructure contractor must
inquire with the building inspections department as to whether a permit is
required for such service connections. Maintenance or replacement of existing
service connections that requires excavation will require a permit under this
chapter.
      (6)   The city shall state on the permit the activity for which the
permit is issued and any additional restrictions or requirements that have been
placed upon the permit besides those incorporated into the permit by this
chapter, the zoning ordinance, or other law or regulation, as applicable.
      (7)   All construction and installation in the public rights-of-way shall
be in accordance with the permit issued for the facilities. The City Engineer
shall be provided access to the work and to such further information as he or
she may reasonably require to ensure compliance with the permit.

engineering plans shall be maintained at the construction site and made
available for inspection by the City Engineer at all times when construction or
installation work is occurring.
      (9)   The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor
shall update any new information on permit applications within ten business
days after any change occurs.
      (10)   Agencies, network providers, or public infrastructure contractors
may apply jointly for permits to work in public rights-of-way at the same time
and place.
      (11)   All permit holders must contact the Building Permits and
Inspections Department by email Permits@FerrisTexas.gov at least 48 hours
before work begins under the permit.
      (12)   If no work has begun on a network node permit within 180 days of
final approval of the permit, or within 30 calendar days of final approval for
a standard right-of-way permit, the permit shall be void, and a new permit
shall be required.
      (13)   A 60-day extension to a permit may be granted if requested by the
agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor in writing via
email to the Building Permits and Inspections Department. Such a request must
be made before the permit expires. If no call for the cancellation of a permit,
or for an inspection after completion of the work, is received within the 60-
day extension period, the permit shall be void, and a new permit shall be
required.
   (B)   Types of permits.
      (1)   Standard right-of-way permits.
            (a)   A standard right-of-way permit is required whenever a cut or
excavation is made in a public right-of-way by an agency or public
infrastructure contractor.
            (b)   Application for a standard right-of-way permit shall be made
no less than two city business days prior to the date of the proposed activity.
If the proposed cut or excavation is to be made in the public rights-of-way
dedicated to the State of Texas, a city permit is required in addition to any
and all permits required by the state or other agencies.
            (c)   A city permit is required although specific authority has
been granted by the engineering department to cut a paved street, curb or alley
as a part of a new construction project.
            (d)   An annual fee for use of the right-of-way and a contract with
the city is required. Where such fees are not otherwise determined by franchise
or prohibited by state or federal law:
               1.   Fee per linear foot: $1.50.
               2.   Fee per street crossing: $1,000.
            (e)   Late fees may be assessed as allowed by law.
            (f)   The contract shall determine any inflator for the annual fee,
and if the contract expires, the rate in effect on the date of expiry shall be
the initial rate for any additional contract terms.
      (2)   Permits issued under emergency conditions. Any agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor maintaining facilities in the
public rights-of-way may proceed with repairs upon existing facilities without
a permit when emergency circumstances demand that the work be done immediately.
The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor doing the
work shall notify the engineering department no later than the next business
day by telephone or e-mail when an emergency permit is required. A permit
application for the proper permit under this section must be submitted and the

providers. The permit may be for transport facilities, network nodes, or
network node support poles.
         (b)   Fees per application for network nodes, transportation
facilities, and poles are the maximum allowed by Tex. Local Govt. Code Ch. 284
or the order, whichever is lower, as further amended.
         (c)   A small cell maintenance permit is required for any activity in
the right- of-way unless an exception in §
96.08(B)(2) applies. A small cell maintenance permit is subject to the same
fees, requirements and timeframes as a small cell right-of-way permit.
         (d)   Transport services. Network providers may obtain transport
service from a person or entity that is paying city fees to occupy the public
right-of-way that are equivalent to transport fees stated in §
96.15(B). If third-party transport services are used, the network provider must
identify the third-party provider, and provide documentation, at the time of
filing the application, that the third-party
transport service provider is paying city fees and that the network provider
has received written permission to use such transport services for the specific
address.
         (e)   Collocation on a service pole. An applicant proposing

and monthly fees for wireless facilities under §
96.15(A), the city will assume installation of the facilities six months from
the date the permit is approved.
         (g)   Application completeness; timeframe. Not later than the tenth
day after the date of receipt of an application for a permit for a transport
facility, network node or node support pole, the city shall determine whether
the application is materially complete and notify the applicant of that
determination. If the city determines that the application is incomplete, the
city shall specifically identify the missing information in the notification to
the applicant, with reference to the specific rule or regulation requiring the
information.
         (h)   Approval or denial of application; timeframe. Unless the time
periods herein are tolled or extended by written agreement between the city and
the applicant, the city will approve or deny applications according to the
following:
            1.   For applications for one or more new node support poles, no
later than the ninetieth day after the date of receipt of a materially complete
application;
            2.   For applications for one or more network nodes on existing
poles or structures, no later than the sixtieth day after the date of receipt

denies the application.
         (k)   Cure after denial. Not later than the thirtieth day after the
date the city denies the application, the applicant may cure the deficiencies
identified in the denial documentation and resubmit the application without
paying an additional application fee, other than a fee for actual costs
incurred by the city. Notwithstanding division (h), the city shall approve or
deny the revised completed application after a denial not later than the
ninetieth day after the date the city receives the completed revised
application. The city's review of the revised application is limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial application.
   (C)   Denial, suspension, or revocation of a permit.
      (1)   Denial of a permit. A permit may be denied for any one of the
following reasons:
         (a)   The proposed activity will substantially interfere with
vehicular or pedestrian traffic and no procedures, or procedures which are
inconsistent with this chapter, have been implemented to minimize the
interference.
         (b)   The proposed construction will substantially interfere with
another activity for which a permit has been issued or will conflict or

the City Engineer, failure to comply with the restrictions or requirements
placed upon the permit by the City Engineer, a violation of this chapter, or
for public health, safety or welfare reasons may be reinstated by the City
Engineer if the City Engineer determines that:
         (a)   The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor has corrected the violation, noncompliance, or hazard that caused
the revocation or denial; and
         (b)   The health, safety and welfare of the public is not jeopardized
by reinstating or issuing the permit.
      (5)   An agency or public infrastructure contractor may appeal a permit
denial, suspension, or revocation in accordance with the provisions of §
96.11.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.10 FACILITY SIZE AND LOCATIONS.
   These provisions apply to all facilities, including those of franchise
utilities, unless specifically contradicted in the franchise agreement.
   (A)   Location in right-of-way, generally. Facilities and related ground
equipment shall be placed within two-feet from the outer edge of the right-of-
way line and three-feet from back of curb to minimize any obstruction,
impediment, or hindrance to the usual travel or public safety on a public
right-of-way, unless on an existing pole.
   (B)   Location in right-of-way, new development. All facilities in new
developments shall be located in accordance with Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4, unless
an alternative location has been approved by the City Engineer. Such utility
locations are hereby adopted as standard locations for facilities in new
developments. The intent of these items is that they serve as a standard, not
only to agencies, network providers, and public infrastructure contractors
working under city permit, but also to all city agencies whose routine business
requires the installation, repair or relocation of utilities.
   (C)   Location in right-of-way, existing development. New facilities to be
installed in previously developed streets should be located as in Exhibits 1,
2, 3 and 4. If that location is already being used by another facility, the new
facility shall be located such that it does not interfere with other
facilities, both existing and future. No new facilities shall be located
longitudinally in a median or under existing or proposed pavement, unless
permitted by the City Engineer.
   (D)   New poles.
      (1)   Materials. Poles located in medians must be constructed of steel or
concrete, or other material approved by the City Engineer. Wood poles are
prohibited.
      (2)   Pole height. New poles or modified utility poles may not exceed the
lesser of:
         (a)   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole
located within 500 linear feet of the new pole in the same public right-of-way;
or
         (b)   Fifty feet above grade level for freeway signs.
      (3)   Pole spacing. In order to avoid congestion of right-of-way caused
by multiple pole installations, minimize the hazard of poles adjacent to
roadways, minimize the effect on property values, and to maintain the
aesthetics of the area by avoiding the negative impact on the public of
unsightly proliferation of poles in the right-of-way, poles shall be spaced as
provided herein. New poles, including new utility service poles, shall be
spaced apart from existing utility poles or node support poles at the same
distance as the spacing between utility poles in the immediate proximity, but
no less than at a minimum 150-feet from a utility pole or another node support
pole. New poles must be ten feet from a driveway, 12-feet from the dripline of
existing trees, 15-feet from a pedestrian ramp, 20-feet from a traffic signal
pole, and 18-inches from the paved area of a sidewalk. In non-residential
zoning districts, facilities shall be located between tenant spaces, storefront
bays or adjoining properties where their shared property lines intersect the
right-of-way. In residential zoning districts, facilities shall be located
where the shared property line between two residential parcels intersects the
right-of- way. Access by vehicles or pedestrians may not be blocked by poles.
   (E)   Attachments to city-owned service poles.
      (1)   In accordance with agreement. Installations on all service poles
are restricted to network providers and shall be in accordance with an
agreement. The Director of Public Works or designee may enter into these
agreements on behalf of the city.
      (2)   No electrical meters are allowed on service poles or screening
walls.
      (3)   Required industry-standard pole load analysis. For proposed
installations on service poles network provider shall complete and submit to
the city an industry-standard pole load analysis indicating that the service
pole to which the network node is to be attached will safely support the load.
      (4)   Height of attachments. All attachments on all service poles shall
be at least eight feet above grade. If a network node attachment projects
toward the street, for the safety and protection of the public and vehicular
traffic, the attachment shall be installed no less than 16-feet above grade.
      (5)   Installations on traffic signals. Installations on all traffic
signal structures must not interfere with the integrity of the facility in any
way that may compromise the safety of the public. Location on signal arms is
prohibited. Installation of network node facilities on any traffic signal
structures shall:
         (a)   Be encased in a conduit separate from the traffic light
electronics;
         (b)   Have an electric power connection separate from the traffic
signal structure; and
         (c)   Have an access point separate from the traffic signal structure.
      (6)   Installations on street signage. Installations on all street
signage structures must not interfere with the integrity of the facility in any
way that may compromise the safety of the public. Installation of network node
facilities on any street signage structure that has electronic equipment shall:
         (a)   Be encased in a conduit separate from any city signage
electronics;
         (b)   Have an electric power connection separate from the signage
structure; and
         (c)   Have an access point separate from the signage structure.
   (F)   Height of equipment mounted on poles. Pole-mounted facilities shall be
installed at least eight-feet above grade, and if a facility is projecting
toward the street, for the safety and protection of the public and vehicular
traffic, the attachment shall be installed no less than 16-feet above grade.
   (G)   Protrusion of equipment. Pole-mounted or structure-mounted facilities
shall not protrude from the outer circumference of the existing structure or
pole by more than two feet.
   (H)   Size of pole-mounted equipment. Pole-mounted enclosures may not be
taller than five feet. The following types of associated ancillary equipment
are not included in the calculation of equipment volume: electric meters,
concealment elements, telecommunications demarcation boxes, grounding
equipment, power transfer switches, cut-off switches and vertical cable runs
for the connection of power and other services.
   (I)   Antenna size. Each antenna that does not have exposed elements and is
attached to an existing structure or pole: must be located inside an enclosure
of not more than six cubic feet in volume; may not exceed a height of three
feet above the existing structure or poles or extend the height of the
structure on which it is mounted by more than 10% above the preexisting height;
and may not protrude from the outer circumference of the existing structure or
pole by more than two feet. If an antenna has exposed elements and is attached
to an existing structure or pole, the antenna and all of the antenna's exposed
elements: must fit within an imaginary enclosure of not more than six cubic
feet; may not exceed a height of three-feet above the existing structure or
pole or extend the height of the structure on which it is mounted by more than
10% above the preexisting height; and may not protrude from the outer
circumference of the existing structure or pole by more than two feet. Antennas
with exposed elements must be mounted flush with the pole near the top. The
cumulative size of other equipment associated with the equipment attached to an
existing structure or pole may not: be more than 28 cubic feet in volume.
   (J)   Limitation on equipment on poles. There shall be no more than one
network node on any one pole.
   (K)   Private pole owner permission. Network providers must have written
approval of the utility pole
owner for each specific pole address and location on such pole. Written
permission must be submitted with the application for a right-of-way permit.
   (L)   Electric code. All poles must meet National Electric Code clearance
standards. Equipment attached to a utility pole must be installed in accordance
with the National Electrical Safety Code, subject to applicable codes, and the
utility pole owner's construction standards.
   (M)   Existing telephone or electrical lines between existing utility poles.
Micro network nodes lashed on existing telephone or electrical lines between
existing utility poles and not placed on utility poles, node support poles or
service poles, are exempted from the requirements for submitting a right-of-way
application, obtaining a right-of-way permit, and payment of a right-of-way
access fee.
   (N)   Prohibition on overhead facilities and overhead transport facilities.
In order to protect, maintain, and promote the appearance and natural
surroundings in public parks and certain residential areas by avoiding the
negative impact on the public of unsightly proliferation of poles in the right-
of-way, facilities may not be installed overhead in a public right-of-way if
the public right-of-way is in a park or is adjacent to a street or thoroughfare
that is both Class E+ or smaller and is in an area zoned residential or
restricted to residential use by deed restrictions. All transport facilities
must be underground in the above-mentioned areas. Underground facilities are
required for standard permit holders along Type D or smaller thoroughfares.
   (O)   Underground construction and use of poles. As required by the
subdivision ordinance of the city, and the comprehensive zoning ordinance as it
relates to overlay districts, and when required by general ordinances, deed
restrictions, regulations or rules of the city or applicable state or federal
law, and in order to protect, maintain, and promote the appearance of areas
within the city that have been designated as underground areas, to promote and
protect the public health by avoiding the intangible public harm or unsightly
or out-of-character deployments, the agency's, network provider's, or public
infrastructure contractor's new facilities shall be placed underground at
agency's, network provider's, or public infrastructure contractor's expense.
Underground facilities must be buried at least two-feet below surface level.
Placing facilities underground does not preclude the use of otherwise
acceptable ground- mounted equipment appurtenant to underground facilities,
unless such ground-mounted equipment is otherwise prohibited. Related
equipment, such as pedestals, must be placed in accordance with the city's
applicable code requirements and rules, including all visibility easement
requirements. In areas where existing facilities are aerial, the agency,
network provider, or public infrastructure contractor may install aerial
facilities. If a location is designated by the city to be an underground
requirement area, then an agency's or network provider's permit for the
location of the facilities, at such location will be revoked 90 calendar days
after the designation, with removal of said facilities at such location within
90 calendar days of such designation, or as otherwise reasonably allowed by the
city for the transition of other overhead facilities. Placement of street-
related poles and facilities above grade in the right-of- way, including but
not limited to stop signs and street lights, does not preclude an area from
designation as an area requiring undergrounding and placement of facilities on
street-related poles in an area requiring undergrounding is prohibited.
   (P)   Ground equipment, parks and public art. For the safety of park
patrons, particularly small children, to preserve the investment made by the
community in parks and public art, to protect, maintain, and promote the
appearance and natural surroundings in public parks by avoiding the negative
impact on the public of out-of-character deployments, and to allow full lines-
of-sight near park property and public art, no ground equipment may be
installed in a right-of-way that is within a park, within 250-feet of the
boundary line of a park, or within 250-feet of public art.
   (Q)   Ground equipment, generally. Ground equipment shall be minimal and the
least intrusive. In order to minimize negative visual impact to the surrounding
area, and to enhance the safety requirements of line of sight of pedestrians,
particularly small children, the City Engineer may deny a request for a permit
for a proposed location of ground equipment where existing ground equipment
within 300-feet already occupies a footprint of 28 cubic feet or more to
minimize effect on property values and aesthetics on the area. Ground equipment
shall be of a neutral color, and use exterior building materials that are
compatible with surrounding structures, as determined by the Planning Director.
   (R)   Ground enclosure size. Ground-based enclosures for network nodes and
standard right- of-way permits, separate from the pole, may not be more than 28
cubic feet. For standard permit holders, ground-based enclosures shall be no
larger than six-feet wide, four-feet two-inches high by two-feet deep. Any
larger facilities must be placed on private property and comply with all
requirements of the city's building code and comprehensive zoning ordinance,
including receipt of a building permit prior to installation.
   (S)   Concealment and enclosure, generally. Facilities shall be concealed or
enclosed as much as reasonably possible in an equipment box, cabinet, or other
unit that may include ventilation openings. External cables and wires hanging
off a pole shall be sheathed or enclosed in a conduit, so that wires are
protected and not visible or visually minimized. Guy wires, anchors, pedestals,
boxes, and other above grade facilities shall not fully or partially encroach
within a sidewalk area, including a clear vertical clearance of seven and one-
half feet above the sidewalk.
   (T)   Preserve sight visibility and access. No above-ground facilities shall
be located closer than three feet from the back of street curbs or edge of
alley or within the sight visibility area. Accessibility to property may not be
compromised by above-ground facilities except during construction.
   (U)   Design and historic district criteria. Stealth or concealment of
facilities and poles shall be required by the city in design districts with
decorative poles, in historic districts, and within 300 feet of a historic site
or structure or historic landmark recognized by the city, state or federal
government. Applications for placement of facilities in a design district with
decorative poles or historic district must include proposed stealth or
concealment measures. Total enclosure of antennas and other facilities within a
pole may be required. The Planning Director will review and determine the
suitability of the proposed stealth or concealment measures as part of the
right-of-way permit review process. The Planning Director will also determine
conformance with the downtown heritage resource district design standards for
all properties within a heritage district and determine conformance with all
other applicable zoning requirements for all facilities in a design district
with decorative poles or historic district. Micro network nodes may not be
lashed on lines in a design district with decorative poles, a historic
district, a residential district with minor arterial streets or smaller, or an
area adjacent to a park.
      (1)   Design districts within the city are:
         (a)   Planned Development (PD) districts that overlay any of the
above-listed standard zoning districts; and
         (b)   Freestanding Planned Development (PD) districts that contain
decorative poles, as those districts may be amended.
      (2)   Historic districts within the city are:
         (a)   Old (Original) Town District (OTS); and
         (b)   Residential Historic Overlay District as such overlay/zoning may
be amended.
      (3)   Any structures or areas within both a design district and a
historic district must meet the requirements for both designations.
   (V)   Utility easements. Above-ground facilities and poles are prohibited in
a utility easement if such utility easement is not adjacent to and parallel
with a public way, except with the written permission of the underlying fee
owner. The city may rely upon county appraisal records to determine the
ownership of the fee interest in the property. Poles must be spaced 300-feet or
more from any existing pole. Applications for permit under §
96.09(B) must be accompanied by a site plan. All other requirements of this
chapter apply.
   (W)   Colors. In order to avoid or remedy the intangible public harm of
unsightly or out-of-character deployments, all equipment mounted on a pole,
including antennas, must match the color of the pole. Colors for all facilities
in historic districts must be in accordance with the city heritage resource
district design guidelines. Colors in design districts with decorative poles
must be approved by the Planning Director.

      (3)   Workers' compensation and employers' liability coverage. Statutory
coverage limits for Coverage A and $500,000 Coverage B employers' liability is
required.
   (B)   Public infrastructure contractors. Each public infrastructure
contractor applying for a permit shall obtain, maintain, and provide proof of
insurance for the same types of insurance coverages outlined in division (A);
however, the policy limits under the general liability insurance shall be
$1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate. All other coverage
provisions outlined in division (A) above shall apply.
   (C)   The method for proof of insurance is a certified copy of the insurance
policy. The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements and to
reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the City Manager
determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims
history of the industry, the agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor require adjustment of the coverage.
   (D)   The city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the
State of Texas or letters written by the agency in those instances where the
state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required
herein. However, certificates of self-insurance must be approved in advance by
the Risk Manager for the city.
   (E)   The agency, network provider or public infrastructure contractor shall
furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing
the coverage required by this section to the city. If the city requests a
deletion, revision or modification, the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and
accomplish the change.
   (F)   The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor
shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the engineering department. An
insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to
city approval, through the city's Risk Manager. The city may require the
certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability limits. An agency,
network provider, or public infrastructure contractor shall immediately advise
the City Attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop which may
affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify the city.
   (G)   Such insurance shall be kept in full force and effect during the
period of time for which a permit shall be issued or the space occupied.
Insurance coverage must be available on a "per project" basis.

coverage for losses covered by the policies.
   (I)   The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city.
   (J)   The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor
shall pay premiums and assessments. A company that issues an insurance policy
has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment.
Insurance policies obtained by an agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor must provide that the issuing company waives all
right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with
damage covered by the policy.
   (K)   Each policy must include a provision that requires the insurance
company to notify the city in
writing at least 30 calendar days before canceling or failing to renew the
policy or before reducing policy limits or coverages.
   (L)   Each agency must comply with the insurance requirements in this
section, unless the agency's current franchise or license agreement with the
city specifically addresses insurance requirements, in which case the franchise
or license agreement shall control.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)

its officers and employees harmless from and against all claims, lawsuits,
judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of
action, liability, and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or
bodily injury (including death), property damage, or other harm for which

certificated telecommunications provider, agency, network provider or public
infrastructure contractor, while installing, repairing, or maintaining
facilities in a public right-of-way.
   (B)   The indemnity provided by this section does not apply to any liability
resulting from the negligence of the city, its officers, employees,
contractors, or subcontractors. If a certificated telecommunications provider,
agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor and the city are
found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be
apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of state without,
however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the city under state
law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state law.
   (C)   This section is solely for the benefit of the city and the
certificated telecommunication provider, agency, network provider or public
infrastructure contractor and does not create or grant any rights, contractual
or otherwise, to any other person or entity.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.14 PERFORMANCE WARRANTY/GUARANTEE.
   (A)   Any warranty made hereunder shall serve as security for the
performance of work necessary to repair the public rights-of-way if the agency,
network provider, or public infrastructure contractor fails to make the
necessary repairs or to complete the work under the permit.
   (B)   The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor, by

§ 96.17 PLANS OF RECORD.
   (A)   Any agency or network provider with facilities in the public rights-
of-way shall submit plans of record in accordance with the following
requirements:
      (1)   A city street map marked in such a manner as to evidence which Type
F and above thoroughfares along which the agency or network provider has placed

(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.18 GENERAL RIGHTS-OF-WAY USE AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Responsibility for employees, courtesy and drug policy. Agencies,
network providers and infrastructure contractors shall be responsible and
liable for the acts and omissions of their employees, temporary employees,
officers, directors, consultants, agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and
subcontractors in connection with the installations of facilities in the right-
of-way, as if such acts or omissions were agency's, network provider's, or
public infrastructure contractor's acts or omissions. Work in the public
rights-of-way shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with
the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. Citizen
satisfaction must be a priority in using the right-of-way. Agencies, network
providers, and infrastructure contractors shall train their employees to be
customer service-oriented and to positively and politely interact with citizens
when dealing with issues pertaining to its facilities in the right-of-way.
Employees shall be clean, courteous, efficient, and neat in appearance and
committed to offering the highest quality of interaction with the public. If,
in the opinion of the City Manager, the employee is not interacting in a
positive and polite manner with citizens, he or she shall request that the
agency, network provider or infrastructure contractor take all remedial steps
to conform to these standards. It is the policy of the city to achieve a drug-
free workforce and workplace. The manufacture, distribution, dispensation,
possession, sale, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol by agency’s, network
provider's or infrastructure contractor's employees, contractors,
subcontractors, or vendors while on city rights-of-way is prohibited.
   (B)   Minimal interference. Agency’s, network provider’s, or public
infrastructure contractor's facilities shall be constructed or maintained in
such a manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other
property of the city, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals,
structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the rights-of-way
by, or under, the city's authority. The agency's, network provider's or public
infrastructure contractor's facilities shall be located, erected, and
maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to
interfere with improvements the city may deem proper to make or to
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the rights-of-way or other
public property, and shall not interfere with the travel and use of public
places by the public during the construction, repair, operation, or removal
thereof, and shall not obstruct or impede traffic. The agency, network
provider, or infrastructure contractor shall not cause any interference with
city public safety radio system, traffic signal light system, or other city
safety communications components.
   (C)   Responsibilities under permit; location of facilities.
      (1)   A permit does not relieve an agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor of the responsibility to coordinate with other
utilities and to protect existing facilities. An agency, network provider, or
public infrastructure contractor working in the right-of-way is responsible for
obtaining line locates from all affected utilities or others with facilities in
the right-of-way prior to any excavation. Use of the geographic information
system or the plans of record does not satisfy this requirement.
      (2)   In performing location of facilities in the public rights-of-way in
preparation for construction under a permit, agency, network provider, or
public infrastructure contractor shall compile all information obtained
regarding its or any other facilities in the public rights-of-way related to a
particular permit and shall make that information available to the city in a
written and verified format acceptable to the City Engineer.
      (3)   Protection of utilities. Before beginning excavation in any public
right-of-way, an agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor
shall contact the Texas One-Call System or any other company operating under
the One-Call Statute and, to the extent required by Tex. Utilities Code Ch.
251, make inquiries of all ditch companies, utility companies, districts, local
government departments, and all other agencies that might have facilities in
the area of work to determine possible conflicts.
         (a)   Field locations shall be marked prior to commencing work. The
agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor shall support and
protect all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus that may be
affected by the work from damage during construction or settlement of trenches
subsequent to construction.
         (b)   A person shall only use a water-based paint in the public right-
of-way to mark the location of existing underground utilities. A person commits
an offense, if a marking he or she makes in the public right-of-way to mark the
location of existing underground utilities remains visible longer than 60
calendar days after being applied.
   (D)   Underground construction and use of poles.
      (1)   Facilities shall be maintained in an appropriate manner.
      (2)   Should the city desire to place its own facilities in trenches or
bores opened by the agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor, the agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor
shall cooperate with the city in any construction by the agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor that involves trenching or
boring, provided that the city has first notified the agency, network provider,
or public infrastructure contractor in some manner that it is interested in
sharing the trenches or bores in the area in which the agency's, network
provider's or public infrastructure contractor's construction is occurring. The
agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor shall allow the
city to place its facilities in the agency's, network provider's or public
infrastructure contractor's trenches and bores, provided the city incurs any
incremental increase in cost of the trenching and boring. The city shall be
responsible for maintaining its respective facilities buried in the agency's,
network provider's or public infrastructure contractor's trenches and bores
under this division.
   (E)   Joint trenching. The public rights-of-way have a finite capacity for
containing facilities. The City Engineer may require an agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor to share trench space to minimize
the disruption of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. All facilities shall meet
any applicable local, state, and federal clearance and other safety
requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of
any contracts executed between agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor and the other joint user. Agency, network provider,
or public infrastructure contractor may, at its option, correct any attachment
deficiencies and charge the joint user for its costs.
   (F)   Excavation safety. On construction projects in which excavation will
exceed a depth of five feet, the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor must have detailed plans and specifications for
excavation safety systems. The term EXCAVATION includes trenches, structural or
any construction that has earthen excavation subject to collapse. The
excavation safety plan shall be designed in conformance with state law and
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and regulations.
   (G)   Erosion control. The agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor shall be responsible for storm water management
erosion control that complies with city, state and federal guidelines. All
installations shall comply with city standard construction details, as amended.
   (H)   On-site requirements. Agencies, network providers and public
infrastructure contractors subject to this chapter must have a minimum of one
English-speaking representative at the site where work is being performed at
all times. Additionally, each of agency's, or network provider's or public
infrastructure contractor's vehicles shall bear a sign identifying the agency,
network provider, or public infrastructure contractor that owns the vehicles.
   (I)   Electrical supply. Agencies, network providers and public
infrastructure contractors are responsible for obtaining any required
electrical power services to their facilities. The city shall not be liable for
any stoppages or shortages of electrical power furnished to the facilities,
including without limitation, stoppages or shortages caused by any act,
omission, or requirement of the public utility serving the facilities or the
act or omission of any other tenant of the structure or user of the right-of-
way, or for any other cause beyond the control of the city. Generators and
back-up generators are prohibited in the right-of-way.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.19 NO DIRECTIONAL BORING ZONES.
   In the city, the public infrastructure must be maintained and protected by
all agencies, network providers, and public infrastructure contractors. The
public health, safety and welfare is at risk when damages to water and sewer
mains occur. To protect the water and sewer system, no person, agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor will be allowed to directionally
bore longitudinally with water and sewer mains that are 12-inches or larger.
The installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way will be installed by
open excavation to assure the protection of the city's water and sewer system.
The city has available mapping that identifies such mains. The agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor is responsible for obtaining and
using this information in the design of new facilities. When boring is
acceptable, pothole process is required for 12-inches or larger water and sewer
mains or any main that is deemed critical by the city. Bore time is restricted
to the following schedule: 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 7:00
a.m. to noon on Friday and no bore on Saturday and Sunday. Missiles are not
considered directional boring and are not allowed unless otherwise approved by
the city.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.20 JOINT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION; COORDINATION OF EXCAVATIONS.
   (A)   Excavations in city rights-of-way disrupt and interfere with the
public use of the city streets and damage the pavement and landscaping. The
purpose of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage
by promoting better coordination among agencies, network providers, or public
infrastructure contractors making excavations in public rights-of-way and
between these agencies, network providers and public infrastructure contractors
and the city. Better coordination will assist in minimizing the number of
excavations being made wherever feasible and will ensure the excavations in
city rights-of-way are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before,
rather than after, the reconstruction of the streets by the city.
   (B)   Utility coordination meeting.
      (1)   The city will hold a utility coordination meeting a minimum of two
times per year. The purpose of the meeting is for the city to inform agencies,
network providers, and public infrastructure contractors of proposed and
current community investment projects in the city and also for the agencies,
network providers, and public infrastructure contractors to inform each other
and the city of current and future projects. Each agency, network provider and
public infrastructure contractor is encouraged to attend and participate in the
meetings of the city, of which the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor will be made aware.
      (2)   The city will notify the affected agencies, network providers, and
public infrastructure contractors at least six months before construction will
start on a city project. Preliminary plans will be provided to the affected
agencies, network providers, and public infrastructure contractors at least
four months before the project is to start construction. Final plans will be
provided to the affected agencies, network providers, and public infrastructure
contractors at least two months before the project is to start construction.
      (3)   Whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable to joint trench
or share bores or cuts, the agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor shall work with other agencies, network providers, and public
infrastructure contractors so as to reduce as much as possible the number of
right-of-way cuts within the city.
   (C)   Excavation master plan. In addition to participating in the utility
coordination meetings, any agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor owning, operating or installing facilities in public rights-of-way,
providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video, or other utility
services, shall meet annually with the City Engineer, at the City Engineer's
request, to discuss agency's, network provider's, or public infrastructure
contractor's excavation master plan. At such meeting, to the extent not already
in possession of the city, agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor shall submit documentation, in a form required by the City Engineer,
showing the location of the agency's, network provider's, or public
infrastructure contractor's existing facilities in the public rights-of-way.
      (1)   Agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor shall
discuss with the City Engineer its excavation master plan and identify planned
major excavation work in the city. The City Engineer may make his or her own
record on a map, drawing, or other documentation of each agency's or network
provider's or public infrastructure contractor's planned major excavation work
in the city; provided, however, that no such document prepared by the City
Engineer shall identify a particular entity, or the planned major excavation
work of that particular entity.
      (2)   Each agency or public infrastructure contractor shall submit
annually, on or before March 31, a revised and updated excavation master plan.
As used in this division, the term PLANNED MAJOR EXCAVATION WORK refers to any
future excavations planned by the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor when the excavation master plan or update is
submitted that will affect any public rights-of-way for more than five business
days, provided that the agency, network provider, or public infrastructure
contractor shall not be required to identify future major excavations planned
to occur more than three years after the date that the agency's, network
provider's, or public infrastructure contractor's master plan or update is
discussed.
      (3)   Between the annual meetings to discuss planned major excavation
work, agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor shall
inform the City Engineer of any substantial changes in the planned major
excavation work discussed at the annual meeting. The city will not preclude an
agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor from obtaining a
permit for a project that was inadvertently excluded from the agency's, network
provider's or infrastructure contractor's excavation master plan or was unknown

located in the right-of-way. The foregoing shall not relieve the agency,
network provider, or infrastructure contractor from complying with any city
graffiti or visual blight ordinance or regulation.
   (K)   Signage. Agency, network provider, or infrastructure contractor shall
post its name, location identifying information, and emergency telephone number
in an area on the cabinet of the facility that is visible to the public.

(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.23 REQUIREMENTS FOR STREET CUTS AND REPAIRS.
   (A)   The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor
shall be responsible for maintaining all street cuts in such a manner as to
avoid a hazard to vehicular and pedestrian traffic until permanently repaired.
      (1)   When emergency repairs are deemed necessary by the City Engineer to
correct a situation that is hazardous to the public, the agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor that is responsible for the cut
shall be notified immediately. If the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor does not provide an acceptable schedule for making
the emergency repair within eight hours of being notified, the repairs will be
performed by the city, and the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor will be billed for the repairs necessary to complete
the project, including clean up.
      (2)   Agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor will
be required to maintain the interim cut repair until they have completed final
repairs.
      (3)   Traffic-bearing steel plates shall be utilized on all concrete
paving cuts until required curing is accomplished. Asphalt shall be used to
provide smooth ramps at the edges. Plates or asphalt may be used for temporary
repairs.
   (B)   All damage caused directly or indirectly to the street surface or
subsurface outside the pavement cut area shall be regarded as a part of the
street cut. These areas, as established by the City Inspector, will be included
in the total area repaired.
   (C)   The agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor
shall notify the Public Works Department immediately of any damage to other
utilities, either city or privately owned.
   (D)   Construction methods.
      (1)   The city’s special provisions to standard specifications for public
works construction and the city’s standard construction details shall govern
the cutting and restoration of street and alley pavements in the city. These
requirements shall apply equally to any person, public infrastructure
contractor, network provider, agency or city department who makes cuts and
repairs to streets and alleys in the city. Any above or in-ground equipment
shall not be partially or completely within the sidewalk area, or within 18-
inches of the paved sidewalk, unless otherwise approved by the city.
      (2)   Permanent repairs of utility cuts in existing streets, alleys or
easements will be completed by the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor within 14 calendar days of beginning the work. If an
agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor does not believe
that it will be able to meet this schedule, the agency, network provider, or
public infrastructure contractor must contact the City Engineer concerning an
alternative schedule for the repairs. Any alternative schedule must be approved
by the City Engineer prior to the beginning of the work. The agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor will be responsible for any
maintenance of the repair for a period of one year after the repair is
complete. Failure to do so will result in the use of the agency's, network
provider's or public infrastructure contractor's performance warranty/guarantee
by the city to repair any damage, and, possibly, the requirement of additional
warrantee(s) and/or the denial of future permits.
      (3)   Steel plates left in the right-of-way after repairs are completed
will be removed by the city and become the city's property.
      (4)   Excavation in street or alley pavements should begin with an air-
hammer shovel, a pavement breaker or other equipment that will not damage the
pavement outside an approximate width of the ditch prior to beginning trenching
operations. All street excavations will be saw cut before the street is
repaired. Full depth saw cuts are required.
      (5)   If the excavation is to pass under where the curb is installed
without dummy/expansion joint, the agency, network provider, or public
infrastructure contractor may saw cut a smooth line one foot beyond each side
of the disturbed base. If no damage to curb is evident to the City Inspector,
the agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor may pump
concrete under curb and gutter on cuts less than one-foot wide. The City
Inspector will make this determination prior to concrete being placed under
existing curb and gutter.
   (E)   Notification of homeowners' and homeowner associations. When an
agency, network provider, or public infrastructure contractor is installing
more than 500 linear feet of underground facilities, the agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor shall notify in writing all
homeowner associations, from information maintained by the city, and individual
homeowners along the route. Door hangers are an acceptable form of written
notification. This notification shall give information about the project, not
limited to the proposed location of the facilities, the time length for
construction and a contact person to report any problems. The agency, network
provider, or public infrastructure contractor must also contact all homeowner
associations concerning the location of any underground improvements.
(Ord. O-23-978, passed 7-17-2023)
§ 96.24 STANDARDS FOR REPAIR AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Agency, network provider, public infrastructure contractor

new streets shall be approved unless the City Engineer finds that all of the
following criteria have been met:
      (1)   Boring or jacking without disturbing the pavement is not practical
due to physical characteristics of the street or alley or other utility
conflicts.
      (2)   Alternative utility alignments that do not involve excavating the
street or alley are found to be impracticable.
      (3)   The proposed excavation cannot reasonably be delayed after the
three-year deferment period has lapsed.
   (C)   Exemptions for emergency operations. Emergency maintenance operations
shall be limited to circumstances involving the preservation of life, property,
or the restoration of customer service. Agencies, network providers, or public
infrastructure contractors with prior authorization from the City Engineer to

to the enforcement provisions contained herein.
   (C)   A permit will be required when making facility adjustments in
preparation for city projects, unless the adjustments are exempt under §
96.09(B).
   (D)   If the agency, network provider or public infrastructure contractor
fails to remove or relocate its facilities as requested within 90 calendar days
of receipt of the request, then the city shall be entitled to remove the
facilities at the sole cost and expense of the agency, network provider, or
infrastructure contractor without further notice. Agency or network provider
shall, within 30 calendar days following issuance of invoice for the same,
reimburse the city for its reasonable expenses incurred in the removal
(including, without limitation, overhead and storage expenses) of the
facilities. A hold may be placed on any permits not approved until payment is
received.
   (E)   The duty to remove and relocate at the agency, network provider, or
public infrastructure contractor's expense is not contingent on the
availability of an alternative location acceptable for relocation.

   (C)   False fire alarm notifications. Acknowledging the critical nature of
fire response and the need to minimize false alarms, the fee structure is as
follows: If the permit holder has two false fire alarm notifications within a

alarm notification. The fee amount will be determined based on the latest
revision of the city's comprehensive fee ordinance.
   (D)   Payment of fees.

the revocation of the alarm permit.
   (E)   Exemption for governmental units. No service fee shall be assessed
against a governmental unit, acknowledging their public service role within the

associated with emergency response to false alarms.

§ 97.04 PROTECTION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
   (A)   Recognizing the unique security needs of financial institutions within

the removal of the installed equipment and indicators at the financial
institution's expense.
         (b)   Service and maintenance. The financial institution is
responsible for all service and maintenance of the alarm system at its expense.
The city shall not be liable for any service charges, repairs, or maintenance
of the alarm system installed under this agreement.
         (c)   Cancellation and removal. The financial institution may cancel
its letter of agreement with the city at any time by providing written notice
to the Director. Upon cancellation, the institution is required to promptly
remove its equipment and indicators from the monitoring panel in the Department
of Public Safety, with all associated costs covered by the financial
institution.
   (B)   The provisions set forth in this section ensure that financial
institutions within the city are afforded the necessary means to protect their
premises while maintaining a clear framework for the installation, maintenance,
and eventual removal of direct alarm systems. This collaborative approach
between the city and financial institutions aims to enhance public safety and
response capabilities to incidents of burglary and robbery at these critical
establishments.

applicable provisions of this chapter. The financial institution is required to
formalize its commitment through a letter of agreement with the city, granting

panel located within the communications division of the Department of Public
Safety. The cost of installation shall be fully borne by the financial
institution.

institution and the city will include conditions that ensure the system's
reliability and compliance with city standards, including:

representative may inspect the alarm system annually, ensuring it meets the
necessary standards. The financial institution is obligated to rectify any
issues identified during the inspection promptly. Failure to comply can result
in the termination of the agreement and the removal of the alarm system at the
institution's expense.
      (2)   Service and maintenance obligations. The financial institution
agrees to bear all costs for the service and maintenance of the alarm system.
The city shall not incur any liability for service charges, maintenance, or
repair of the system.
      (3)   Cancellation and equipment removal. The financial institution
retains the right to cancel the agreement at any time, provided it furnishes
written notice to the Director. Upon cancellation, the institution must remove
its equipment and indicators from the Department of Public Safety's monitoring
panel at its own expense.

in accordance with Section 404 shall be prepared and maintained for Group E
occupancies and for buildings containing both a Group E occupancy and an
atrium. A diagram depicting two evacuation routes shall be posted in a
conspicuous location in each classroom. Group E occupancies shall also comply
with Sections 403.5.1 through 403.5.3.
            Reason: The diagrams are intended to assist with egress in such
occupancies - specifically, the primary teacher is not always present to assist
children with egress. Also, such will help reinforce evacuation drill
requirements.
      (32)   Section 404.2.2; add Number 4.10 to read as follows:
         4.10 Fire extinguishing system controls.
            Reason: The committee believed this information could be of great
help to such plans to facilitate locating sprinkler valves to minimize water
damage, for instance.
      (33)   Section 405.4.
         405.4 Time. The fire code official may require an evacuation drill at
any time. Drills shall be held at unexpected times and under varying conditions
to simulate the unusual conditions that occur in case of fire.
            Reason: This change clarifies who may require a fire or evacuation
drill.
      (34)   Section 501.4.
         501.4 Timing of Installation. When fire apparatus access roads or a
water supply for fire protection is required to be installed for any structure
or development, they shall be
      installed, tested, and approved prior to the time of which construction
has progressed beyond completion of the foundation of any structure.
            Reason: Reflects current practice in the region relative to
ensuring fire department and EMS access during construction, which can be a
time of increased frequency for emergency incidents.
      (35)   Section 503.1.1; add sentence to read as follows:
         Except for one-or-two-family dwellings, the path of measurement shall
be along a minimum of ten feet (10') wide unobstructed pathway around the
external walls of the structure.
               Reason: Recognizes that the hose lay provision can only be
measured along a pathway that is wide enough for fire fighter access.
      (36)   Section 503.2.1.
         503.2.1 Dimensions. Fire apparatus access roads shall have an
unobstructed width of not less than 24 feet, exclusive of shoulders, except for
approved security gates in accordance with Section 503.6, and an unobstructed
vertical clearance of not less than 14 feet.
            Exception: Vertical clearance may be reduced; provided such
reduction does not impair access by fire apparatus and approved signs are
installed and maintained indicating the established vertical clearance when
approved.
            Reason: Amendments to 503.2.1 and 503.2.2 recognize that the
equipment now used in firefighting is increasing in size. The code already
recognizes that larger dimensions may be required under Section 503.2.2. The
amendments are to standardize the dimensions for this area. With the increase
in fire apparatus size, this will allow for the passage of two fire apparatus
during a fire or EMS emergency.)
      (37)   Section 503.2.2.
         503.2.2 Authority. The fire code official shall have the authority to
require an increase in the minimum access widths and vertical clearances where
they are inadequate for fire or rescue operations.
            Reason: Amendments to 503.2.1 and 503.2.2 recognize that the
equipment now used in firefighting is increasing in size. The code already
recognizes that larger dimensions may be required under Section 503.2.2. The
amendments are to standardize the dimensions for this area. With the increase
in fire apparatus size, this will allow for the passage of two fire apparatus
during afire or EMS emergency.
      (38)   Section 503.2.3.
         503.2.3 Surface. Fire apparatus access roads shall be designed and
maintained to support imposed loads of 80,000 Lbs. for fire apparatus and shall
be surfaced so as to provide all weather driving capabilities.
            Reason: To address the current size of fire trucks in use - figure
derived from DOT requirements for waiver of vehicle exceeding such weight.
      (39)   Section 503.3.
         503.3 Marking. Striping, signs, or other markings, when approved by
the fire code official, shall be provided for fire apparatus access roads to
identify such roads or prohibit the obstruction thereof. Striping, signs, and
other markings shall be maintained in a clean and legible condition at all
times and be replaced or repaired when necessary to provide adequate
visibility.
            (1) Striping - Fire apparatus access roads shall be continuously
marked by painted lines of red traffic paint six inches (6") in width to show
the boundaries of the lane. The words "NO PARKING FIRE LANE" or "FIRE LANE NO
PARKING" shall appear in four inch (4") white letters at 25 feet intervals on
the red border markings along both sides of the fire lanes. Where a curb is
available, the striping shall be on the vertical face of the curb.
            (2) Signs - Signs shall read "NO PARKING FIRE LANE" or "FIRE LANE
NO PARKING" and shall be 12" wide and 18" high. Signs shall be painted on a
white background with letters and borders in red, using not less than 2"
lettering. Signs shall be permanently affixed to a stationary post and the
bottom of the sign shall be six feet, six inches (6'6") above finished grade.
Signs shall be spaced not more than fifty feet (50') apart along both sides of
the fire lane. Signs may be installed on permanent buildings or walls or as
approved by the Fire Chief /Fire Marshal.
               Reason: Establishes a standard method of marking and reflects
local long-standing practices.
      (40)   Section 503.4.
         503.4 Obstruction of Fire Apparatus Access Roads. Fire apparatus
access roads shall not be obstructed in any manner, including the parking of
vehicles. The minimum widths and clearances established in Section 503.2.1 and
any area marked as a fire lane as described in Section 503.3 shall be
maintained at all times.
            Reason: As originally worded, the section implied that vehicles
could be parked in the marked fire lane and not be in violation if the minimum
width is still maintained. Current accepted enforcement practice is to require
the entire marked fire lane to be maintained clear and unobstructed.
      (41)   Section 505.1; change to read as follows:
         505.1 Address Identification. New and existing buildings shall be
provided with approved address identification. The address identification shall
be legible and placed in a position that is visible from the street or road
fronting the property. Address identification characters shall contrast with
their background. Address numbers shall be Arabic numbers or alphabetical
letters. Numbers shall not be spelled out. Each character shall be not less
than 6 inches high with a minimum stroke width of ½ inch. Where required by the
fire code official, address numbers shall be provided in additional approved
locations to facilitate emergency response. Where access is by means of a
private road, buildings do not immediately front a street, and/or the building
cannot be viewed from the public way, a monument, pole or other sign with
approved 6 inch height building numerals or addresses and 4 inch height suite/
apartment numerals of a color contrasting with the background of the building
or other approved means shall be used to identify the structure. Numerals or
addresses shall be posted on a minimum 20 inch by 30 inch background on border.
Address identification shall be maintained.
            Exception: R-3 Single Family occupancies shall have approved
numerals of a minimum 3 ½ inches in height and a color contrasting with the
background clearly visible and legible from the street fronting the property
and rear alleyway where such alleyway exists.
            Reason: To increase the minimum addressing requirements for
commercial properties and establish a minimum for single-family residential
properties. Such improves legibility of these signs which are critical to
emergency response in a more timely manner.
      (42)   Section 507.4.
         507.4 Water Supply Test Date and Information. The water supply test
used for hydraulic calculation of fire protection systems shall be conducted in
accordance with NFPA 291 "Recommended Practice for Fire Flow Testing and
Marking of Hydrants" and within one year of sprinkler plan submittal. The fire
code official shall be notified prior to the water supply test. Water supply
tests shall be witnessed by the fire code official, as required the exact
location of the static/residual hydrant and the flow hydrant shall be indicated
on the design drawings. All fire protection plan submittals shall be
accompanied by a hard copy of the waterflow test report, or as approved by the
fire code official. The report must indicate the dominant water tank level at
the time of the test and the maximum and minimum operating levels of the tank,
as well, or identify applicable water supply fluctuation. The licensed
contractor must then design the fire protection system based on this
fluctuation information, as per the applicable referenced NFPA standard.
Reference Section 903.3.5 for additional design requirements.
            Reason: Clarifies intent of the test to ensure contractor accounts
for water supply fluctuations.
      (43)   Section 507.5.4.
         507.5.4 Obstruction. Unobstructed access to fire hydrants shall be
maintained at all times. Posts, fences, vehicles, growth, trash, storage and
other materials or objects shall not be placed or kept near fire hydrants, fire
department inlet connections or fire protection system control valves in a
manner that would prevent such equipment or fire hydrants from being
immediately discernible. The fire department shall not be deterred or hindered
from gaining immediate access to fire protection equipment or fire hydrants.
            Reason: Additional guidance based on legacy language to ensure
these critical devices are available in an emergency incident.
      (44)   Section 509.1.2.
         509.1.2 Sign Requirements. Unless more stringent requirements apply,
lettering for signs required by this section shall have a minimum height of 2
inches when located inside a building and 4 inches when located outside, or as
approved by the fire code official. The letters shall be of a color that
contrasts with the background.
            Reason: Provides direction as to appropriate sign criteria to
develop local and regional consistency in this regard.
      (45)   Sections 603.3.1, 603.3.2 and 603.3.2.1.
         603.3.1 Fuel oil storage in outside, above-ground tanks. Where
connected to a fuel-oil piping system, the maximum amount of fuel oil storage
allowed outside above ground without additional protection shall be 660
gallons. The storage of fuel oil above ground in quantities exceeding 660
gallons shall comply with NFPA 31 and Chapter 57.
         603.3.2 Fuel oil storage inside buildings. Fuel oil storage inside
buildings shall comply with Sections 603.3.2.1 through 603.3.2.5 and Chapter
57.
         603.3.2.1 Quantity limits. One or more fuel oil storage tanks
containing Class II or III combustible liquid shall be permitted in a building.
The aggregate capacity of all tanks shall not exceed the following:
            1.   660 gallons in un-sprinklered buildings, where stored in a
tank complying with UL 80, UL 142 or UL 2085 for Class III liquids, and also
listed as a double-wall/secondary containment tank for Class II liquids.
            2.   1,320 gallons in buildings equipped with an automatic
sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1, where stored in a tank
complying with UL 142 or UL 2085 as a double-wall/secondary containment tank.
            3.   3,000 gallons where stored in protected above-ground tanks
complying with UL 2085 and Section 5704.2.9.7 and the room is protected by an
automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1.
            Reason: Issues addressed by Chapter 57, such as venting to outside
of buildings, remote fill to outside of building, overfill protection, physical
protection, etc., are not included in Section 603.3, so compliance with Chapter
57 is also required. The Board determined that fuel storage in such tanks
inside of buildings is commonly in double-wall tanks, and that this inherent
leak protection was prudent in order to allow these quantities of combustible
liquids to be stored inside a building for such purpose.
      (46)   Sections 807.5.2.2 and 807.5.2.3.
         807.5.2.2 Artwork in Corridors. Artwork and teaching materials shall
be limited on the walls of corridors to not more than 20 percent of the wall
area. Such materials shall not be continuous from floor to ceiling or wall to
wall. Curtains, draperies, wall hangings, and other decorative material
suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the flame propagation
performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section 807 or be
noncombustible.
            Exception: Corridors protected by an approved automatic sprinkler
system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 shall be limited to SO
percent of the wall area.
         807.5.2.3 Artwork in Classrooms. Artwork and teaching materials shall
be limited on walls of classrooms to not more than 50 percent of the specific
wall area to which they are attached.
         Curtains, draperies, wall hangings and other decorative material
suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the flame propagation
performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section 807 or be
noncombustible.
            Reason: This change allows an increase in wall coverage due to the
presence of sprinklers. Also provides additional guidance relative to fire
resistance requirements in these areas.
      (47)   Sections 807.5.5.2 and 807.5.5.3.
         807.5.5.2 Artwork in Corridors. Artwork and teaching materials shall
be limited on the walls of corridors to not more than 20 percent of the wall
area. Such materials shall not be continuous from floor to ceiling or wall to
wall. Curtains, draperies, wall hangings and other decorative material
suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the flame propagation
performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section 807 or be
noncombustible.
            Exception: Corridors protected by an approved automatic sprinkler
system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 shall be limited to 50
percent of the wall area.
         807.5.5.3 Artwork in Classrooms. Artwork and teaching materials shall
be limited on walls of classrooms to not more than 50 percent of the specific
wall area to which they are attached. Curtains, draperies, wall hangings and
other decorative material suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the
flame propagation performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section
807 or be noncombustible.
            Reason: This change allows an increase in wall coverage due to the
presence of sprinklers. Also provides additional guidance relative to fire
resistance requirements in these areas.
      (48)   Section 901.6.1; add Section 901.6.1.1.
         901.6.1.1 Standpipe Testing. Building owners/managers must maintain
and test standpipe systems as per NFPA 25 requirements. The following
additional requirements shall be applied to the testing that is required every
5 years:
         1.   The piping between the Fire Department Connection (FDC) and the
standpipe shall be backflushed or inspected by approved camera when foreign
material is present or when caps are missing, and also hydrostatically tested
for all FDC's on any type of standpipe system. Hydrostatic testing shall also
be conducted in accordance with NFPA 25 requirements for the different types of
standpipe systems.
      2.   For any manual (dry or wet) standpipe system not having an automatic
water supply capable of flowing water through the standpipe, the tester shall
connect hose from a fire hydrant or portable pumping system (as approved by the
fire code official) to each FDC, and flow water through the standpipe system to
the roof outlet to verify that each inlet connection functions properly.
Confirm that there are no open hose valves prior to introducing water into a
dry standpipe. There is no required pressure criteria at the outlet. Verify
that check valves function properly and that there are no closed control valves
on the system.
         3.   Any pressure relief, reducing, or control valves shall be tested
in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 25. All hose valves shall be
exercised.
         4.   If the FDC is not already provided with approved caps, the
contractor shall install such caps for all FDC's as required by the fire code
official.
         5.   Upon successful completion of standpipe test, place a blue tag
(as per Texas Administrative Code, Fire Sprinkler Rules for Inspection, Test
and Maintenance Service (ITM) Tag) at the bottom of each standpipe riser in the
building. The tag shall be check-marked as "Fifth Year" for Type of ITM, and
the note on the back of the tag shall read "5 Year Standpipe Test" at a
minimum.
         6.   The procedures required by Texas Administrative Code Fire
Sprinkler Rules with regard to Yellow Tags and Red Tags or any deficiencies
noted during the testing, including the required notification of the local
Authority Having Jurisdiction (fire code official) shall be followed.
         7.   Additionally, records of the testing shall be maintained by the
owner and contractor, if applicable, as required by the State Rules mentioned
above and NFPA 25.
         8.   Standpipe system tests where water will be flowed external to the
building shall not be conducted during freezing conditions or during the day
prior to expected night time freezing conditions.
         9.   Contact the fire code official for requests to remove existing
fire hose from Class II and III standpipe systems where employees are not
trained in the utilization of this firefighting equipment. All standpipe hose
valves must remain in place and be provided with an approved cap and chain when
approval is given to remove hose by the fire code official.
               Reason: Increases the reliability of the fire protection system
and re-emphasizes the requirements of NFPA 25 relative to standpipe systems, as
well as ensuring that FDC connections are similarly tested/maintained to ensure
operation in an emergency incident.
      (49)   Section 901.6.4; add Section 901.6.4.
         901.6.4 False Alarms and Nuisance Alarms. False alarms and nuisance
alarms shall not be given, signaled, or transmitted or caused or permitted to
be given, signaled or transmitted in any manner.
            Reason: Places the responsibility on the business or property owner
to maintain their fire alarm systems in approved condition. Allows the
enforcement of "prohibition of false alarms". Replaces text lost from the
legacy codes that helps to ensure the maintenance of life safety systems.
      (50)   Section 901.7.
         901.7 Systems Out of Service.  Where a required fire protection system
is out of service or in the event of an excessive number of activations, the
fire department and the fire code official shall be notified immediately and,
where required by the fire code official, the building shall either be
evacuated, or an approved fire watch shall be provided for all occupants left
unprotected by the shut down until the fire protection system has been returned
to service.... {'{'}Remaining text unchanged{'}'}
            Reason: Gives fire code official more discretion with regards to
enforcement of facilities experiencing nuisance alarm or fire protection system
activations necessitating correction/repair/replacement. The intent of the
amendment is to allow local jurisdictions to enforce fire watches, etc., where
needed to ensure safety of occupants where fire protection systems are
experiencing multiple nuisance activations.
      (51)   Section 903.1.1.
         903.1.1 Alternative Protection. Alternative automatic fire-
extinguishing systems complying with Section 904 shall be permitted in addition
to automatic sprinkler protection were recognized by the applicable standard,
or as approved by the fire code official.
            Reason: Such alternative systems do not provide the reliability of
automatic sprinkler protection. Most gaseous type systems are highly
susceptible to open doors, ceiling or floor tile removal, etc. However, an
applicant could pursue an Alternate Method request to help mitigate the
reliability issues with these alternative systems with the fire code official
if so desired, or there may be circumstances in which the fire code official is
acceptable to allowing an alternate system in lieu of sprinklers, such as
kitchen hoods or paint booths.
      (52)   Section 903.2; add paragraph to read as follows and delete the
exception:
         Automatic Sprinklers shall not be installed in elevator machine rooms,
elevator machine spaces, and elevator hoistways, other than pits where such
sprinklers would not necessitate shunt trip requirements under any
circumstances. Storage shall not be allowed within the elevator machine room.
Signage shall be provided at the entry doors to the elevator machine room
indicating "ELEVATOR MACHINERY - NO STORAGE ALLOWED."
            Reason: Firefighter and public safety. This amendment eliminates
the shunt trip requirement of the International Building Code Section 3005.5
for the purpose of elevator passenger and firefighter safety. This amendment is
contingent on the Building Code amendment eliminating the Exceptions to Section
3005.4, such that passive fire barriers for these areas are maintained. The
exception deletion is due to the fact that such telecom areas pose an undue
fire risk to the structural integrity of the building.
      (53)   Section 903.2.9; add Section 903.2.9.3
         903.2.9.3 Self-Service Storage Facility. An automatic sprinkler system
shall be installed throughout all self-service storage facilities.
            Reason: Fire departments are unable to inspect these commercial
occupancies and are unaware of the contents being stored. Previous allowance to
separate units by fire barriers is difficult to enforce maintenance after
opening.
      (54)   Section 903.2.11; change 903.2.11.3 and add 903.2.11.7 and
903.2.11.8.
         903.2.11.3 Buildings 55 Feet or more in Height. An automatic sprinkler
system shall be installed throughout buildings that have one or more stories,
other than penthouses in compliance with Section 1510 of the International
Building Code, located 55 feet or more above the lowest level of fire
department vehicle access, measured to the finished floor.
            Exceptions:
            1.   Open parking structures in compliance with Section 406.5 of
the International Building Code, having no other occupancies above the subject
garage.
         903.2.11.7 High-Piled Combustible Storage. For any building with a
clear height exceeding 12 feet, see Chapter 32 to determine if those provisions
apply.
         903.2.11.8 Spray Booths and Rooms.  New and existing spray booths and
spraying rooms shall be protected by an approved automatic fire-extinguishing
system.
            Reason: Provides jurisdictions options as to their desired level of
sprinkler protection based on multiple factors including firefighting
philosophies/capabilities.
      (55)   Section 903.3.1.1.1.
         903.3.1.1.1 Exempt Locations. When approved by the fire code official,
automatic sprinklers shall not be required in the following rooms or areas
where such ... {'{'}text unchanged) ... because it is damp, of fire-resistance-
rated construction or contains electrical equipment.
         1.   Any room where the application of water, or flame and water,
constitutes a serious life or fire hazard.
         2.   Any room or space where sprinklers are considered undesirable
because of the nature of the contents, when approved by the code official.
         3.   Generator and transformer rooms, under the direct control of a
public utility, separated from the remainder of the building by walls and
floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assemblies having a fire-resistance rating of not
less than 2 hours.
      4.   Elevator machine rooms, machinery spaces, and hoistways, other than
pits where such sprinklers would not necessitate shunt trip requirements under
any circumstances.
               Reason: Gives more direction to code official. Exception 4
deleted to provide protection where fire risks are poorly addressed. Amendment
903.2 addresses Exception 5 above relative to the elimination of sprinkler
protection in these areas to avoid the shunt trip requirement.
      (56)   Section 903.3.1.2.3.
         Section 903.3.1.2.3 Attached Garages and Attics. Sprinkler protection
is required in attached garages, and in the following attic spaces:
         1.   Attics that are used or intended for living purposes or storage
shall be protected by an automatic sprinkler system.
         2.   Where fuel-fired equipment is installed in an unsprinklered
attic, not fewer than one quick-response intermediate temperature sprinkler
shall be installed above the equipment.
         3.   Attic spaces of buildings that are two or more stories in height
above grade plane or above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access.
         4.   Group R-4, Condition 2 occupancy attics not required by Item 1 or
3 to have sprinklers shall comply with one of the following:
            4.1.   Provide automatic sprinkler system protection.
            4.2.   Provide a heat detection system throughout the attic that is
arranged to activate the building fire alarm system.
            4.3.   Construct the attic using noncombustible materials.
            4.4.   Construct the attic using fire-retardant-treated wood
complying with Section 2303.2 of the International Building Code.
            4.5.   Fill the attic with noncombustible insulation.
               Reason: Attic protection is required due to issues with fire
exposure via soffit vents, as well as firefighter safety. Several jurisdictions
indicated experience with un-protected attic fires resulting in displacement of
all building occupants. NFPA 13 provides for applicable attic sprinkler
protection requirements, as well as exemptions to such, based on noncombustible
construction, etc. Attached garages already require sprinklers via NFPA 13R -
this amendment just reemphasizes the requirement.
      (57)   Section 903.3.1.3.
         903.3.1.3 NFPA 13D Sprinkler Systems. Automatic sprinkler systems
installed in one- and two-family dwellings; Group R-3; Group R-4, Condition 1;
and townhouses shall be permitted to be installed throughout in accordance with
NFPA 13D or in accordance with state law.
            Reason: To allow the use of the Plumbing section of the
International Residential Code (IRC) and recognize current state stipulations
in this regard.
      (58)   Section 903.3.1.4; add to read as follows:
         [F] 903.3.1.4 Freeze protection. Freeze protection systems for
automatic fire sprinkler systems shall be in accordance with the requirements
of the applicable referenced NFPA standard and this section.
            903.3.1.4.1 Attics. Only dry-pipe, preaction, or listed antifreeze
automatic fire sprinkler systems shall be allowed to protect attic spaces.
               Exception: Wet-pipe fire sprinkler systems shall be allowed to
protect nonventilated attic spaces where:
               1.   The attic sprinklers are supplied by a separate floor
control valve assembly to allow ease of draining the attic system without
impairing sprinklers throughout the rest of the building, and
               2.   Adequate heat shall be provided for freeze protection as
per the applicable referenced NFPA standard, and
               3.   The attic space is a part of the building's thermal, or
heat, envelope, such that insulation is provided at the roof deck, rather than
at the ceiling level.
            903.3.1.4.2 Heat trace/insulation. Heat trace/insulation shall only
be allowed where approved by the fire code official for small sections of large
diameter waterfilled pipe.
               Reason: In the last few years, severe winters brought to light
several issues with current practices for sprinkle ring attics, not the least
of which was wet-pipe sprinklers in ventilated attics provided with space
heaters, etc. for freeze protection of such piping. This practice is not
acceptable for the protection of water-filled piping in a ventilated attic
space as it does not provide a reliable means of maintaining the minimum 40
degrees required by NFPA, wastes energy, and presents a potential ignition
source to the attic space. Listed antifreeze is specifically included because
NFPA currently allows such even though there is no currently listed antifreeze
at the time of development of these amendments. The intent of this amendment is
to help reduce the large number of freeze breaks that have occurred in the past
with water-filled wet-pipe sprinkler systems in the future, most specifically
in attic spaces.
      (59)   Section 903.3.5.
         Water supply as required for such systems shall be provided in
conformance with the supply requirements of the respective standards; however,
every water-based fire protection system shall be designed with a 10 psi safety
factor. Reference Section 507.4 for additional design requirements.
            Reason: To define uniform safety factor for the region.
      (60)   Section 903.4; add a second paragraph after the exceptions to read
as follows:
         Sprinkler and standpipe system water-flow detectors shall be provided
for each floor tap to the sprinkler system and shall cause an alarm upon
detection of water flow for more than 45 seconds. All control valves in the
sprinkler and standpipe systems except for fire department hose connection
valves shall be electrically supervised to initiate a supervisory signal at the
central station upon tampering.
            Reason: To avoid significant water losses. Consistent with
amendment to IFC 905.9.
      (61)   Section 903.4.2; add second paragraph to read as follows:
         The alarm device required on the exterior of the building shall be a
weatherproof horn/strobe notification appliance with a minimum 75 candela
strobe rating, installed as close as practicable to the fire department
connection.
            Reason: Fire department connections are not always located at the
riser; this allows the fire department faster access.
      (62)   Section 905.2.
         905.2 Installation Standard. Standpipe systems shall be installed in
accordance with this section and NFPA 14. Manual dry standpipe systems shall be
supervised with a minimum of 10 psig and a maximum of 40 psig air pressure with
a high/low alarm.
            Reason: To define manual dry standpipe supervision requirements.
Helps ensure the integrity of the standpipe system via supervision, such that
open hose valves will result in a supervisory low air alarm.
      (63)   Section 905.3.
         905.3.9 Buildings Exceeding 10,000 sq. ft.  In buildings exceeding
10,000 square feet in area per story and where any portion of the building's
interior area is more than 200 feet of travel, vertically and horizontally,
from the nearest point of fire department vehicle access, Class I automatic wet
or manual wet standpipes shall be provided.
            Exceptions:
               1.   Automatic dry, semi-automatic dry, and manual dry
standpipes are allowed as provided for in NFPA 14 where approved by the fire
code official.
               2.   R-2 occupancies of four stories or less in height having no
interior corridors.
               Reason: Allows for the rapid deployment of hose lines to the
body of the fire. Manual dry option added this edition.
      (64)   Section 905.4, change Item 1, 3, and 5, and add Item 7 to read as
follows:
         1.   In every required exit stairway, a hose connection shall be
provided for each story above and below grade plane. Hose connections shall be
located at an intermediate landing between stories, unless otherwise approved
by the fire code official.
         2.   {'{'}No change.{'}'}
         3.   In every exit passageway, at the entrance from the exit
passageway to other areas of a building.
               Exception: Where floor areas adjacent to an exit passageway are
reachable from an exit stairway hose connection by a {'{'}remainder of text
unchanged{'}'}
         4.   {'{'}No change.{'}'}
         5.   Where the roof has a slope less than four units vertical in 12
units horizontal (33.3- percent slope), each standpipe shall be provided with a
two-way hose connection located to serve the roof or at the highest landing of
an interior exit stairway with stair access to the roof provided in accordance
with Section 1011.12.
         6.   {'{'}No change.{'}'}
         7.   When required by this Chapter, standpipe connections shall be
placed adjacent to all required exits to the structure and at two hundred feet
(200') intervals along major corridors thereafter, or as otherwise approved by
the fire code official.
               Reason: Item 1, 3, and 5 amendments to remove 'interior' will
help to clarify that such connections are required for all 'exit' stairways, to
ensure firefighter capabilities are not diminished in these tall buildings,
simply because the stair is on the exterior of the building. Item 5 reduces the
amount of pressure required to facilitate testing and provides backup
protection for fire fighter safety. Item 7 allows for the rapid deployment of
hose lines to the body of the fire.
      (65)   Section 905.9; add a second paragraph after the exceptions to read
as follows:
         Sprinkler and standpipe system water-flow detectors shall be provided
for each floor tap to the sprinkler system and shall cause an alarm upon
detection of water flow for more than 45 seconds. All control valves in the
sprinkler and standpipe systems except for fire department hose connection
valves shall be electrically supervised to initiate a supervisory signal at the
central station upon tampering.
            Reason: To avoid significant water losses. Consistent with
amendment to IFC 903.4.
      (66)   Section 907.1.
         907.1.4 Design Standards. Where a new fire alarm system is installed,
the devices shall be addressable. Fire alarm systems utilizing more than 20
smoke detectors shall have analog initiating devices.
            Reason: Provides for the ability of descriptive identification of
alarms and reduces need for panel replacement in the future. Updated wording to
match the language of the new requirement at 907.5.2.3. Change of terminology
allows for reference back to definitions of NFPA 72.
      (66)   Section 907.2.1.
         907.2.1 Group A. A manual fire alarm system that activates the
occupant notification system in accordance with Section 907.5 shall be
installed in Group A occupancies having an occupant load of 300 or more
persons, or where the occupant load is more than 100 persons above or below the
lowest level of exit discharge. Group A occupancies not separated from one
another in accordance with Section 707.3.-10 of the International Building Code
shall be considered as a single occupancy for the purposes of applying this
section. Portions of Group E occupancies occupied for assembly purposes shall
be provided with a fire alarm system as required for the Group E occupancy.
            Exception: {'{'}No change.{'}'}
         Activation of fire alarm notification appliances shall:
            1.   Cause illumination of the means of egress with light of not
less than 1 foot-candle (11 lux) at the walking surface level, and
            2.   Stop any conflicting or confusing sounds and visual
distractions.
               Reason: Increases the requirement to be consistent with Group B
requirement. Also addresses issue found in Group A occupancies of reduced
lighting levels and other A/V equipment that distracts from fire alarm
notification devices or reduces ability of fire alarm system to notify
occupants of the emergency condition.
      (68)   Section 907.2.3; change to read as follows:
         907.2.3 Group E. A manual fire alarm system that initiates the
occupant notification signal utilizing an emergency voice/alarm communication
system meeting the requirements of Section 907.5.2.2 and installed in
accordance with Section 907.6 shall be installed in Group E educational
occupancies. When automatic sprinkler systems or smoke detectors are installed,
such systems or detectors shall be connected to the building fire alarm system.
An approved smoke detection system shall be installed in Group E day care
occupancies. Unless separated by a minimum of 100' open space, all buildings,
whether portable buildings or the main building, will be considered one
building for alarm occupant load consideration and interconnection of alarm
systems.
            Exceptions:
               1. {'{'}No change.{'}'}
                  1.1. Residential In-Home day care with not more than 12
children may use interconnected single station detectors in all habitable
rooms. (For care of more than five children 2 ½ or less years of age, see
Section 907.2.6.) {'{'}No change to remainder of exceptions.{'}'}
               Reason: To distinguish educational from day care occupancy
minimum protection requirements. Further, to define threshold at which portable
buildings are considered a separate building for the purposes of alarm systems.
Exceptions provide consistency with State law concerning such occupancies.
      (69)   Section 907.2.12, Exception 3.
         3.   Open air portions of buildings with an occupancy in Group A-5 in
accordance with Section 303.1 of the International Building Code; however, this
exception does not apply to accessory uses including but not limited to sky
boxes, restaurants, and similarly enclosed areas.
               Reason: To indicate that enclosed areas within open air seating
type occupancies are not exempted from automatic fire alarm system
requirements.)
      (70)   Section 907.4.2.
         907.4.2.7 Type. Manual alarm initiating devices shall be an approved
double action type.
            Reason: Helps to reduce false alarms.
      (71)   Section 907.6.1.
         907.6.1.1 Wiring Installation. All fire alarm systems shall be
installed in such a manner that a failure of any single initiating device or
single open in an initiating circuit conductor will not interfere with the
normal operation of other such devices. All signaling line circuits (SLC) shall
be installed in such a way that a single open will not interfere with the
operation of any addressable devices (Class A). Outgoing and return SLC
conductors shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 72 requirements for Class
A circuits and shall have a minimum of four feet separation horizontal and one
foot vertical between supply and return circuit conductors. The initiating
device circuit (IDC) from a signaling line circuit interface device may be
wired Class B, provided the distance from the interface device to the
initiating device is ten feet or less.
            Reason: To provide uniformity in system specifications and guidance
to design engineers. Improves reliability of fire alarm devices and systems.
      (72)   Section 907.6.3; delete all four Exceptions.
            Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency
event for all fire alarm systems. This is moved from 907.6.5.3 in the 2012 IFC
and reworded to match new code language and sections.
      (73)   Section 907.6.6; - add sentence at end of paragraph to read as
follows:
         See 907.6.3 for the required information transmitted to the
supervising station.
            Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency
event for all fire alarm systems. This is moved from 907.6.5.3 in the 2012 IFC
and reworded to match new code language and sections.
      (74)   Section 909.22.
         909.22 Stairway or Ramp Pressurization Alternative. Where the building
is equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with
Section 903.3.1.1 and the stair pressurization alternative is chosen for
compliance with Building Code requirements for a smokeproof enclosure, interior
exit stairways or ramps shall be pressurized to a minimum of 0.10 inches of
water (25 Pa) and a maximum of 0.35 inches of water (87 Pa) in the shaft
relative to the building measured with all interior exit stairway and ramp
doors closed under maximum anticipated conditions of stack effect and wind
effect. Such systems shall comply with Section 909, including the installation
of a separate fire-fighter's smoke control panel as per Section 909.16, and a
Smoke Control Permit shall be required from the fire department as per Section
105.7.
         909.22.1 Ventilating equipment. The activation of ventilating
equipment for the stair or ramp pressurization system shall be by smoke
detectors installed at each floor level at an approved location at the entrance
to the smokeproof enclosure. When the closing device for the stairway or ramp
shaft and vestibule doors is activated by smoke detection or power failure, the
mechanical equipment shall activate and operate at the required performance
levels. Smoke detectors shall be installed in accordance with Section 907.3.
         909.22.1.1 Ventilation Systems. Smokeproof enclosure ventilation
systems shall be independent of other building ventilation systems. The
equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall comply with one of
the following:
            1.   Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be
located exterior to the building and directly connected to the smokeproof
enclosure or connected to the smokeproof enclosure by ductwork enclosed by not
less than 2-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of
the Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with
Section 711 of the Building Code, or both.
            2.   Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be
located within the smokeproof enclosure with intake or exhaust directly from
and to the outside or through ductwork enclosed by not less than 2-hour
barriers constructed in
               accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal
assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or
both.
            3.   Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be
located within the building if separated from the remainder of the building,
including other mechanical equipment, by not less than 2-hour fire barriers
constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal
assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or
both.
            Exceptions:
            1.   Control wiring and power wiring utilizing a 2-hour rated cable
or cable system.
            2.   Where encased with not less than 2 inches (51 mm) of concrete.
            3.   Control wiring and power wiring protected by a listed
electrical circuit protective systems with a fire-resistance rating of not less
than 2 hours.
         909.22.1.2 Standby Power. Mechanical vestibule and stairway and ramp
shaft ventilation systems and automatic fire detection systems shall be
provided with standby power in accordance with Section 2702 of the Building
Code.
         909.22.1.3 Acceptance and Testing. Before the mechanical equipment is
approved, the system shall be tested in the presence of the fire code official
to confirm that the system is operating in compliance with these requirements.
            Reason: To assist with enforcement of such as a smoke control
system, as per Section 909.6.3, especially since a permit is now specifically
required for such systems in the Fire Code. Also ensures that a firefighter's
override panel is provided as per 909.16 for such systems. The above amendment
copies the applicable requirements for such systems from Section 909.20 of the
Building Code into the Fire Code. Although the published code did copy the
elevator pressurization requirements into the Fire Code, it did not copy over
the stair pressurization requirements.
      (75)   Section 910.2; change Exception 2. and 3.to read as follows:
         2.   Only manual smoke and heat removal shall be required in areas of
buildings equipped with early suppression fast-response (ESFR) sprinklers.
Automatic smoke and heat removal is prohibited.
         3.   Only manual smoke and heat removal shall [not] be required in
areas of buildings equipped with control mode special application sprinklers
with a response time index of 50(m*S)½ or less that are listed to control a
fire in stored commodities with 12 or fewer sprinklers. Automatic smoke and
heat removal is prohibited.
               Reason: Allows the fire department to control the smoke and heat
during and after a fire event, while still prohibiting such systems from being
automatically activated, which is a potential detriment to the particular
sprinkler systems indicated.
      (76)   Section 910.2; add subsections 910.2.3.
         910.2.3 Group H. Buildings and portions thereof used as a Group H
occupancy as follows:
            1.   In occupancies classified as Group H-2 or H-3, any of which
are more than 15,000 square feet in single floor area.
               Exception: Buildings of noncombustible construction containing
only noncombustible materials.
            2.   In areas of buildings in Group H used for storing Class 2, 3,
and 4 liquid and solid oxidizers, Class 1 and unclassified detonable organic
peroxides, Class 3 and 4 unstable (reactive) materials, or Class 2 or 3 water-
reactive materials as required for a high-hazard commodity classification.
               Exception: Buildings of noncombustible construction containing
only noncombustible materials.
                  Reason: Maintains a fire protection device utilized in such
occupancies where it is sometimes necessary to allow chemicals to burn out,
rather than extinguish.
      (77)   Section 910.3.
         910.3.4 Vent Operation. Smoke and heat vents shall be capable of being
operated by approved automatic and manual means. Automatic operation of smoke
and heat vents shall conform to the provisions of Sections 910.3.2.1 through
910.3.2.3.
         910.3.4.1 Sprinklered buildings. Where installed in buildings equipped
with an approved automatic sprinkler system, smoke and heat vents shall be
designed to operate automatically.
         The automatic operating mechanism of the smoke and heat vents shall
operate at a temperature rating at least 100 degrees F (approximately 38
degrees Celsius) greater than the temperature rating of the sprinklers
installed.
            Exception: Manual only systems per Section 910.2.
         910.3.4.2 Nonsprinklered Buildings. Where installed in buildings not
equipped with an approved automatic sprinkler system, smoke and heat vents
shall operate automatically by actuation of a heat-responsive device rated at
between 100°F (56°C) and 220°F (122°C) above ambient.
            Exception: Listed gravity-operated drop out vents.
               Reason: Amendment continues to keep applicable wording from
prior to the 2012 edition of the IFC. Specifically, automatic activation
criteria is no longer specifically required in the published code. Specifying a
temperature range at which smoke and heat vents should activate in sprinklered
buildings helps to ensure that the sprinkler system has an opportunity to
activate and control the fire prior to vent operation.
      (78)   Section 910.4.3.1.
         910.4.3.1 Makeup Air. Makeup air openings shall be provided within 6
feet of the floor level. Operation of makeup air openings shall be automatic.
The minimum gross area of makeup air inlets shall be 8 square feet per 1,000
cubic feet per minute (0.74 m2 per 0.4719 m3/s) of smoke exhaust.
            Reason: Makeup air has been required to be automatic for several
years now in this region when mechanical smoke exhaust systems are proposed.
This allows such systems to be activated from the smoke control panel by first
responders without having to physically go around the exterior of the building
opening doors manually. Such requires a significant number of first responders
on scene to conduct this operation and significantly delays activation and/or
capability of the smoke exhaust system.
      (79)   Section 912.2; add Section 912.2.3 to read as follows:
         912.2.3 Hydrant Distance. An approved fire hydrant shall be located
within 100 feet of the fire department connection as the fire hose lays along
an unobstructed path.
            Reason: To accommodate limited hose lengths, improve response times
where the FDC is needed to achieve fire control, and improve ease of locating a
fire hydrant in those situations also. Also, consistent with NFPA 14 criteria.
      (80)   Section 913.2.1; add second paragraph and exception to read as
follows:
         When located on the ground level at an exterior wall, the fire pump
room shall be provided with an exterior fire department access door that is not
less than 3 ft. in width and 6 ft. - 8 in. in height, regardless of any
interior doors that are provided. A key box shall be provided at this door, as
required by Section 506.1.
            Exception: When it is necessary to locate the fire pump room on
other levels or not at an exterior wall, the corridor leading to the fire pump
room access from the exterior of the building shall be provided with equivalent
fire resistance as that required for the pump room, or as approved by the fire
code official. Access keys shall be provided in the key box as required by
Section 506.1.
               Reason: This requirement allows fire fighters safer access to
the fire pump room. The requirement allows access without being required to
enter the building and locate the fire pump room interior access door during a
fire event. The exception recognizes that this will not always be a feasible
design scenario for some buildings, and as such, provides an acceptable
alternative to protect the pathway to the fire pump room.
      (81)   Section 914.3.1.2.
         914.3.1.2 Water Supply to required Fire Pumps. In buildings that are
more than 120 feet (37 m) in building height, required fire pumps shall be
supplied by connections to no fewer than two water mains located in different
streets. Separate supply piping shall be provided between each connection to
the water main and the pumps. Each connection and the supply piping between the
connection and the pumps shall be sized to supply the flow and pressure
required for the pumps to operate.
            Exception: {'{'}No change to exception.{'}'}
         Reason: The 2009 edition of the IFC added this requirement based on a
need for redundancy of the water supply similar to the redundancy of the power
supply to the fire pumps required for such tall buildings, partially due to the
fact that these buildings are rarely fully evacuated in a fire event. More
commonly, the alarm activates on the floor of the event, the floor above and
the floor below. Back-up power to the fire pump becomes critical for this
reason. Certainly, the power is pointless if the water supply is impaired for
any reason, so a similar requirement is provided here for redundant water
supplies. The 2015 edition changes the requirement to only apply to very tall
buildings over 420 ft. This amendment modifies/lowers the requirement to 120
ft., based on this same height requirement for fire service access elevators.
Again, the language from the 2009 and 2012 editions of the code applied to any
high-rise building. This compromise at 120 ft. is based on the above technical
justification of defend-in-place scenarios in fire incidents in such tall
structures.
      (82)   Section 1006.2.2.7.
         1006.2.2.7 Electrical Rooms. For electrical rooms, special exiting
requirements may apply. Reference the electrical code as adopted.
            Reason: Cross reference necessary for coordination with the NEC
which has exiting requirements as well.
      (83)   Section 1009.8.
         Exceptions:
         7.   Buildings regulated under State Law and built in accordance with
State registered plans, including variances or waivers granted by the State,
shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of Section 1009 and
chapter 11.
            Reason: To accommodate buildings regulated under Texas State Law
and to be consistent with amendments in Chapter 11.
      (84)   Section 1010.1.9.5 Bolt Locks; amend exceptions 3 and 4 as
follows: ; amend exceptions 3 and 4 as follows:
         Exceptions:
         3.   Where a pair of doors serves an occupant load of less than 50
persons in a Group B, F, M or S occupancy. (Remainder unchanged)
         4.   Where a pair of doors serves a Group A, B, F, M or S occupancy
(remainder unchanged)
            Reason: Application to M occupancies reflects regional practice;
No. 4 expanded to Group A due to it being a similar scenario to other uses; No.
4 was regional practice.
      (85)   Section 1020.1 Construction; add exception 6 to read as follows:
         6.   In group B occupancies, corridor walls and ceilings need not be
of fire-resistive construction within a single tenant space when the space is
equipped with approved automatic smoke-detection within the corridor. The
actuation of any detector must activate self-annunciating alarms audible in all
areas within the corridor. Smoke detectors must be connected to an approved
automatic fire alarm system where such system is provided.
               Reason: Regionally accepted alternate method. 
      (86)   Section 1029.1.1.1 Spaces under grandstands and bleachers; delete
this section.
            Reason: Unenforceable.
      (87)   Section 1031.2; change to read as follows:
         1031.2 Reliability. Required exit accesses, exits, and exit discharges
shall be continuously maintained free from obstructions or impediments to full
instant use in the case of fire or other emergency. An exit or exit passageway
shall not be used for any purpose that interferes with a means of egress.
            Reason: Maintain legacy levels of protection and long-standing
regional practice, and provide firefighter safety.

         Provide emergency signage as required by Section 606.3.
            Reason: Coordinates requirements of previous amendment.
      (89)   Section 1103.5.1: add sentence to read as follows:
         Fire sprinkler system installation shall be completed within 24 months
from date of notification by the fire code official.
            Reason: Regional consistency of this retroactive requirement to
allow business owners adequate time to budget to accommodate the cost of the
fire sprinkler system.
      (90)   Section 1103.5.
         1103.5.5 Spray Booths and Rooms. Existing spray booths and spray rooms
shall be protected by an approved automatic fire-extinguishing system in
accordance with Section 2404.
            Reason: Consistent with amendment to IFC 2404, and long-standing
regional requirement to protect this hazardous operation.
      (91)   Section 1103.7; add Section 1103.7.7 and 1103.7.7.1 to read as
follows:
         1103.7.7 Fire Alarm System Design Standards. Where an existing fire
alarm system is upgraded or replaced, the devices shall be addressable. Fire
alarm systems utilizing more than 20 smoke and/or heat detectors shall have
analog initiating devices.
            Exception: Existing systems need not comply unless the total
building, or fire alarm system, remodel or expansion exceeds 30% of the
building. When cumulative building, or fire alarm system, remodel or expansion
initiated after the date of original fire alarm panel installation exceeds 50%
of the building, or fire alarm system, the fire alarm system must comply within
18 months of permit application.
         1103.7.7.1 Communication requirements. Refer to Section 907.6.6 for
applicable requirements.
            Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency
event and provide clarity as to percentages of work that results in a
requirement to upgrade the entire fire alarm system.
      (92)   Section 1203; change and add to read as follows:
         1203.1.1 {'{'}No change.{'}'}
         1203.1.2 {'{'}No change.{'}'}
         1203.1.3 Emergency power systems and standby power systems shall be

         1203.2.26 Means of Egress Illumination in Existing Buildings.
Emergency power shall be provided for means of egress illumination in
accordance with Section 1104.5 when required by the fire code official. (90
minutes in I-2, 60 minutes elsewhere.)
         1203.3 through 1203.6 {'{'}No change.{'}'}
         1203.7 Energy Time Duration. Unless a time limit is specified by the
fire code official, in this chapter or elsewhere in this code, or in any other
referenced code or standard, the emergency and standby power system shall be
supplied with enough fuel or energy storage capacity for not less than 2-hour
full-demand operation of the system.
            Exception: Where the system is supplied with natural gas from a
utility provider and is approved.
               Reason: These amendments were moved from Chapter 6, due to
relocation of the published sections to this new Chapter 12. These provisions
provide a list to complete and match that throughout the codes. The only
additional requirements are the reference to COPS in NFPA 70, and the specified
Energy time duration. Other changes are a reference to a code provision that
already exists.
      (93)   Section 2304.1.
         2304.1 Supervision of Dispensing. The dispensing of fuel at motor
fuel-dispensing facilities shall be in accordance with the following:
            1.   Conducted by a qualified attendant; and/or,
            2.   Shall be under the supervision of a qualified attendant; and/
or
            3.   Shall be an unattended self-service facility in accordance
with Section 2304.3.
         At any time the qualified attendant of item Number 1 or 2 above is not
present, such operations shall be considered as an unattended self-service
facility and shall also comply with Section 2304.3.
            Reason: Allows a facility to apply the attended and unattended
requirements of the code when both are potentially applicable.
      (94)   Section 2401.2; delete this section.
            Reason: This section eliminates such booths from all compliance
with Chapter 15 including, but not limited to: size, ventilation, fire
protection, construction, etc. If the product utilized is changed to a more
flammable substance, the lack of compliance with Chapter 15 could result in
significant fire or deflagration and subsequent life safety hazard.
      (95)   Section 3103.3.1; delete this section.
            Reason: This new section of the Fire Code requires afire sprinkler
system to be installed in temporary tents and membrane structures, which is not
a reasonable or enforceable requirement for a temporary use. A fire watch or
fire alarm system is a more advisable approach for such occupancies that are
only temporary.
      (96)   Table 3206.2, footnote; change text to read as follows:
         h. Where storage areas are protected by either early suppression fast
response (ESFR) sprinkler systems or control mode special application
sprinklers with a response time index of 50 (m • s) ½ or less that are listed
to control a fire in the stored commodities with 12 or fewer sprinklers,
installed in accordance with NFPA 13, manual smoke and heat vents or manually
activated engineered mechanical smoke exhaust systems shall be required within
these areas.
            Reason: Allows the fire department to control the smoke and heat
during and after a fire event, while ensuring proper operation of the sprinkler
protection provided. Also, gives an alternative to smoke and heat vents.
      (97)   Table 3206.2, footnote j; add footnote j to row titled 'High
Hazard' and 'Greater than 300,000' to read as follows:
         j. High hazard high-piled storage areas shall not exceed 500,000
square feet. A 2-hour fire wall constructed in accordance with Section 706 of
the International Building Code shall be used to divide high-piled storage
exceeding 500,000 square feet in area.
            Reason: This is a long-standing legacy requirement and provides
passive protection for extremely large buildings where it would be otherwise
impossible to control the spread of fire without the fire wall in place in an
uncontrolled fire event, which is much more likely in high hazard commodities,
such as tires, flammable liquids, expanded plastics, etc.
      (98)   Section 3310.1; add sentence to end of paragraph to read as
follows:
         When fire apparatus access roads are required to be installed for any
structure or development, they shall be approved prior to the time at which
construction has progressed beyond completion of the foundation of any
structure.
            Reason: Reference requirement of Section 501.4.
      (99)   Section 5601.1.3; change to read as follows:
         5601.1.3 Fireworks. The possession, manufacture, storage, sale,
handling, and use of fireworks are prohibited.
            Exceptions:
               1.   Only when approved for fireworks displays, storage, and
handling of fireworks as allowed in Section 5604 and 5608.
               2.   The use of fireworks for approved fireworks displays as
allowed in Section 5608.
               {'{'}Delete remainder of text.)
               Reason: Restricts fireworks to approved displays only, which is
consistent with regional practice. Such is intended to help protect property
owners and individuals from unintentional fireworks fires within the
jurisdiction, as well as to help protect individuals from fireworks injuries.
It is noted that there has been a change in the State Law to allow possession
of unopened fireworks in certain areas of the vehicle, and it is highly
recommended that AH]'s familiarize themselves with the applicable State Laws in
this regard.
      (100)   Section 5703.6; add a sentence to read as follows:
         5703.6 Piping Systems. Piping systems, and their component parts, for
flammable and combustible liquids shall be in accordance with Sections 5703.6.1
through 5703.6.11. An approved method of secondary containment shall be
provided for underground tank and piping systems.
            Reason: Increased protection in response to underground leak
problems and remediation difficulty in underground applications. Coordinates
with TCEQ requirements.
      (101)   Section 5704.2.11.4; add a sentence to read as follows:
         5704.2.11.4 Leak Prevention. Leak prevention for underground tanks
shall comply with Sections 5704.2.11.4.1 through 5704.2.11.4.3. An approved
method of secondary containment shall be provided for underground tank and
piping systems.
            Reason: Increased protection in response to underground leak
problems and remediation difficulty in underground applications.
      (102)   Section 5704.2.11.4.2.
         5704.2.11.4.2 Leak Detection. Underground storage tank systems shall
be provided with an approved method of leak detection from any component of the
system that is designed and installed in accordance with NFPA 30 and as
specified in Section 5704.2.11.4.3.
            Reason: Reference to IFC Section 5704.2.11.4.3 amendment.
      (103)   Section 5704.2.11.4.3; add Section 5704.2.11.4.3 to read as
follows:
         5704.2.11.4.3 Observation Wells. Approved sampling tubes of a minimum
4 inches in diameter shall be installed in the backfill material of each
underground flammable or combustible liquid storage tank. The tubes shall
extend from a point 12 inches below the average grade of the excavation to
ground level and shall be provided with suitable surface access caps. Each tank
site shall provide a sampling tube at the corners of the excavation with a
minimum of 4 tubes. Sampling tubes shall be placed in the product line
excavation within 10 feet of the tank excavation and one every 50 feet routed
along product lines towards the dispensers, a minimum of two are required.
            Reason: Provides an economical means of checking potential leaks at
each tank site.
      (104)   Section 5707.4; add paragraph to read as follows:
         Mobile fueling sites shall be restricted to commercial, industrial,
governmental, or manufacturing, where the parking area having such operations
is primarily intended for employee vehicles. Mobile fueling shall be conducted
for fleet fueling or employee vehicles only, not the general public. Commercial
sites shall be restricted to office-type or similar occupancies that are not
primarily intended for use by the public.
            Reason: The general public does not expect a hazardous operation to
be occurring in a typical parking lot or for a fuel truck to be traversing such
parking lot, temporarily fueling a vehicle, and moving on to the next area in
the parking lot to fuel the next vehicle. Vehicular accidents occur in parking
lots on a regular basis, but the presence of a fuel truck, especially one in
the process of fueling a vehicle with gasoline, greatly adds to the potential
risk involved in such accidents. By restricting such operations to the
occupancies in question, the employees of the business may be adequately
notified to expect such operations to occur in the parking lot.
      (105)   Section 6103.2.1.
         6103.2.1.8 Jewelry Repair, Dental Labs and Similar Occupancies. Where
natural gas service is not available, portable LP-Gas containers are allowed to
be used to supply approved torch assemblies or similar appliances. Such
containers shall not exceed 20-pound (9.0 kg) water capacity. Aggregate
capacity shall not exceed 60-pound (27.2 kg) water capacity. Each device shall
be separated from other containers by a distance of not less than 20 feet.
            Reason: To provide a consistent and reasonable means of regulating
the use of portable LP-Gas containers in these situations. Reduces the hazard
presented by portable containers when natural gas is already available. Please
note that current
             State law does not allow for the enforcement of any rules more
stringent than that adopted by the State, so this amendment is only applicable
as to the extent allowed by that State law.
      (106)   Section 6104.2, Exception; add an exception 2 to read as follows:
         Exceptions:
            l.    {'{'}existing text unchanged{'}'}
            2.   Except as permitted in Sections 308 and 6104.3.2, LP-gas
containers are not permitted in residential areas.
            Reason: To provide a consistent and reasonable means of regulating
the use LP-Gas containers. Reduces the hazard presented by such containers when
natural gas is already available. References regional amendment to IFC
6104.3.2. Please note that current State law does not allow for the enforcement
of any rules more stringent than that adopted by the State, so this amendment
is only applicable as to the extent allowed by that State law.
      (107)   Section 6104.3.
         6104.3.3 Spas, Pool Heaters, and Other Listed Devices. Where natural
gas service is not available, an LP-gas container is allowed to be used to
supply spa and pool heaters or other listed devices. Such container shall not
exceed 250-gallon water capacity per lot. See Table 6104.3 for location of
containers.
            Exception: Lots where LP-gas can be off-loaded wholly on the
property where the tank is located may install up to 500 gallon above ground or
1,000 gallon underground approved containers.
               Reason: Allows for an alternate fuel source. Dwelling density
must be considered and possibly factored into zoning restrictions. Reduces the
hazard presented by over-sized LP-Gas containers. Please note that current
State Law does not allow for the enforcement of any rules more stringent than
that adopted by the State, so this amendment is only applicable as to the
extent allowed by that State Law.
      (108)   Section 6107.4 and 6109.13.
         6107.4 Protecting Containers from Vehicles. Where exposed to vehicular
damage due to proximity to alleys, driveways or parking areas, LP-gas
containers, regulators and piping shall be protected in accordance with Section
312.
         6109.13 Protection of Containers. LP-gas containers shall be stored
within a suitable enclosure or otherwise protected against tampering. Vehicle
impact protection shall be provided as required by Section 6107.4.
            Reason: NFPA 58 does not provide substantial physical protection
[it allows raised sidewalks, fencing, ditches, parking bumpers as 'vehicle
barrier protection’] of the container(s) from vehicular impact as is required
and has been required historically, as per Section 312, i.e. bollard
protection. Further, the exception to Section 6109.13 would allow for portable
containers in ventilated metal cabinets to not require any physical protection
whatsoever from vehicular impact, regardless of the location of the containers.
Please note that current State Law does not allow for the enforcement of any
rules more stringent than that adopted by the State, so this amendment is only
applicable as to the extent allowed by that State Law.
         {'{'}Applicable to those jurisdictions adopting Appendix B{'}'}
      (109)   Table B105.2; change footnote a. to read as follows:
         a.   The reduced fire-flow shall be not less than 1,000 gallons per
minute.
            Reason: The minimum fire-flow of 1,500 gpm for other than one- and
two- family dwellings has existed since the 2000 edition of the IFC, as well as
the Uniform Fire Code before that. Little to no technical justification was
provided for the proposed code change at the code hearings. The board believes
that the already-allowed 75 percent reduction in required fire-flow for the
provision of sprinkler protection is already a significant trade-off. The
minimum 1,500 gpm is not believed to be overly stringent for the vast majority
of public water works systems in this region, especially since it has existed
as the requirement for so many years. Further, the continued progression of
trading off more and more requirements in the codes for the provision of
sprinkler protection has made these systems extremely operation-critical to the
safety of the occupants and properties in question. In other words, should the
sprinkler system fail for any reason, the fire-flow requirements drastically
increase from that anticipated with a sprinkler-controlled fire scenario.

(Ord. 238, passed 1-15-1990) Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.057 PERMIT APPROVAL; FEES.
   (A)   The approval of moving permits for commercial buildings by the Mayor
or the city’s Board of Adjustments and Appeals, as the case may be pursuant to
§
150.056 of this code, may be denied if, in the opinion of Mayor or the Board,
the building, its proposed location, or its use is inconsistent with applicable

(Ord. O-24-1010, passed 8-20-2024)
LANDSCAPING
§ 150.085 LANDSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS ON NEW COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to establish certain
regulations pertaining to landscaping within the city. These regulations
provide standards and criteria for new landscaping which are intended to
promote the value of property, enhance the welfare, and improve the physical
appearance of the city.
   (B)   Scope. The standards and criteria contained within this section are
deemed to be minimum standards and shall apply to all new construction
occurring within the city, except that single-family detached dwellings shall
be exempt since such uses rarely fail to comply with the requirements set forth
in this section.
   (C)   Enforcement. The provisions of this section shall be administered and
enforced by the Building Official or his or her designee. If, at any time after
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the approved landscaping is found
to be in nonconformance to the standards and criteria of this section, the
Building Official shall issue notice to the owner, citing the violation and
describing what action is required to comply with this section. The owner,
tenant, or agent shall have 30 days from the date of the notice to restore the
landscaping as required. If the landscaping is not restored within the allotted
time, that person shall be in violation of this section.
   (D)   Permits. No permits shall be issued for building, paving, grading or
construction until a landscape plan is submitted and approved by the Building
Official. In the event that the proposed development requires an approved
subdivision plat, site plan, or master development plan, no final approval
shall be granted unless a landscape plan is submitted and approved. Prior to
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building or structure, all
screening and landscaping shall be in place in accordance with the landscape
plan required in division (E) of this section. In any case in which an
occupancy certificate is sought at a season of the year in which the Building
Official determines that it would be impractical to plant trees, shrubs or
grass, or to lay turf, an occupancy certificate may be issued notwithstanding
the fact that the landscaping required by the landscape plan has not been
completed, provided the applicant posts a letter of credit or deposits cash in
an escrow account in the amount of the estimated cost of the landscaping. The
letter of credit or escrow deposit shall be conditioned upon the installation
of all landscaping required by the landscaping plan within 6 months of the date
of the application and shall give the city the right to draw upon the letter of
credit or escrow deposit to complete the landscaping if the applicant fails to
do so.
   (E)   Landscape plans. Prior to the issuance of a building, paving, grading
or construction permit for any use other than single-family dwellings, a
landscape plan shall be submitted to the Building Official. The Building
Official, or his or her designee, shall review the plans and shall approve
same, if the plans are in accordance with the criteria of these regulations. If
the plans are not in accord, they shall be disapproved and shall be accompanied
by a written statement setting forth the changes necessary for compliance. A
landscape architect, landscape contractor, or landscape designer, knowledgeable
in plants, materials and landscape design, shall prepare landscaping plans.
Landscape plans shall contain the following information:
      (1)   Minimum scale of 1 inch equals 50 feet;
      (2)   Location of all trees to be preserved;
      (3)   Location of all plant and landscaping material to be used including
plants, paving benches, screens, fountains, statues, or other landscape
features;
      (4)   Species of all plant material to be used;
      (5)   Size of all plant material to be used;
      (6)   Spacing of plant material where appropriate;
      (7)   Layout and description of irrigations, sprinkler or water systems,
including placement of water sources;
      (8)   Description of maintenance provisions for the landscape plan; and
      (9)   Person(s) responsible for the preparation of landscape plan.
   (F)   Maintenance. The owner, tenant and their agent, if any, shall be
jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. All
required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all
times. This shall include mowing, edging, pruning, fertilizing, watering,
weeding, and other activities common to the maintenance of landscaping.
Landscaped areas shall be kept free of trash, litter, weeds and other material
or plants not a part of the landscaping. All plant materials shall be
maintained in a healthy and growing condition as is appropriate for the season
of the year. Plant materials which die shall be replaced with plant material of
similar variety and size.
   (G)   General standards. The following criteria and standards shall apply to
landscape materials and installation.
      (1)   Quality. Plant materials used in conformance with the provisions of
this section shall conform to the standards of the American Standard for
Nursery Stock, or equal thereto. Grass seed, sod and other material shall be
clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pests and insects.
      (2)   Trees. Trees referred to in this section shall be of a species
common to this area of Texas and shall have an average spread of crown of
greater than 15 feet at maturity. Trees having a lesser average mature crown of
15 feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent
of a 15 feet crown of spread. Trees shall be of a minimum of 3 caliper inches
when measured 6 inches above ground, and shall be selected from the list of
approved trees, maintained by the Building Official.
      (3)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs shall be a minimum of 2 feet in height
when measured immediately after planting. Hedges, where installed, shall be
planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual
screen, which will be 3 feet high within 1 year after time of planting.
      (4)   Vines. Vines shall be a minimum of 2 feet in height immediately
after planting and may be used in conjunction with fences, screens, or walls to
meet screening requirements as specified.
      (5)   Ground cover. Ground covers used in lieu of grass in whole and in
part shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and
reasonably complete coverage within 1 year of planting.
      (6)   Lawn grass. Grass areas may be solid sod, plugged, sprigged or
seeded except that solid sod shall be used in swales, berms or other areas
subject to erosion.
      (7)   Credit for existing trees. Any trees preserved on a site meeting
the specifications herein shall be credited toward meeting the tree requirement
of any landscape of any landscaping provision of this section. Trees of
exceptional quality due to size, large canopy cover, trunk diameter, rareness,
age or species may, at the discretion of the Building Official, be credited as
2 trees for the minimum requirements herein.
   (H)   Minimum requirements for off-street parking and vehicular use areas.
Parking lots, vehicular use areas and parked vehicles are to be effectively
screened from the public view and adjacent property. Both the interior and
perimeter of such areas shall be landscaped in accordance to the following
criteria. Areas used for parking or vehicular storage, which are under, on, or
within buildings are exempt from these standards.
      (1)   Interior landscaping. A minimum of 10% of the gross parking areas
shall be devoted to living landscaping which includes grass, ground cover,
plants, shrubs and trees. Gross parking area is to be measured from the edge of
the parking and/or driveway paving and sidewalks. The following additional
criteria shall apply to the interior of parking lots:
         (a)   Interior landscape areas shall be protected from vehicular
encroachment of overhang through appropriate wheel stops or curbs.
         (b)   There shall be a minimum of 1 tree planted for each 400 square
feet or fraction thereof of required interior landscape area.
         (c)   Interior areas of parking lots shall contain planting islands
located so as to best relieve the expanse of paving. Planter islands most be
located no further apart than every 12 parking spaces and at the terminus of
all rows of parking. These islands shall contain at least 1 tree. Planter
islands shall not be required for lots containing less than 35,000 square feet.
The remainder shall be landscaped with shrubs, lawn, ground cover and other
appropriate material not to exceed 3 feet in height. Interior planting islands
shall have a minimum size of 9 by 18 feet.
         (d)   The Building Official may approve planter islands required by
this section to be located further apart than 12 parking spaces in order to
preserve existing trees in interior parking areas. Off-street parking and drive
areas located within the drip line of a tree shall be paved with permeable
material approved by the Director of Development Services when the drip line of
an existing tree is larger than planter islands required by this section.
      (2)   Perimeter landscaping. All parking lots and vehicular use areas
shall be screened from all abutting properties and/or public rights-of-way with
a wall, fence, hedge, berm or other durable landscape barrier. Any living
barrier shall be established in a 2-foot minimum width planting strip. Plants
and materials used in living barriers shall be at least 30 inches high at the
time of planting and shall be of a type and species that will attain a minimum
height of 3 feet 1 year after planting. Any landscape barrier not containing
live plants or trees shall be a minimum of 3 feet high at the time of
installation. Perimeter landscaping shall be designed to screen off-street
parking lots and other vehicular use areas from public rights-of-way and
adjacent properties.
         (a)   Whenever an off-street parking or vehicular use area abuts a
public right-of-way, except a public alley, a perimeter landscape area of at
least 15 feet in depth shall be maintained between the abutting right-of-way
and the off-street parking or vehicular use area. An appropriate landscape
screen or barrier shall be installed in this area and the remaining area shall
be landscaped with at least grass or other ground cover. Necessary access ways
from the public right-of-way shall be permitted through all such landscaping.
The maximum width for access ways shall be 50 feet for nonresidential 2-way
movements, 30 feet for residential 2-way movements, 20 feet for nonresidential
1-way movements.
         (b)   Whenever an off-street parking or vehicular use area abuts an
adjacent property line, a perimeter landscape area of at least 10 feet in width
shall be maintained between the edge of the parking area and the adjacent
property line. Access ways between lots may be permitted through all perimeter
landscape areas. Maximum width for access ways shall be 25 feet. Landscaping
shall be designed to visually screen the parking area. Whenever such property
is zoned or used for residential purposes, the landscape buffer shall include a
wall, hedge, or berm not greater than 8 feet in height nor less than 3 feet in
height.
         (c)   Perimeter landscape areas shall contain at least 1 tree for each
50 lineal feet or fraction thereof of perimeter area.
   (I)   Landscaping requirements for non-vehicular open space. In addition to
the landscaping of off-street parking and vehicular use areas, all remaining
open spaces on any developed lot or parcel shall conform to the following
minimum requirements:
      (1)   Grass, ground cover, shrubs and other landscape materials shall be
used to cover all open ground within 20 feet of any building or paving or other
use such as storage.
      (2)   All structures shall be treated with landscaping so as to enhance
the appearance of the structure and to screen any detractive or unsightly
appearance.
      (3)   Landscaping shall be provided on each developed lot in accordance
with the following standards:
         (a)   In all residential zoning districts (except R-20, R-12.5 and R-
7.5), a minimum of 15% of the landscaping shall be located in the required
front yard.
         (b)   In all nonresidential zoning districts, a minimum of 15% of the
total site area shall be devoted to feature landscaping with not less than 50%
of the landscaping being located in the required front yard.
      (4)   Trees shall be planted in non-vehicular open space to meet the
following requirements. Existing trees that are preserved on a developed site
may be credited to the following requirements:
 
Percentage of Site in Vehicular Open Tree Ratio per Non-Vehicular Open Space
Space
Less than 30                         1 tree/2,500 square feet
30 – 49                            1 tree/3,000 square feet
Over 50                              1 tree/4,000 square feet
 
      (5)   Landscaping in excess of the required minimum open space that is
located in the rear yard of the site shall not be used to meet the minimum open
space requirements for the site.
   (J)   Sight distance and visibility. Rigid compliance with these landscaping
requirements shall not be such as to cause visibility obstructions and/or blind
corners at intersections. Whenever an access way intersects a public right-of-
way or when the subject property abuts the intersection of 2 or more public
rights-of-way, a triangular visibility area, as described below, shall be
created. Landscaping within the triangular visibility area shall be designed to
provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between 3 and 6 feet. Trees
may be permitted in this area provided they are trimmed in such a manner that
no limbs or foliage extend into the cross-visibility area. The triangular areas
are:
      (1)   The areas of property on both sides of the intersection of an
access way and a public right-of-way shall have a triangular visibility area
with 2 sides of each triangle being 10 feet in length from the point of the
intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other 2
sides.
      (2)   The areas of property located at a corner formed by the
intersection of 2 or more public rights-of-way shall have a triangular
visibility area with 2 sides of each triangle being 20 feet in length from the
point of the intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends
of the other 2 sides. Landscaping, except required grass and low ground cover,
shall not be located closer than 3 feet from the edge of any access way
pavement. In the event other visibility obstructions are apparent in the
proposed landscape plan, as determined by the Director, the requirements set
forth herein may be reduced to the extent to remove the conflict.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The State Legislature has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Tex. Water
Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City
Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. O-13-753, passed 4-15-2013)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city may be subject to periodic
inundation which might result in loss of life or property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. O-13-753, passed 4-15-2013)
§ 153.03 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. O-13-753, passed 4-15-2013)
§ 153.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may

forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, provided the relevant factors in §
153.27(B) of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter, as in §
153.03.
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use, provided:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in divisions (A) through (J) above are met;
and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the city’s FIRM on sites (i) outside
of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home
park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a
result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30,
AH and AE on the city’s FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this

§ 153.42 SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS; STANDARDS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with §§
153.02 through
153.04 of this chapter.
   (B)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain
development permit requirements of §§

153.45
§ 153.43 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
153.07 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where
velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or
sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the
base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the
depth number specified in feet on the city’s FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth
number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the
base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the
depth number specified in feet on the city’s FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth
number is specified); or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the BFE in
an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of
buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
153.27 are satisfied.
   (D)   Require within Zones AH and AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
(Ord. O-13-753, passed 4-15-2013) Penalty, see §
153.45
§ 153.44 FLOODWAYS.
   Areas located within special flood hazards established in §
153.07 are designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, the city may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the city first completes all of the provisions
required by section 65.12.

§ 153.45 PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than Texas law provides for each violation, and in addition shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.
   (B)   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction in
the municipal court of the City of Ferris, Texas, shall be punished by a fine
not to exceed the sum of $2,000 for each offense. Every day a violation occurs
shall constitute a separate offense.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Title. This subchapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the
“Zoning Ordinance of the City of Ferris.”
   (B)   Interpretation of chapter. When interpreting and applying the
provisions of this chapter, such provisions shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, convenience,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare.
      (1)   Conflict with other laws. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as repealing any existing ordinance regulating nuisances or as
permitting or requiring uses that are now prohibited by law.
      (2)   District boundaries. When definite distances in feet are not shown
on the Zoning District Map, the district boundaries on the Map are intended to
be along existing streets, alleys or property lines or extensions of or from
the same. When the location of a district boundary line is not otherwise
specified, it shall be determined by scaling on the Official Zoning Map and
measuring from a given line.
      (3)   Discrepancies in map. Where the street layout on the ground varies
from the street layout as shown on the Zoning District Map, the Board of
Adjustments may apply the designations shown on the mapped streets in such a
way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the plan for the particular area
in question.
      (4)   Pre-existing legal status. No building, structure or use which was
not lawfully existing at the time of adoption of this chapter shall be, become
or be made legal solely by the adoption of this chapter.
   (C)   Severability. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City
Council of the city that the provisions of this chapter are severable. If any
court of competent jurisdiction shall judge any provision of this chapter to be
invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provision of this chapter not
specifically included in said judgment. If any court of competent jurisdiction
shall judge invalid the application of any provision of this chapter to a
particular property, building or other structure, such judgment shall not
affect the application of said provision to any other property, building or
structure not specifically included in said judgment.
   (D)   Rules for words and phrases. The zoning regulations and districts
provided herein have been established in accordance with a comprehensive plan,
for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
the citizens of the city. They have been designed to lessen congestion in the
streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide
adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks and other public requirements.
They have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, for the
character of the district and for its peculiar suitability for particular uses,
and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most
appropriate use of land throughout the city consistent with a comprehensive
plan.
      (1)   General interpretation. For the purpose of this chapter, certain
terms and words are defined and shall have the meanings ascribed in this
chapter unless it is apparent from the context that different meanings are
intended.
      (2)   Tense and number. Words used in the present tense include the
future tense; words in the singular number include the plural number, and words
in the plural number include the singular number.
      (3)   Interpretation of certain words. The word “shall” is mandatory not
directory; the word “may” is permissive; the word “person” includes a firm,
association, organization, partnership, trust, foundation, company, or
corporation as well as an individual; the word “used” means designed and
intended or arranged to be used; the word “building” includes the word
“structure;” the word “lot” includes “building lot” or “parcel.” The term
“occupied” means "occupied or intended to be occupied, or arranged or designed
for occupancy." The word “including” means “including but not limited to.”
Wherever this chapter imposes a greater restriction than imposed by other
ordinances, laws, or regulations, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.

zoned areas of the City of Ferris that are shown on the Residential Overlay
District Map below (there are areas shown that are not zoned residential and
are not impacted by this section), attached hereto and made part hereof.
      (2)   It is provided that within this area, the existing (or as then
amended) base zoning will remain in effect, and will control the use of the
property. This section does not change the use of the property, only the
structures that may be placed on it. The base zoning still applies to the
structures, except as amended by this section.
   (B)   The following is allowed on qualifying property within the Residential
Historic Overlay District:
      (1)   The maximum lot coverage is increased to allow for up to 60% lot
coverage.
      (2)   It is recognized that in this district, there are lots that are
single lots made up of smaller lots. This is commonly referred to as a lot with
internal lot lines. Property owners may ignore internal lot lines for the
purposes of construction and setbacks. Internal lot lines may be ignored and
the outermost property lines of such lots shall govern when all zoning issues
are considered.
      (3)   In the event of destruction or deterioration beyond an owners
control, structures in this overlay district may rebuild properties in the same
footprint and floor plan as previously existed, even if it is a legal
nonconforming use.
      (4)   Carports shall be allowed to be built up to the property lines, but
must be setback from the street by at least 10 feet. Carports shall not be
allowed to shed water onto adjacent properties and may not create visibility
issues for traffic, as determined by the Building Official.
      (5)   Historically appropriate fences in the front yard shall be
permissible. Historically appropriate includes the fence being no more than 3
feet tall and being a minimum of 50% open. A fence permit shall still be
required to build a new fence in this zone.
      (6)   Single family homes constructed/re-constructed in this district may
be constructed/reconstructed to match the type of construction most prevalent
in the surrounding area. This means that the masonry requirement may not be
applicable to some construction in this district. Should a question arise as to
the type of construction allowed, the Board of Adjustments shall make the final
determination.

conform to the requirements of this chapter may request that a PD District be
approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in its original form
or by subsequent amendments. However, while a PD District may be proposed to
modify certain provisions of this chapter, no proposed PD District ordinance
shall be approved without ensuring a level of exceptional quality or innovation

districts) is made of the non-residential property, an 8-foot tall opaque
screening device constructed of wood or masonry, shall be erected along the
common property line between the non-residential use and the adjoining
residentially zoned property. Insofar as it is practical, the screening device
shall be erected along the entire length of the common line between the non-
residential property and the abutting residentially zoned property.
   (B)   Multi-family. A screening device, as defined within this chapter,

following circumstances shall be found to apply:
      (1)   Any exception recommended for approval shall be subject to such
conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby recommended shall not
constitute a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other
properties in the vicinity and district in which the subject property is
situated; and

including size, shape, topography, street frontage, location or surrounding
land use; the size or height of the building on which the sign is to be

standards of this subchapter, considering adequacy, stability, strength and
safety to the public health and welfare.

carport, then the request shall be deemed to be granted without need of a
public hearing by the Board. The City Manager or his or her designated
representative shall issue to the applicant appropriate documentation showing
the grant of the special exception. Such documentation and grant may contain

chapter, including modification of the boundaries of the zoning districts.
   (B)   Recommendation of Planning and Zoning Commission. Any such proposed
amendment or modification must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for public hearing, recommendation and report, before the same is
acted on by the City Council. The Commission may undertake any such study and
public hearing on its own motion, or on request from the City Council, from any
citizen, or from any party having a proprietary interest in any affected
property.
   (C)   Public hearings and notices required.
      (1)   A public hearing shall be held by the Planning and Zoning
Commission on any proposed zoning change. Ten days’ written notice in advance
of the hearing shall be sent by ordinary mail, postage prepaid, to each
taxpayer, as shown by the last approved city tax roll, who owns real property
lying within 200 feet of the property on which the change is requested, in the
manner required by law.
      (2)   The City Manager or designee shall have at least 1 sign erected on
the property for which a zoning change has been requested. The sign shall have
total area of at least 4 square feet and shall be located adjacent to streets,
if possible. Such sign shall be erected on or before the first date of the
first notice to property owners and shall be removed immediately after final
action by the City Council, or when the applicant withdraws the request,
whichever comes first. The sign shall contain a notice of hearing on a zoning
change and the telephone number of the public official from whom dates of
public hearing may be obtained. The erection or continued maintenance of signs
shall not be deemed a condition precedent to the granting of any zoning change
recommendation or approval or the holding of any public hearing.
      (3)   A public hearing on any proposed amendment shall be held by the
City Council before its adoption. Fifteen days’ published notice in advance of
the hearing shall be given, by publication thereof in 1 issue of the official
publication of the city, in the manner required by law.
   (D)   Petition in opposition. In all zoning cases where a valid petition in
opposition to the change has been filed by the owners of 20% or more of the
land located within 200 feet of the subject property in a timely manner, and in
those cases where the requisite 75% of the Council has not approved the
proposed change, then, in each such instance, no application for a rezoning of
the same subject property to the same or a more liberal classification shall be
filed or considered within a period of 6 months from the Council’s action in
denying the original application.
   (E)   Waiting period for re-submittal of zoning request. In all other cases
where an application for rezoning has simply been denied and no petition in
opposition filed in conjunction therewith, then, in such cases, there shall be
no reapplication for the same or a more liberal zoning classification change
filed, submitted, or considered within 90 days from the date of the Council’s
action in denying the original application.
   (F)   Withdrawal of application for zoning change. In the event that an
applicant withdraws his or her application for a change in zoning on any
subject property prior to the Council’s action in either granting or denying
the same, then, in such instance, no reapplication for any zoning change shall
be made on the subject property for a period of 30 days from the date that the
applicant withdraws his or her original application. An applicant shall have
the absolute right to withdraw his or her application at any time prior to
action thereon by the Council provided he or she does so in writing. However,
in the event that at any stage of the rezoning process prior to action by the
Council thereon, when a valid petition has been filed by the owners of 20% or
more of the land within 200 feet of the subject property, then in such instance
the applicant whether such application be withdrawn or not, shall be precluded
for a period of 6 months from such withdrawal or action of denial by the
Council thereon, from reapplying for the same or a more liberal zoning
classification to that just applied for.
   (G)   Modification of zoning district boundary. All requests for amendments
to this chapter requiring modification of the boundaries of the zoning
districts shall be accompanied by a current plat of the property, verified by a
registered surveyor, which accurately depicts the property in accordance with
the City of Ferris subdivision regulations. All zoning change requests shall
also be accompanied by a current tax statement showing that there are no
outstanding taxes or liens due on the property. Prior to final approval by the
City Council, all rights-of-way and easements adjacent to and within the
boundaries of the property under consideration will be dedicated in conformance
with the standards as set forth in the City of Ferris subdivision regulations.

condition and repair all damage to public property caused by such operations
within 30 calendar days of the completion of well drilling activities or
plugging and abandonment of a well.
            2.   Cleanup after spills, leaks, and malfunctions. After any
spill, leak or malfunction, the operator shall remove or cause to be removed to
the satisfaction of the city all waste materials from any public or private
property affected by such spill, leak or malfunction. Cleanup operations must
begin immediately. If the owner fails to begin site cleanup within 24 hours,
the city shall have the right to contact the Railroad Commission in order to
facilitate the removal of all waste materials from any property affected by
such spill, leak or malfunction.
            3.   Free from debris. The property on which a well site is located
shall at all times be kept free of debris, pools of water or other liquids,
contaminated soil, weeds, brush, trash or other waste material within a radius
of 100 feet around any tanks, separators, and producing wells.
            4.   Blowouts. In the event of the loss of control of any well, the
operator shall immediately take all reasonable steps to regain control
regardless of any other provision of this chapter and shall notify the city as
soon as practicable. If the city believes that danger to persons and property
exists because of loss of well control and that the operator is not taking or
is unable to take all reasonable and necessary steps to regain control of such
well, the city may then employ any well control expert or experts or other
contractors or suppliers of special services, or may incur any other expenses
for labor and material that the city deems necessary to regain control of such
well. The city shall then have a valid lien against the interest of the well of
all working interest owners to secure payment of any expenditure made by the
city pursuant to such action of the city in gaining control of said well.

   (A)   An operator shall submit an application to the city to amend an
existing oil or gas well permit to commence drilling from a new drill site that
is not shown on (or incorporated by reference as part of) the existing permit,
to relocate a drill site or operation site that is shown on (or incorporated by
reference as part of) the existing permit, or to otherwise amend the existing
permit.
   (B)   Applications for amended oil or gas well permits shall be in writing,
shall be on forms provided by the city, shall be signed by the operator, and
shall include the following:
      (1)   The application fee as set by the city's adopted fee schedule;
      (2)   A description of the proposed amendments;
      (3)   Any changes to the information submitted with the application for
the existing oil or gas well permit (if such information has not previously
been provided to the city);
      (4)   Such additional information as is reasonably required by the city
to demonstrate compliance with the applicable development plat, applicable
conditional use permit or Planned Development Zoning District; and
      (5)   Such additional information as is reasonably required by the city
to prevent imminent destruction of property or injury to persons.
   (C)   All applications for amended oil or gas well permits shall be filed
with the City Secretary, or assigns, it shall be immediately forwarded to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for review. Incomplete applications may be
returned to the applicant, in which case the city shall provide a written
explanation of the deficiencies; however, the city may retain a processing fee
as determined by the city. The city may return any application as incomplete if
there is a dispute pending before the Railroad Commission regarding the
determination of the operator.
   (D)   If the activities proposed by the amendment are not materially
different from the activities covered by the existing oil or gas well permit,
and if the proposed activities are in conformance with the applicable
development plat or applicable conditional use permit, then the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall have the authority to approve the amendment within 10
days after the application is filed.
   (E)   If the activities proposed by the amendment are materially different
from the activities covered by the existing oil or gas well permit, and if the
proposed activities are in conformance with the applicable development plat or
the applicable conditional use permit, then the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall approve the amendment within 30 days after the application is filed. If,
however, the activities proposed by the amendment are materially different and,
in the judgment of the Planning and Zoning Commission, might create a risk of
imminent destruction of property or injury to persons that was not associated
with the activities covered by the existing permit or that was not otherwise
taken into consideration by the existing permit, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may require the amendment to be processed as a new oil or gas well
permit application.
   (F)   The failure of the Planning and Zoning Commission to review and issue
an amended oil or gas well permit within a reasonable specified time limit
shall not cause the application for the amended permit to be deemed approved.
   (G)   The decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission to deny an
amendment to an oil or gas well permit shall be provided to the operator in
writing within 10 days after the decision, including an explanation of the
basis for the decision. The operator may appeal any such denial to the City
Council.
(Ord. 618, passed 3-20-2006)
§ 155.15 TRANSFER OF OIL OR GAS WELL PERMITS.
   An oil or gas well permit may be transferred by the operator without the
consent of the City Council if the transfer is in writing signed by both
parties, if the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of
the transferred permit, if all information previously provided to the city as
part of the application for the transferred permit is updated to reflect any
changes, if the transferee provides the insurance and security required by this
chapter. The insurance and security provided by the transferor shall be
released if a copy of the written transfer is provided to the city. The
transfer shall not relieve the transferor from any liability to the city
arising out of any activities conducted prior to the transfer.
(Ord. 618, passed 3-20-2006)
§ 155.16 REMEDIES OF THE CITY.
   (A)   If an operator (or its officers, employees, agents, contractors,
subcontractors or representatives) fails to comply with any requirement of a
oil or gas well permit (including any requirement incorporated by reference as
part of the permit), the City Secretary shall give written notice to the
operator specifying the nature of the alleged failure and giving the operator a
reasonable time to cure, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the
alleged failure, the extent of the efforts required to cure, and the potential
impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the community. In no event,
however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the alleged failure
presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or
unless the alleged failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic
reports. The city may issue a stop work order under the Fire Code.
   (B)   If the operator does not cure the alleged failure within the time
specified by the city, the city may notify the Railroad Commission and request
that the Railroad Commission take appropriate action (with a copy of such
notice provided to the operator), and the city may pursue any other remedy
available under this chapter.
   (C)   If the operator does not cure the alleged failure within the time
specified by the city, the city may upon recommendation of the City Engineer:
      (1)   Recommend to the City Council that the oil or gas well permit be
suspended until the alleged failure is cured; or,
      (2)   If the operator fails to initiate and diligently pursue a cure,
recommend to the City Council that the oil or gas well permit be revoked.
   (D)   The decision of the city to recommend suspension or revocation of an
oil or gas well permit shall be provided to the operator in writing at least 10
days before any action by the City Council.
   (E)   If an oil or gas well permit is revoked, the operator may submit an
application for a new oil or gas well permit for the same well.
(Ord. 618, passed 3-20-2006)
§ 155.17 ENFORCEMENT; RIGHT OF ENTRY.

(Ord. 618, passed 3-20-2006)
§ 155.99 PENALTY.

well permit issued under this chapter;
      (2)   Fail to comply with any conditions set forth in an oil or gas well
permit issued under this chapter; or
      (3)   Violate any provision or requirement set forth under this chapter.
   (B)   Any violation of this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not more
than $2,000 per day, subject to applicable state law. Each day a violation
occurs constitutes a separate violation.
