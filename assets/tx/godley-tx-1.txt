roadway and partly on an unimproved surface shall not prevent the safe travel
of motorists on said street (i.e. blocking the view of a traffic control device
such as stop sign, yield sign, etc., preventing a motorist from viewing
oncoming traffic in all directions of an intersection, etc.). To comply with
this exception, parking partly on a roadway and partly on an unimproved surface

rights in the animal.

the owner to claim the animal have failed. Once an animal is deemed abandoned,
the previous owner's ownership is extinguished and transfers to the city. This
transfer expressly divests the previous owner of any of the property rights in
the animal. The city shall work to prevent the euthanasia of abandoned animals
through reaching out to animal rescue groups, the humane society, veterinarians
and other groups to find suitable temporary or permanent homes for the animal.

Director of Public Works. If the applicant elects to do so, he or she may make
a cash deposit in such sum as may be fixed by the Director of Public Works in
lieu of written bond. Provided, however, if the person making the application
for permit is a provider of public utility service, holding a valid franchise
from the city, the utility may make a blanket bond in the amount of $1,000
payable to the city, and the requirement of a new bond for each site of
excavation or opening in a street or road shall be waived with respect to the
provider of utility service until such time as the estimated cost to repair all
excavations open or unrepaired by the utility exceeds the amount of the bond.
   (C)   Issuance. When the bond or deposit required in division (B) above
shall have been accepted by the Director of Public Works, he or she shall then
issue a permit for the excavation or opening named in the application, and the
applicant may then proceed with the work in the exact location designated in
his or her application and in no other space.
   (D)   Protection of the public. It shall be the duty of any person making an
excavation in any street in the city to adequately and sufficiently protect all
excavations by barricades or other obstructions, including but not less than
one light or reflectorized barricade on each side of the excavation during the
nighttime so as to prevent accidents or injuries to personal property, until
such time as the excavation is resurfaced and approved by the Director of
Public Works. The city may, but is not obligated to, erect the barricades,
provide the lights, and do other things necessary to properly warn the public.
Any work done by the city or expenses incurred by the city in the protection of
the public, which results because of a failure of the person opening the
excavation, shall be charged to the person and collectible against the bond
posted.
   (E)   Supervision of the work. All of the work of excavation or making any
character of opening in any of the streets, alleys or highways of the city,
shall, at all times, be under the supervision of the Director of Public Works,
and the person or persons doing the work shall do the same in a manner directed
by the Director of Public Works, to the end that the streets and highways of
the city shall not be unduly disturbed or traffic thereon obstructed.
   (F)   Completion of work. After the excavation or opening shall have been
made, the person so making it shall backfill the excavation or opening with the
material and in such manner, including but not limited to, tamping, packing or
rolling, as the Director of Public Works may require, and shall leave the
street or highway in at least the same condition as it was before the opening
was made.
   (G)   Inspection of the work. The conditions of the bond required in
division (B) above shall not be considered to have been complied with until the
Director of Public Works has inspected the street or highway and determined
same to be in satisfactory condition. In the event that the person making the
opening shall fail to leave the highway in a good state of repair, satisfactory
to the Director of Public Works, the Director of Public Works shall call upon
the bondsperson to pay the cost of repairing the highway; provided, however,
that in the event of a cash deposit instead of a bond, the Director of Public
Works may proceed to have the street or other property put in good condition,
paying for the same out of the deposit made by the person; and, if there be any
remainder of the deposit after payment for the work, the remainder shall be
refunded to the person making the deposit.
   (H)   Time limit. Unless otherwise specified by the Director of Public
Works, with the approval of the City Council, permit issued hereunder shall be
valid for a period of 30 days. If at the end of this 30-day period the work for
which the excavation or opening was made cannot be reasonably completed, the
person holding the permit shall advise the Director of Public Works in writing
of the additional time necessary and a date for completion. The Director of
Public Works may extend the permit period for 15 days in his or her own
discretion. If a permit period in excess of 15 additional days is required to
complete the work, the Director of Public Works may extend the period only with
the approval of the City Council. Failure to close and fully repair an opening
or excavation within the permit period shall constitute an offense under this
subchapter.

96.99   Penalty
§ 96.01 PURPOSE.
   The city has a duty to provide for the safety and privacy of every person
living in the city; to be secure in the confines of their home, free from
fraud, crime and/or unwanted intrusion by others with intent to do harm. This
chapter addresses this compelling and important governmental interest and
regulates all who go door-to-door to residences within the city, regardless of
reason or intent and provides for tailored safeguards to prevent harm to city
residents.
(Ord. 10-01-2019DTD, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 96.02 CURFEW.
   No residential door-to-door contacts are allowed during the hours of 9:00
p.m. and 9:00 a.m., Central Standard Time (CST). A violation of this
prohibition shall constitute a criminal offense.
(Ord. 10-01-2019DTD, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 96.03 DO NOT KNOCK REGISTRY.
   Residents who do not wish for people coming door-to-door to knock on their
door, ring their doorbell, or allow entry into their residential premises, may
register with the city their address as a "Do Not Knock" residence. The city
shall maintain a registry of all "Do Not Knock" residences and promote wide
distribution of the registry on the city's website and to any persons going
door-to-door, including any organization doing so. And, the city shall provide
signs with the message "This Home is a Do Not Knock Home - Solicitation
Prohibited Per City Ordinance" giving notice to persons going door-to-door that

the doorbell, or otherwise enters the premises (including the front yard,
driveway, front stoop, doorstep, etc.) of the residence shall be in violation
of this chapter; a criminal offense. The person may also be in offense of the
criminal trespass laws of the Texas Penal Code. Actual notice that a property
is a "Do Not Knock" residence is not a defense to a criminal prosecution for a
violation of this offense. Any group, company, or person intending to go door-
to-door in the city has a duty to get the most up-to-date registry of "Do Not
Knock" residences and to be on the lookout for "Do Not Knock" signs and to
strictly avoid the "Do Not Knock" residences in compliance with this chapter.

§ 150.22 RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY INSPECTION.
   (A)   The Administrator may order the inspection of the interior and/or
exterior of a rental property if any of the following circumstances exist:
      (1)   The city receives a written or oral complaint from a tenant,
neighbor, code officer, public works employee, police officer, or other
interested party concerning a rental property indicating a current violation of
the Godley Code of Ordinances, any of the standards and codes adopted by the
city under this chapter,state law, or federal law or where the premises appear
to be unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous to the public health or safety;
      (2)   Upon the first-time registration of a rental property with the city
required by this subchapter;
      (3)   The failure of an owner to register rental property as required by
this subchapter; or
      (4)   At any time the rental property is vacant, or without a tenant.
   (B)   When an inspection is ordered, a preliminary inspection shall be
conducted by the Public Works Director or building inspector working at the
direction of the city. This preliminary inspection is to identify issues of
substantial concern that affect the habitability of the property involved, not
merely aesthetic or surface level concerns. Dangerous electrical problems,
water leaks, structural damage/insufficiencies, plumbing/sewer blockages, gas
leaks, and other major problems will be the type of issues the city will be
assessing.
   (C)   The preliminary inspection shall be conducted within ten days of the
Administrator's order.
   (D)   A written report of the preliminary inspection shall be served on both
the Administrator, the occupants of the home and owner/landlord or local
contact within two days of the preliminary inspection. Actual notice must be
achieved on the owner/landlord and/or local contact. This report shall contain
a comprehensive list of any issues that require repair/remedy/correction with
citation to the applicable law, regulation, and/or code offended. If no
actionable issues are present, a written report detailing the preliminary
inspection findings and passing performance shall be served on all parties as
well, to close out the inspection.
   (E)   If actionable dangerous issues exist in the preliminary inspection
report, the owner/landlord has five business days to remedy the issues and
provide the Administrator proof of such compliance. The cost of any remedy is
the responsibility of owner/landlord and not the tenant(s) or the city.
   (F)   Proof of compliance may be achieved by photos, receipts of materials/
work, affidavits of compliance, and/or a second inspection by the Public Works
Director or inspector working at the direction of the city.
   (G)   Failure to remedy a dangerous issue identified in the preliminary
inspection within five business days, and/or the failure to provide proof of a
remedy to all of the dangerous issues identified in the preliminary report, is
a violation of this chapter and may result in the issuance of a criminal
citation for the failure to comply. Additionally, a noncompliant owner/
landlord, will also face a citation for each and every specific code,
regulatory, and or state law violation present at the time. The preliminary
inspection report shall serve as a warning to the owner/landowner.
   (H)   An owner/landlord of rental property, that wishes to contest the
findings of a preliminary inspection report, may, at their own expense, seek an
independent inspection of the rental property. A written report of this
independent inspection shall be filed with the Administrator before the
expiration of the five-day period for compliance. Such inspection must be
conducted by a licensed building inspector, registered and licensed through the
Texas Real Estate Commission. If this written independent inspection report
conflicts in a substantial way with the preliminary inspection report, no
citations may be issued for an offense under this subchapter, until the matter
is heard before the governing body of the municipality - the City Council. The
owner/landlord shall be notified of the date and time of the meeting and be
allowed to present their position to the full Council. The Administrator shall
be responsible fordetermining whether the independent inspection report and
preliminary inspection report are substantially in conflict and invoke a
hearing before the City Council. The decision before the City Council on such
an issue is whether to authorize the issuance of citations, to designate a
period for compliance, and/or to close out an ordered inspection file.
   (I)   The owner/landlord of the rental property shall permit the Public
Works Director, Administrator, and/or building inspector working at the
direction of the city, to enter the rental property (exterior and interior)
when necessary to review compliance with this subchapter for the purposes of
performing an inspection and/or to follow-up on a previous inspection. If the
property to be inspected is occupied by a tenant or tenants, consent must be
achieved of at least one occupant of legal age and authority to provide
consent. If no consent of the occupants may be achieved, the city shall be
responsible for seeking and obtaining a valid administrative search warrant
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction to allow the designated building
inspector, Public Works Director, and/or Administrator access to perform the
inspection. The time period for inspection completion shall toll during any
days where a warrant is being sought to allow entry, and shall not be held
against the owner/landlord for purposes of this subchapter.

§ 150.23 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Administrator shall have the authority to direct a citation be issued
for a violation of the provisions of this subchapter. The Administrator shall
also use due diligence in ascertaining the true owner/landowner or responsible
party of the rental property subject to prosecution. The Administrator shall
use all available public records (CAD, water, voting, and the like) to identify
such person(s)/entities. And, in no case shall the Administrator direct a
citation be issued to more than one owner for the same occurrence of offense.
The Administrator shall instead choose one of the available identified owners,
in their discretion, for purposes of issuance of a citation.

(Ord. 11012016-BUILDING, passed 11-1-2016)
§ 150.35 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   The minimum standards for the continued use and occupancy of all buildings,
regardless of the date of construction thereof, shall be those established by
the International Property Maintenance Code and the International Building Code
as heretofore previously adopted or hereafter adopted or amended by the City
Council, and those standards established by this subchapter. If a building

public nuisance as defined herein, the building shall be in violation of the
minimum standards, and shall be subject to the order of the City Council.
(Ord. 11012016-BUILDING, passed 11-1-2016)
§ 150.36 ENFORCEMENT OFFICER DUTIES.
   The Enforcement Officer shall learn and keep updated on legislative and
judicial changes to the governing law related to substandard buildings. It is
the Enforcement Officer's duty to educate and inform other city staff and the
public about the city's substandard building ordinance, state law and the due
process procedures available to a property owner engaged in an enforcement
action. It is not, however, the duty or responsibility of the Enforcement
Officer to provide legal advice, but instead should encourage legal questions
be directed to a licensed attorney. It is also the duty of the Enforcement
Officer to strictly apply the notice and notification provisions of this
subchapter, always striving to locate and make aware, the true, legal property
owner, lienholder, or other with rights to the property, to allow for
compliance and abatement when possible. The Enforcement Officer shall also
conduct or supervise the inspection of property subject to this subchapter and
report back to the city with accurate, reliable evidence (including but not
limited to photographs, videos, written complaints from neighbors, proof of
attempts to earn compliance, etc.) of the conditions of the property subject to
an enforcement of this subchapter. The Enforcement Officer, acting in good
faith and without malice in the discharge of her duties, shall not thereby
render herself personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or
property as a result of any act or by reason of any act or omission in the
discharge of his duties. Any suit brought against the Enforcement Officer, City
Administrator, Code Enforcement Officer or their designees, because of such act
or omission performed in the enforcement of any provisions of this subchapter,
shall be defended by legal counsel provided by the city until final termination
of such proceedings.
(Ord. 11012016-BUILDING, passed 11-1-2016)
§ 150.37 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES AND PROCESS.
   (A)   Inspection. Whether by personal observation of the Enforcement
Officer, an individual's complaint to the city, referral by the Fire or Police
Chief, or otherwise a building is suspected of being substandard under this
subchapter, an inspection shall be performed and/or supervised by the
Enforcement Officer. The inspection may be performed by the Enforcement
Officer, a licensed and trained building inspector, the City Engineer, Fire
Chief or other trained to review and determine compliance with the laws of the
state, the city's ordinances and the various applicable building codes adopted
by the city.
   (B)   Inspection report. Within 15 days of the completion of the inspection
provided for in division (A), the Enforcement Officer shall prepare or have
prepared an inspection report. The report shall include a comprehensive list of
violations which support that the building is substandard under this
subchapter. The individual violations shall cite the law or code being
violated, in order to provide notice to the city and property owner of the
specific violation(s). The report should also include, for Council review, at
least two estimates of what it would potentially cost to rehabilitate the
substandard building to code compliance or to demolish and haul off the
substandard structure. And, the report shall include the name(s) of all
individuals with a right of ownership to the property after a thorough search
of all who could have an interest in the land. This search should include
researching central appraisal district data, county land deed records, online
property interest searches, speaking with parties knowledgeable about the
property's ownership and any other methods designed to identify all who have a
right of ownership to the property. The report shall then be filed with the
City Secretary's office, with a copy being provided to the City Administrator
for review and action.
   (C)   Compliance request letter. The City Administrator and Enforcement
Officer, within ten days of the filing of the inspection report provided for in
division (B), have the option to mail a letter, certified mail with return
receipt requested to the property owner requesting compliance and providing a
full copy of the inspection report, in lieu of proceeding directly to a
substandard building determination hearing. If sending a compliance request
letter, the letter shall provide a copy of this subchapter providing the
property owner notice of the procedures and policies for substandard building
determinations in the city. The letter shall also inform the property owner
that if the property does not achieve full and complete compliance, addressing
the entire list of violations provided in the inspection report, within 30 days
that a substandard building determination hearing will be scheduled.
   (D)   Substandard building determination hearing notice. If the Enforcement
Officer, in their discretion, does not believe there is time for compliance as
provided for in division (C) and determines that a nuisance exists that
requires the vacation, securing, repair or removal of a building, structure or
nuisance condition on a property or the relocation of the occupants of a
property, the Enforcement Officer shall:
      (1)   Provide notice of the nuisance to the property owner, mortgagee,
lienholder or other with a right to the property as well as any known tenant or
occupant by personal service or by mailing the notice by certified mail return
receipt requested. A copy of the same notice shall also be mailed by regular
United States Postal Service mail to the same list of people sent certified
mail return receipt requested. The city satisfies the requirements of this
subchapter to make a diligent effort, to use its best efforts, or to make a
reasonable effort to determine the identity and address of a property owner,
lienholder, mortgagee or tenant if the city searches the following records:
         (a)   County real property land records;
         (b)   County appraisal district records;
         (c)   Records of the Secretary of State;
         (d)   Assumed name records of the county; and
         (e)   Utility records for the property.
      (2)   Provide detail in such notice of the standard(s) violated under
this subchapter and the necessary action to abate the nuisance; a copy of the
Enforcement Officer's inspection report;
      (3)   Advise such property owner, lienholder, mortgagee, tenant or
occupant of the date, time and place of the substandard building determination
hearing at which a determination will be made by the City Council as to whether
the nuisance exists and whether the real property, building, structure,
premises or any portion thereof complies with the standards of this subchapter;
      (4)   Include a statement in such notice that the property owner,
lienholder, or mortgagee will be required to submit proof of the scope of any
work that may be required to comply with this subchapter and the time it will
take to reasonably perform the work.
   (E)   Date of hearing. The date of the substandard building determination
public hearing before the City Council shall not be fewer than 30 days from the
date of the personal service of the substandard building determination public
hearing notice or deposit of the same in the United States Postal Service mail,
certified mail return receipt requested, whichever is earliest.
   (F)   Hearing notice to be filed with land records. The City Secretary shall
file any substandard building determination public hearing notice in the county
real property records at least ten days before the date of the public hearing.
The filing of notice of the substandard building determination public hearing
shall be binding upon subsequent grantees, lienholders or other transferee of
any interest in the property who acquire such interest after the filing of the
notice and constitutes notice of the hearing on any subsequent recipient of any
interest in the property who acquires such interest after the filing of the
notice. The substandard building determination hearing notice filed with the
county real property records shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the property owner of the affected real
property, if that information can be determined from a reasonable search of the
instruments on file with the County Clerk;
      (2)   A legal description of the property; and
      (3)   A description of the hearing.
   (G)   Conduct of hearing. The City Council shall conduct the substandard
building determination hearing to determine compliance with the standards set
out in this subchapter. This hearing shall be open to the public and strictly
comply with the Texas Open Meetings Act. At the beginning of the hearing and
before the public comments on the issue are heard, the Enforcement Officer and/
or City Administrator shall provide a detailed description of the problems and
violations associated with the property in question; briefing the City Council
and public on the situation. This briefing shall include and incorporate the
findings of the Enforcement Officer's inspection report, any photo/video/audio
evidence collected during the city's inspection and investigation of the
property and the specific issues or violations related to the property that
lead to the Enforcement Officer or City Administrator's belief that the City
Council should determine the building to be substandard. Then, the City Council
shall open the discussion to the public hearing from any party wishing to speak
for or against the substandard building determination. Any person, not the
property owner, a lienholder, mortgagee, or tenant of the property shall be
limited to five minutes speaking time. Upon a discussion of interested third
parties, the City Council shall then give the property owner, lienholders,
mortgagees and tenants or occupants of the property to speak and present any
proof or evidence in support of their position. At hearing, the burden of proof
is on the property owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to demonstrate the scope of
any work that may be required to comply with this subchapter and the time it
will take to reasonably perform the work.
   (H)   Orders and notice after hearing.
      (1)   If, after conducting a substandard building determination hearing,
the City Council finds that a building is in violation of the standards set out
in this chapter, the City Council shall require the property owner, lienholder
or mortgagee of the building to, within 30 days:
         (a)   Secure the building from unauthorized entry; or
         (b)   Repair, remove or demolish the building unless the property
owner, mortgagee or lienholder establishes at the substandard building
determination hearing that the work cannot reasonably be performed within 30
days. If the City Council allows the owner, lienholder or mortgagee more than
30 days to repair, remove or demolish the building, the City Council shall
establish specific time schedules for the commencement and performance of the
work and shall require the property owner, lienholder or mortgagee to secure
the building in a reasonable manner from unauthorized entry while the work is
being performed. The City Council may also order that occupants of the building
be relocated within a reasonable time.
      (2)   The City Council may not allow the property owner, lienholder or
mortgagee more than 90 days to complete any part of the work required to comply
with the order unless the property owner, lienholder or mortgagee has:
         (a)   Submitted at the substandard building determination hearing a
detailed plan and time schedule; and
         (b)   Establishes at the substandard building determination hearing
that the work cannot be reasonably completed within 90 days because of the
scope and complexity of the work. If the City Council allows the property
owner, lienholder or mortgagee more than 90 days to complete any part of the
work required to repair, remove or demolish the building, the City Council
shall require the property owner, lienholder or mortgagee to regularly submit
progress reports to the City Council through the Enforcement Officer to
demonstrate compliance with time schedules established for commencement and
performance of the work and may require the property owner, lienholder or
mortgagee appear before the Enforcement Officer, the City Council or their
designees, to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules. If the property
owner, lienholder or mortgagee owns property, including structures or
improvements on property, within the city's boundaries that exceeds $100,000 in
total value, the City Council may require the owner, lienholder or mortgagee to
post a cash or surety bond in an amount adequate to cover the cost of
repairing, removing or demolishing a building under this subchapter. In lieu of
a bond, the City Council may require the property owner, lienholder or
mortgagee to provide a letter of credit from a financial institution or a
guaranty from a third party approved by the City Council. The bond must be
posted, or the letter of credit or third-party guarantee provided, not later
than the thirtieth day after the date the city issues the order.
      (3)   Within ten days after the date the order is issued, the city shall:
         (a)   File a copy of the order in the office of the City Secretary;
and
         (b)   Publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the city a
notice containing:
               1.   The street address or legal description of the property;
               2.   The date of the hearing;
               3.   A brief statement indicating the results or the order; and
               4.   Instructions stating where a complete copy of the order may
be obtained.
      (4)   After the hearing, the city shall promptly mail by certified mail
with return receipt requested, deliver by the Unites States Postal Service
using signature confirmation service or personally deliver a copy of the order
to the property owner of the building and to any lienholder or mortgagee of the
building. The city shall use its best efforts to determine the identity and
address of any property owner, lienholder or mortgagee of the building.
      (5)   If the building is not vacated, secured, repaired, removed or
demolished, or the occupants are not relocated within the allotted time, the
city may vacate, secure, remove or demolish the building or relocate the
occupants at its own expense. This division does not limit the ability of the
city to collect on a bond or other financial guarantee that may be required by
division (H)(2)(b).
   (I)   Repair, vacation or demolition. The following standards shall be
followed by the City Council in ordering the repair, vacation or demolition of
any building, and any building declared a nuisance under this subchapter shall
be made to comply with one or more of the following:
      (1)   The building shall be repaired in accordance with the building
codes adopted by the city and in effect at the time of the repair applicable to
the type of substandard conditions requiring repair.
      (2)   Repairs shall be deemed feasible only if less than 50% of the
building must be repaired or replaced and the repairs amount to less than 50%
of the building's value.
      (3)   If the building is in such a condition as to make it dangerous to
the health, safety and welfare of the occupants, it shall be ordered vacated
and secured from unlawful entry.
      (4)   If the building requires repairs over greater than 50% of its
surface or amounting to greater than 50% of its value, it shall be demolished.
Further, if a building cannot be repaired so that it will be brought into
compliance with this subchapter, it shall be demolished. Additionally, if the
building as it stands presents an incurable fire hazard in violation of the
terms of this chapter or any ordinance of the city or law of the state, it
shall be demolished. For the purpose of this subchapter, the term "demolished"
includes the cleaning and grading of the building and the removal of all debris
and trash.
      (5)   If the building is not vacated, secured, repaired, removed or
demolished or the occupants are not relocated within the allotted time, the
city may vacate, secure, remove or demolish the building or relocate the
occupants at its own expense, and may thereafter assess expenses and establish
a lien against the property, as set forth in §
150.39(C) of this subchapter.
      (6)   If, after the expiration of the time allotted under division (H) of
this section, the property owner, lienholder or mortgagee fails to comply, the
city may repair or cause the repairs necessary to bring the building into
compliance with this subchapter and only if the building is a residential
building with ten or fewer dwelling units. The repairs may not improve the
building to the extent that the building exceeds the minimum standards, as
defined by this subchapter, and expenses may be assessed as provided in §
150.39(A) of this subchapter.
(Ord. 11012016-BUILDING, passed 11-1-2016)
§ 150.38 REMEDIES.
   To enforce any requirement of this subchapter, any enforcement personnel may
gain compliance by any or all of the following:
   (A)   Taking such action as the Enforcement Officer deems appropriate within
the authorization provided for in this subchapter or any other ordinances of
the city;
   (B)   Causing appropriate action to be instituted in a court of competent
jurisdiction;
   (C)   Ordering the abatement of the nuisance and assessing the costs of
abatement against the property if the property owner does not abate same after
the required notice; or
   (D)   Any other remedies permitted or authorized at law or in equity.
(Ord. 11012016-BUILDING, passed 11-1-2016)
§ 150.39 RECOVERY OF COSTS.
   (A)   Whenever the city enters upon the premises and causes any work to be
performed to abate a nuisance, or if the building or agricultural structure is
not vacated, secured, repaired, removed or demolished, or if the occupants are
not relocated within the allotted time, the city may take such action at its
own expense, and a charge will be made to the property owner, agent or tenant
to recover the costs associated with the abatement. The charge shall be the
actual cost of abatement, plus applicable sales taxes.
   (B)    An administrative fee in an amount set by City Council and maintained
in the city's master fee schedule shall be assessed for a charge established by
this section.
   (C)   If the actual charge and the administrative fee are not paid to the
city within 30 days after billing, the city shall file a lien against the
property. Said lien shall be filed in the deed records of the county. The
charges shown on the lien shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum from
the due date until paid. The lien shall be collected under the same terms and
provisions of law as on city ad valorem taxes. The lien may be extinguished
prior to foreclosure if the owner or other person having an interest in the
legal title to the property reimburses the city for its expenses, interest and
administrative fee(s). If the notice is given pursuant to §
150.37(F) of this subchapter and the opportunity to abate the nuisance or
repair, remove or demolish the building or agricultural structure is afforded
to each mortgagee or lienholder under said §
150.37(F), the lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens as
authorized by the Texas Local Government Code §
214.001(o).

hearings, notice thereof or other recovery of costs and establishment of liens,
when a nuisance has been declared an immediate threat to health and safety by
the Enforcement Officer.

   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
center lines of streets or highways, street lines or highway rights-of-way
lines shall be construed to be the boundaries;
   (B)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be the boundaries;
   (C)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets, or the center lines or
right-of-way lines of highways, the district boundaries shall be construed as
being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the

annexation of any territory, shall institute proceeding on its own motions to
give the newly annexed territory a permanent zoning. (See §
154.008(B) below).
(Ord. 3-86, passed 6-12-1986; Ord. 7-1-99, passed 7-1-1999)

not exceed in costs, including labor and materials or reasonable allowances
therefor, the sum of $250; and
      (4)   Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be
on a lot as herein defined, and in no case shall there be more than one main
building on one lot, unless otherwise provided in this chapter.
   (B)   District A1 Agricultural; use regulations. There exists within and on
the fringes of the city land which is presently used for agricultural purposes
and to which all urban services are not yet available and such land should
appropriately be continued in agricultural use until needed for urban purposes
in conformity with the orderly growth of the city. The A1 Agricultural
District, is created to provide an appropriate zoning for those lands expected
to remain in agricultural or "undeveloped" use for several years. The uses
permitted in the A1 Agricultural District, include normal farming, ranching and
gardening activities except for any form of animal husbandry that may be
specifically prohibited by ordinance. It is anticipated that all of the A1
Agricultural District, will be changed to urban uses and other zoning
categories as the area within the corporate limits becomes fully developed.
Newly annexed territory is zoned as A1 Agricultural District, unless the City
Council, at the time of annexation, designates other zoning categories for that
area.

yard is required. If abutting on the rear of a residential district or a
dwelling, then a rear yard of at least ten feet is required.
      (4)   In computing the required depth of a rear yard for any building or
such yard abutting an alley, the depth of the lot may be considered to the
center of the alley and the required depth of a rear yard measured from the

      (5)   The side and front yards requirements for dwellings shall be waived
where dwellings are erected above stores or shops.
      (6)   On corner lots the side yard regulations shall be the same as for
interior lots, except in the case of side street or reversed frontage (where
the corner lot faces an intersecting street), in which case there shall also be
a side yard on the street side equal to the front yard on the lots in the rear.
No accessory building on the corner lot shall project beyond the front yard
line on the lots in the rear. This regulation shall not be so interpreted as to
reduce the buildable width of a corner lot facing an intersection street, and
of record at the time of passage of this subchapter to less than 28 feet, nor
to prohibit the erection of an accessory building where the regulation cannot
reasonably be complied with. In no event shall there be a corner lot with a

combined area of the dwelling and accessory building shall not cover more than
40% of the total area of the lot.
   (D)   No lot area shall be so reduced that the yards or other open spaces
shall be smaller than prescribed by this subchapter, nor shall the density of

regulations herein established. Side yard area used to comply with minimum
requirements of this subchapter for a building shall not be included as a part
of the required areas of any other building.

      (3)   In case where the required parking spaces are not located on the
same lot with the building or use served, or where the spaces are collectively
or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their
retention for such purposes, shall be properly drawn and executed by the
parties concerned, approved as to form by the City Attorney and shall be filed

subchapter may be continued, although the use does not conform to the
provisions hereof. The use may be extended throughout portions of the buildings
as are arranged or designed for the use, provided no structural alterations,
except those required by law or ordinance, are made therein. If no structural
alterations are made, a non-conforming use of a building may be changed to
another non-conforming use of the same or more restricted classification. If
the non-conforming building is voluntarily removed, the future use of the
premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this subchapter. In the

restrictive or of a higher classification, the provisions of this subchapter
relating to the non-conforming use of buildings or premises existing upon the
effective date of this subchapter shall apply to buildings or premises occupied
or used upon the effective date of that amendment. Repairs and alterations may
be made to a non-conforming building, provided that no structural alterations
or extensions shall be made except those required by law or ordinance, unless
the building is changed to a conforming use.

greater than 50% of its value, the Board of Adjustment may grant a permit for
repair or replacement after public hearing and having due regard for the
property rights of the persons affected when considered in the light of public
welfare and the character of rounding the designated non-conforming use and the
purposes of this subchapter.

§ 154.042 PRELIMINARY PLANNING.
   The subdivider shall avail themselves of the advice and assistance of the
city officials and consult early and informally with the Public Works Director,
or other person designated, before preparing the preliminary plat and before
formal application for its approval in order to save time and money and make

(Ord. 11-5-98, passed 11-5-1998)
§ 154.043 SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A subdivider is encouraged to work with city staff in advance of
presenting a preliminary or replat to the city for filing. Prior to the city
accepting a preliminary plat or replat for filing it must be in compliance with
this subchapter and contain all statutory and ordinance required information.
It must be accompanied with all necessary fees and documentation. This
prefiling review is recommended, but not mandatory. This administrative review
is for form and not content. After the preliminary plat or replat has been
reviewed as to form by staff, the subdivider shall be notified of any defects
that must be corrected prior to filing. The original or corrected preliminary
plat or replat shall be received for filing by the city once this prefiling
review is completed. Any preliminary plat or replat that is filed without
prefiling review, shall be deemed denied for any violation of required form
under this subchapter or state law; and must be refiled with new filing fees.
The preplatting process is for the benefit of both the subdivider and the city;
and refusal of the subdivider to make use of this assistance will result in a
strict interpretation of this subchapter and of state law and a resulting
denial for all violations as to required form.
   (B)   During the platting process, any final plat, preliminary plat or
replat that is discovered to be in violation of the mandatory requirements of
this subchapter and/or a controlling state statute, by city staff or the
engineer named by the city to review the instrument, shall be deemed to be in
technical denial. This denial can be cured by the subdivider requesting in
writing a return to an unfiled status, while the defect is corrected (the
corrected instrument may be refiled and no new fees shall be required for this
refiling); or an appeal to the reviewing entity (Planning Commission or City
Council) at its next meeting, agenda requirements permitting, or a special
called meeting for this purpose within ten working days of the staff denial,
for a determination if the defect is of form or concept. If the reviewing
entity agrees with the subdivider, the plat, preliminary plat or replat shall
be deemed refiled as of the day of the affirmative vote and no new fee shall be
required for this refiling. If denied, then the technical denial is affirmed
and plat, preliminary plat or replat is deemed to be formally denied.
   (C)   All plats, replats and associated materials required to be submitted
for plat approval shall be received in the office of the City Secretary not
later than 3:00 p.m., 14 calendar days prior to the next regular meeting of the
Planning and Zoning Board of the city. The City Secretary shall distribute
copies of the Subdivision to the Public Works Director and Engineer. In the
event a submission is required to be revised, such revision shall be submitted
to the City Secretary not less than five working days prior to the Board
meeting at which the submission is scheduled to be heard. Otherwise, any such
plat shall be deferred to a later Board meeting.
   (D)   The final plat shall only be filed after all engineering plans have
been reviewed and approved (or conditionally approved) by the Public Works
Director and/or City Engineer.
   (E)   Copies:
      (1)   Preliminary plat. Three copies of the preliminary plat and
supplemental materials specified shall be submitted to the city with the filing
fee as provided herein; along with written application for approval prior to
the Council meeting at which it is to be considered.
      (2)   Final plat. Three copies of the final plat and supplemental
materials specified shall be submitted to the city with the filing fee as
provided herein, along with written application for approval prior to the
Council meeting at which it is to be considered.

§ 154.044 APPROVAL OF PLAT.
   (A)   Preliminary plat. Upon reaching conclusions informally (as recommended
in §
154.042 above) regarding the general proposed program and objective, the
subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat (see §
154.045), together with improvement plans and other supplemental material as
applicable in other sections of this subchapter.
      (1)   The Public Works Director, or other person so designated, shall
make a study of the plat and give a report to the Board before its final action
on the preliminary plat.
      (2)   Following a review of the preliminary plat and other materials
submitted for conformity thereof to the regulations, and following negotiations
with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of
improvements to be made by the subdivider the Board shall:
         (a)   Within 30 days after the filing of the preliminary plat, act
thereon as submitted or modified; and
         (b)   If approved, submit the preliminary plat to the Council for
approval;
      (3)   The Council shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the
plat. The action of the Council shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary
plat, referenced, and attached to any conditions required by the Council.
Action of the Council shall be certified by the Mayor. One such copy of the
plat shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained in the files of
the city.
      (4)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat by the Council shall be
deemed an expression of approval as to the layout submitted on the preliminary
plat and as a guide to the installation of streets, water and sewer, and other
required improvements and utilities, and also as to the preparation of the
final or record plat. Except as provided for herein, approval of the
preliminary plat shall constitute conditional approval of the final plat when
all conditions of approval noted have been met.
      (5)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for
one year unless reviewed by the Council in the light of new or significant
information which would necessitate the revision of the preliminary plat. If no
development or change in requirement has occurred which would affect the
proposed plat at the end of the year of an effective approval, the Council may
extend its approval another year without the submission of a new preliminary
plat by again approving the original preliminary plat. No filing fee is
required for approval.
   (B)   Approval of final plat.
      (1)   Upon approval of the preliminary plat the subdivider shall prepare
a final plat (see §
154.046 below). The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as
approved and shall incorporate all changes, directions, and additions imposed
by the Council. The final plat shall not be released for filing until detailed
engineering plans have been approved or conditionally approved by the Public
Works Director and/or City Engineer.
      (2)   If so desired by the developer, the final plat may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary plat which is proposed to be recorded
and then developed; provided, however, that such portion conforms to all the
provisions of this subchapter.
      (3)   Engineering plans showing details of streets, culverts, bridges,
storm drainage, water mains, sanitary sewers and other engineering details of
the proposed subdivision shall be submitted to the Public Works Director along
with the final plat of the subdivision. Such plans shall be prepared by a
registered professional engineer and shall conform to the design standards
established by the city.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the final plat, accompanied by a final filing fee
as prescribed herein, the Public Works Director shall check the plat to
ascertain its compliance with these provisions and the action of the Council.
When the copy of the final plat has been checked and found to meet all the
general requirements and design standards, the developer, or his or her
engineer, shall submit ten copies of the final plat to the Public Works
Director. The Public Works Director shall stamp on each of the ten copies the
certificate of approval of the Council when the final plat has been approved.
The developer, or his or her authorized agent, shall secure the required number
of plats, and record them with the County Clerk, Johnson County, Texas, within
30 days of the date of the final approval, otherwise the final approval of the
Council shall become invalid. Six copies of the recorded final plat shall be
returned immediately to the Public Works Director.
      (5)   Subdivision plats for housing projects, apartment areas, shopping
centers and industrial districts are required when there is to be a dedication
of streets and/or easements. Site plans shall be filed with the city for
approval by the City Council as required by zoning ordinances.

a school, park or playground, the subdivider shall dedicate one-half a normal
residential street, 30 feet, and provide for one-half of the cost of paving and
the full cost of all the utilities necessary. The interested agency shall
provide the necessary right-of-way to make the street 60 feet in width, which
is 30 feet and provide one-half the cost of paving.
(Ord. 11-5-98, passed 11-5-1998)
§ 154.051 REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS FOR STREETS.
   (A)   Conformity to master thoroughfare plan. The arrangement, character,
extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Master
Thoroughfare Plan of the city, and these factors shall be considered in their
relation to existing and planned streets to topographical conditions, to public
safety, and to their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be
served by the streets.
   (B)   Exceptions. When those streets are not on the Master Thoroughfare
Plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
streets in surrounding areas; or
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions
make continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical.
   (C)   Minor streets. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged.
   (D)   Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontages, deep lots with rear-service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection to residents of property
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   (E)   Reverse strip controlling access. Reverse strip controlling access to
streets shall be prohibited except where its control is definitely placed under
the jurisdiction of the city under conditions approved by the Council.
   (F)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet
shall be avoided.
   (G)   Arterial street intersections. Arterial street intersections shall be
at 90-degree angles. Other street intersections shall be laid out so as to
intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect
at less than 60 degrees.
   (H)   Street right-of-way widths. Street right-of-way widths shall be as
shown on the Master Thoroughfare Plan and, where not shown therein, shall not
be less than the following:
Description Minimum Width
Description                                           Minimum Width

Minor street; apartment, commercial, industrial areas 60 feet**
* Maximum width, 140 feet; depending upon the location and the City Street
Plan with which the major thoroughfare is to be connected.
** 50 feet if curb and gutter is proposed.
 
   (I)   Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited except when essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with other
requirements of this subchapter, and where the Council finds it shall be
practical to require the dedication of the other one-half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Whenever a partial street exists along a common
property line, the other portion of the street shall be dedicated. Where part
of a street is being dedicated along a common property line and the ultimate
planned width is 60 feet, the first dedication will be 30 feet.
   (J)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall
have a turnaround provided at the closed end. They shall have an outside
roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and shall have a street property line
diameter of at least 100 feet.
   (K)   Connections with existing streets. New streets of like alignment shall
bear the names of existing streets and shall be dedicated at equal or greater
widths than the existing streets. No street name shall be used which will
duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names shall
be subject to the approval of the City Council.
   (L)   Street improvements. All new streets dedicated within a subdivision
shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the city.
(Ord. 11-5-98, passed 11-5-1998)
§ 154.052 REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS FOR BLOCKS.
   (A)   Determination of length, width and shape. The length, width and shape
of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
      (1)   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated;
      (2)   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; and
      (3)   Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
   (B)   Specifications for length. In general, intersecting streets, which
determine the block lengths and widths, shall be provided at such intervals as
to best serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets, or to
comply with customary subdivision practices. Where there is no existing
subdivision to control, the block lengths shall not exceed 1,600 feet, and
shall generally be 1,000 to 1,200 feet in length; nor shall any block be less
than 500 feet in length; however, in conditions where it is appropriate that
these standards be varied, the length may be increased or decreased to meet the
existing conditions, having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of
traffic and public safety.
   (C)   Specifications for width. Where no existing subdivision controls, the
block depth and/or width shall be platted to give lots with a depth-to-width
ratio of generally not more than two and one-half to one, and in no case more
than four to one, and the platting shall be such that the block width or depth
generally shall not exceed 350 feet nor be less than 215 feet. When possible,
the block width and depth shall be such as to allow two tiers of lots back-to-
back.
   (D)   Walkways. Where blocks in the vicinity of a school, park or shopping
center are platted, 1,000 feet or longer, the Council may require a walkway
near the middle of the block, or at a street that terminates between the
streets at the end of the block. The walkway shall not be less than four feet
nor more than eight feet in width, and shall have a four-foot concrete walk
through the block from sidewalk to sidewalk, or to the rear of the property
line, if no street exists.
   (E)   Sidewalks. Where pedestrian walks are required by the city, they shall
not be less than four feet wide and shall be provided around the perimeter of
all blocks.

      (1)   Where corner lots are key lots, that is where lots face the
frontage street and other lots face the side street, the corner lot shall have
a front building line on both streets.
      (2)   Key lots or irregular-shaped lots shall have sufficient width at
the building line to meet frontage requirements of the appropriate zoning
district. Also, the rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all
utilities, including garbage collection, and shall not be less than ten feet.
   (D)   Depth. No lot shall be platted less than 100 feet in depth; however,
in cases where an irregularly-shaped tract is platted into lots and a remnant
piece of property is of sufficient area to plat one or more lots, the Council
may waive the depth requirement to prevent a hardship on the developer.
   (E)   Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angels
or radial to the street line.
   (F)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or where necessary to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. Where lots have double
frontage, a front building line shall be established for each street.
   (G)   Alteration of lot size.
      (1)   It shall be lawful to increase the size of lots from that
originally platted, provided, however, that there is no remaining portion of a
lot or a lot smaller than the original lot; and also provided, that the final
plat is submitted in accordance with the requirements of a final plat as
contained hereinabove; also, provided that the change is in compliance with
Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, Ch. 212.
      (2)   No lot shall be replatted to reduce the size of the lot originally
platted by a common dedicator, unless the consent of all property owners in the
same addition has been obtained. The required consent may be implied where
another lot or lots in the addition, as recorded, have already been subdivided
and built upon in the manner prescribed above. No lot will be reduced in width
below 75-foot frontage with an area of 7,500 square feet, except for property
having a local retail, commercial or manufacturing zone classification and not
for residential use.
   (H)   Building permits. When an applicant exhibits a duly executed and
recorded deed covering a lot having a minimum dimensions of 75 feet by 100
feet, and the lot is being assessed for city taxes as conforming to the
established lot, pattern and zoning classification in the block where located,
then a building permit may be issued, provided the requested use of the
property conforms to the permanent zoning of the property covered by the
application.

of additional width as may be designated by the Public Works Director, and
which will be reasonably adequate for the purpose. Parallel streets or parkways
may be required in connection with this easement.
   (C)   Exclusion of easement in computing lot area. The lot area shall be
computed exclusive of all easements except easements for public utilities.
(Ord. 11-5-98, passed 11-5-1998)
§ 154.055 UTILITIES REQUIRED.
   Sanitary sewers, storm drainage, water mains and street improvements, along

each new subdivision in accordance with the current official standards of the
city.
   (A)   Proposed development corporate limits. All proposed subdivisions
located inside the corporate limits of the city shall connect to the water and

subdivider shall be required to pay for and extend such services as required to
serve the proposed development.
   (B)   Utilities extension not feasible. Where the sewage collection system
or the water distribution system does not abut the proposed development and the
extension of the service is not feasible or would pose an economic hardship,
the developer shall be required to furnish with his or her final plat
satisfactory evidence, including (but without limitation) the results of soil
tests and borings and statements from local and state health authorities,
sanitarians, engineers and other proper officials, that water satisfactory for
human consumption may be obtained from surface or sub-surface water sources on

requirements of this subchapter and the approved final plat regarding
improvements with respect to the block facing the street and/or streets on
which the property abuts, including the installation of streets, drainage and
water and sewer utilities, all according to the requirements of the city; or
      (2)   The developer and/or owner files a corporate surety bond with the
City Secretary in a sum equal to the cost of the improvements for the

§ 154.058 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The City Council may authorize a variance from these regulations when,
in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In
granting a variance, the Council shall prescribe only conditions that it deems
necessary or desirable to the public interest in making the findings herein
below required. The Council shall take into account the nature of the proposed
usage of land involved, the existing usage of the land in the vicinity, the
number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the
probable effect of the variances upon traffic conditions and upon the public
health, safety, convenience and welfare of individuals in the vicinity. No
variance will be granted unless the Council finds the following:
      (1)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land
involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this subchapter
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land;
      (2)   The variances are necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the applicant, and that the granting of the
variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare of
individuals, or injurious to other properties in the area;
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing
the orderly subdivision of other lands in the area in accordance with the
provisions of this subchapter; and
      (4)   The Council may not authorize a variance that would constitute a
violation of any other valid ordinance of the city.
   (B)   These findings of the Council, together with the specific facts upon
which such findings are based, shall be incorporated in the official minutes of
the Council meeting at which the variance is granted. Variances may be granted
only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this subchapter so
that the general health, safety and welfare of citizens may be secured, and
substantial justice be done. Pecuniary hardship to the subdivider, standing
alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship.

§ 154.059 EXCEPTIONS TO PROVISIONS OF SUBCHAPTER.
   Plats or subdivisions which have received preliminary approval by the
Council within one year prior to the effective date of this subchapter shall be
excepted from the requirements of this subchapter; provided that the final plat
of the subdivision is approved and filed for record within 180 days after the
effective date of this subchapter, or within one year after the approval date
of the preliminary plat, whichever is greater.
(Ord. 11-5-98, passed 11-5-1998)
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
§ 154.070 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The Texas Legislature has found that the unrestricted operation of
certain sexually oriented businesses may be detrimental to the public, health,
safety and welfare by contributing to the decline of residential and business
neighborhoods and the growth of criminal activity. Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, §
243.001(a). The purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses is to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
citizens of the city, to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
prevent the concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city, to
deter sexually related criminal activity occurring in and around sexually
oriented businesses and to protect the health of patrons and employees of the
businesses from sexually transmitted diseases. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
   (B)   It is the intent of the City Council that the locational regulations
of §
154.082 below are promulgated pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, Ch. 243 as they
apply to a sex parlor, nude studio, modeling studio, love parlor, adult
bookstore, adult movie theater, adult video arcade, adult movie arcade, adult
video store, adult motel or other similar commercial enterprise the primary
business of which is the offering of a service or the selling, renting or
exhibiting of devices or any other items intended to provide sexual stimulation
or sexual gratification to the customer. It is the intent of the City Council
that all other provisions of this chapter are promulgated pursuant to the
Godley City Charter and Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, Ch. 243 and Ch. 215, Subchapter
B.
   (C)   It is the intent of the City Council to protect and preserve the
health, safety and welfare of the patrons of "adult oriented establishments,"
as well as the health, safety and welfare of the town’s citizens. Statistics
and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United
States and research by the Sexually Oriented Businesses Task Force indicate the
following:
      (1)   Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such "adult
oriented establishments," especially those which provide closed booths,
cubicles, studios and rooms for the private viewing of so-called "adult" motion
pictures and/or video tapes and/or live entertainment;
      (2)   Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by
patrons, clients or customers of such "adult oriented establishments" for the
purpose of engaging in certain sexual acts;
      (3)   Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such
establishments in order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or
customers of the establishments within the booths, cubicles and rooms;
      (4)   Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on
the entrances and/or exits are in use encourage patrons using the booths,
cubicles, studios and rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes
and/or with other members of the same sex, thereby promoting and encouraging
prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and
urine to be deposited on the floor and/or walls of the booths, cubicles,
studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and
safety of other persons who may come into contact with the deposits;
      (5)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B arnebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections;
      (6)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by HIV in the United States;
      (7)   The U.S. Surgeon General in his October 22, 1986 report advised the
American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual
contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood
components, and from an infected mother to her newborn;
      (8)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
      (9)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities;
      (10)   A reasonable licensing scheme is an appropriate mechanism to know
the true identity of the owners, operators and employees, their criminal
background (since someone convicted a sexually related crime leads to the
rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in
contravention of this subchapter or other laws), identifies potential witnesses
or suspects and by preventing minors from working in the establishments;
      (11)   That there is an increasing commercial exploitation of human
sexuality by owners and operators of commercial establishments where alcoholic
beverages are served or offered for sale for consumption on the premises, or
where alcoholic beverages are permitted to be consumed;
      (12)   That the exploitation takes place in the form of employing or
permitting persons to perform or exhibit their nude or semi-nude bodies to
other persons as an inducement to such other persons to purchase alcoholic
beverages or to consume alcoholic beverages while on the premises;
      (13)   The exploitation is further often accompanied by serious and
dangerous criminal activity, such as the possession or use of controlled
substances, the proliferation of drug-related activity, prostitution,
disorderly conduct, assaults and the like;
      (14)   That the direct result of the exploitation in the context of the
location where it is permitted (i.e., where alcohol is served or consumed)
threatens the preservation of property values of adjoining and adjacent
properties and neighborhoods;
      (15)   That the direct result of the exploitation is the moral
degradation and disturbances of the peace and good order of the community;
      (16)   The commercial exploitation of the nude and semi-nude acts are
adverse to the public’s interest and the quality of life, tone of commerce and
total community environment in the city;
      (17)   The hour restrictions on private clubs in Texas under the current
Alcoholic Beverage Commission were originally adopted to "safeguard the
welfare, safety and temperance of the people of Texas," and we hereby find that
the hours when applied to sexually oriented businesses equally safeguard the
welfare and safety of the citizens of the city;
      (18)   The important governmental interests of the prevention of crime
and prevention of disease (such as the City of Chattanooga presented evidence
of high crime and health risks which supported that city’s adoption of City
Code Section 11-435(d) as outlined in DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107
F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997)) are furthered by the prohibition of touching between
the sexually oriented business employees and customers and when a six-foot
buffer zone is established;
      (19)   The reasonable regulation and supervision of the adult oriented
establishments tends to discourage such sexual acts and prostitution, and
thereby promotes the health, safety and welfare of the patrons, clients and
customers of the establishments;
      (20)   The continued unregulated operation of adult oriented
establishments including, without limitation, those specifically cited in this
provision, is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and
safety of the citizens of the city;
      (21)   The above findings raise substantial governmental concerns;
      (22)   Such reasonable regulations are within the powers granted to the
city by the Constitution and laws of the state in order to protect the public
health, safety and welfare and have been enacted by this subchapter without any
intention of limiting or restricting the contents of any communicative
materials or of denying or restricting the rights of any adult to obtain, view,
distribute, exhibit or sell any sexually oriented materials protected by the
United States and/or State Constitution;
      (23)   The place restrictions hereinafter in accordance with powers
granted to the city by the Constitution and laws of the state including Tex.
Loc. Gov’t Code, Ch. 243; such regulations will provide needed protection to
the community from the adverse effects of sexually oriented businesses without
depriving the businesses of adequate opportunities to locate within the city
for this subchapter satisfies City of Renton, Woodall and other case law for
this subchapter translates into five and eight-tenths percent of the city being
available to the businesses as reasonable alternative avenues of communication;
and
      (24)   In order to reduce the secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses, regulation of signage is necessary to protect the health, safety
and welfare of the public.

   (D)   For the purposes of divisions (A) and (B) above, measurement shall be

apply for an exemption until at least 12 months have elapsed since the date of

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Tex. Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City of Godley, Texas, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. OR-10292012-FDP, passed 10-29-2012)
§ 156.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Godley are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. OR-10292012-FDP, passed 10-29-2012)
§ 156.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. OR-10292012-FDP, passed 10-29-2012)
§ 156.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. OR-10292012-FDP, passed 10-29-2012)

levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”.

for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the

   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. See Area of Special Flood Hazard.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  (For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include  the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as
well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions
or (2) Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic
structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine

   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this ordinance.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
156.22(B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/
2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
ordinance, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (§
156.03).
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon: (a) showing a good and
sufficient cause; (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that (1) the criteria outlined in §
156.23(A) through (I) are met, and (2) the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety.
