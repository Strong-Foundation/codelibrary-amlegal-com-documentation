   B.   The City Council shall have the power, and is hereby authorized, to
levy, assess, and collect annual taxes not to exceed the maximum limit set by

property having a location within the corporate limits of the City and not
exempt from taxation by the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas.
   C.   All taxes due the City shall be payable at the office of the City

insufficient to identify such property, the City shall have the right to plead
a good description of the property to be assessed, to prove the same, and to
have its judgment foreclosing the tax lien and/or for personal judgment against
the owner for such taxes as such ownership and property appears on the
certified tax roll.

for a debt service, provided that no amendment shall increase the authorized
expenditures to an amount greater than the total of the estimated income for
the current fiscal year plus funds available from prior years. At the close of
each fiscal year, the unencumbered balance of each appropriation shall revert
to the fund from which it was appropriated and shall be subject to future
appropriations, but appropriations may be made in furtherance of improvements
or other objects of work of the City that will not be completed within the
current year.
SECTION 8.05 FAILURE TO ADOPT ANNUAL BUDGET
   If the Council fails to adopt the budget by September 30th, the amounts

fiscal year. The levy of property tax will be set to equal the total current
fiscal year tax receipts, unless the ensuing fiscal year budget is approved by

shall not have the right to demand payment thereof out of monies raised or to
be raised by taxation. All such bonds shall be issued in conformity with the
laws of the State of Texas. The City shall have the power to borrow money for
public improvements in any other manner provided by law, including certificates
of obligation as authorized by Chapter 271 of the Texas Local Government Code.

Secretary shall certify the result of this examination to the City Council at
its next regular meeting. If the City Secretary shall certify that the petition

a notice of insufficiency has been sent by the City Secretary, by filing a
supplementary petition. In such event, the same procedures shall then be
followed by the City Secretary and City Council as in the case of the original
petition for the same purpose.
SECTION 12.05 COUNCIL CONSIDERATION AND SUBMISSION TO VOTERS
   When the City Council receives an authorized initiative petition, certified
by the City Secretary to be sufficient, the City Council shall either (a) pass
the initiated ordinance without amendment within twenty (20) days after the

regular or special election to be held on a uniform election date of the State
of Texas, but not less than ninety (90) days from the date that the City
Secretary certifies the submission to the City Council.
   When the City Council receives an authorized referendum petition, certified
by the City Secretary to be sufficient, the City Council shall reconsider the
referred ordinance. If, upon such reconsideration, such ordinance is not
repealed, it shall be submitted to the voters of the City at a regular or
special election to be held on a uniform election date of the State of Texas,

referendum provisions of this Charter shall be submitted by ballot title, which
shall contain a clear, concise statement, without argument, of the substance of
such ordinance. The ballot used shall have below the ballot title the following
proposition, one above the other in the order indicated: “FOR THE ORDINANCE”
and “AGAINST THE ORDINANCE.” Any number of ordinances may be voted on at the
same election and may be submitted on the same ballot.
   If a majority of electors voting on a proposed initiated ordinance shall
vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon become an ordinance of the City. A
referred ordinance which is not approved by a majority of the electors voting
thereon shall thereupon be deemed repealed. If conflicting ordinances are
approved by the electors at the same election, the one receiving the greatest
number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.
SECTION 12.07 POWER OF RECALL
   The people of the City reserve the power to recall the Mayor or any other

Secretary a petition, signed by qualified voters of the City equal in number to
at least thirty (30) percent of the number of registered voters residing in the
City at the time of the last regular municipal election of the City demanding
the removal of the Mayor or other member of the City Council. The petition

sought and one of the signers of each petition paper shall make an affidavit
that the statements made therein are true.
SECTION 12.08 RECALL ELECTION

the City Secretary. Within thirty (30) days after the petition is filed, the
City Secretary shall determine its sufficiency and, if found to be sufficient,
shall certify this fact to the City Council at its next regular meeting. If a
recall petition is found to be insufficient, it may be amended within ten (10)
days after notice of such insufficiency by the City Secretary, by filing a
supplementary petition. In that event, the same procedures shall then be
followed by the City Secretary and the City Council as in the case of an
original petition. The finding of insufficiency of a recall petition shall not
prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose. The City Council
Member whose removal is sought by a recall petition may, within five (5) days
after such petition has been certified and presented to the City Council,
request in writing that a public hearing be held to permit him to present facts
pertinent to the charges specified in the petition. In this event, the City
Council shall order such public hearing to be held not less than five (5) days
nor more than fifteen (15) days after receiving such request for a public
hearing.
   If the City Council Member whose removal is sought does not resign, the City
Council shall order a recall election and fix a date for such election, the
date of which shall not be less than ninety (90) days from the date the
petition was submitted to the City Council or from the date of the public
hearing if one was held, whichever is later, or at the earliest date thereafter
permitted by the Texas Election Code.
SECTION 12.09 RECALL BALLOT

question there shall be printed the following as to each person named:
“FOR THE REMOVAL OF (name of person.)”
“AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF (name of person.)”
SECTION 12.10 RESULTS OF A RECALL ELECTION
   If a majority of the votes cast at a recall election is against removal of a
Council Member named on the ballot, that member shall continue in office. If a
majority of the votes cast at such election are for the removal of the City
Council Member named on the ballot, the City Council shall immediately declare
the office vacant and such vacancy shall be filled in accordance with the
provisions of this Charter. A City Council Member thus removed shall not be a
candidate to succeed himself in an election called to fill the vacancy created.
SECTION 12.11 LIMITATIONS ON RECALL
   No recall petition shall be filed against the Mayor or any other Council
Member within six (6) months after he first takes office, or within six (6)
months after an election for his recall, nor within six (6) months of the end

but not limited to, heat, light, power, telephone service, transportation, or
other telecommunication providers for compensation or hire. The City shall have
the power by ordinance to grant, renew, and extend all franchises of all public
utilities of every character operating within the City. No such franchise shall
be granted until after a public hearing shall have been called and held and
until such ordinance shall have been passed and accepted by the franchisee.
SECTION 13.02 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE
   No public utility or other franchise shall be transferable except with the
approval of the City Council expressed by ordinance.
SECTION 13.03 OWNERSHIP, USE AND CONTROL OF STREETS
   No franchise or easement involving the right to use the streets, alleys,
highways, parks, and public ways shall be valid unless granted in compliance
with the terms of this chapter. No granting of a franchise by ordinance
pursuant to this chapter shall convey any ownership or interest in any property
of the City other than the right to use the public property for purposes of
such franchisee’s operations as expressed in the ordinance granting such
franchise.
SECTION 13.04 RIGHT OF REGULATION
   In granting, amending, renewing and extending public service and utility
franchises, the City shall retain the right to:
   (1)   Repeal such franchise by ordinance for failure to comply with the
terms thereof, such power to be exercised only after due notice and hearing;
   (2)   Require an adequate extension of plant and service as is necessary to
provide adequate service to the public and require maintenance of the plant and
fixtures at the highest reasonable standard of efficiency, based upon
applicable state and federal regulations;
   (3)   Establish reasonable standards of service and quality of products and
prevent unjust discrimination in service or rates;
   (4)   Impose regulations to ensure safe, efficient and continuous service to
the public. The franchise holder in opening and refilling all earth openings
shall re-lay the pavement and do all other work necessary to complete
restoration of streets, sidewalks or grounds to a condition equally as good as

   (5)   Upon notice to franchisee and a reasonable opportunity to be heard, to
regulate, locate, or prohibit the erection of any and all poles, wires, or
other utility equipment, conveyance, or structure, on the streets, alleys and
public places of said City, and to cause the same to be changed, removed,
altered, increased, diminished, placed underground, or be supported by poles of
such material, kind, quality and class as may be determined by the City Council
whether the same be telegraph, telephone, electric, cable television, or
otherwise, and to enforce the provisions hereof by appropriate action in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
SECTION 13.05 COMPENSATION FOR FRANCHISE
   All persons, corporations, or association of persons, to whom a franchise or
privilege may hereafter be granted shall pay to the City for such privilege
such compensation as may be fixed by the City Council in the grant of such
franchise or privilege. Such compensation as fixed by contract or provided by
State law(s) shall become due and payable at such time as the City Council
shall fix in the granting of such franchise or privilege. The failure of any
franchisee to pay said compensation when due may result in forfeiture of the
franchise or privilege.
SECTION 13.06 COUNCIL TO FIX AND REGULATE CHARGES, FARES OR RATES
   If applicable State law so provides, the City Council shall determine, fix,
and regulate the charges, fares or rates of any person, firm, or corporation
enjoying a franchise or privilege granted under the provisions of this chapter,
and shall prescribe the kind of service to be furnished to the public by such
person, firm, or corporation, and the manner in which it shall be rendered and
may from time to time alter or change such rules, regulations, and compensation
after reasonable notice and public hearing. The rates, charges and fares so
fixed shall at all times be reasonable and permit the franchisee a reasonable
opportunity to earn a reasonable return on the franchisee’s invested capital
used and useful in providing service to the public in excess of its reasonable
and necessary operating expenses. In this connection, the City Council may
require any utility or franchise holder to furnish such financial reports and
information as the City Council may request including reports of actual
operating costs and the financial conditions of its operations within the City.
The City Council may employ, at the expense of such franchisee, necessary
outside experts to examine and audit the accounts and records of the franchisee
to determine the reasonableness of such charges, fares, and rates.

§ 33.60 OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment (the Board) shall adopt rules to govern its
proceedings, provided, however, that the rules are not inconsistent with this
subchapter or state law. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at other times as the Board may determine. The Chairperson, or

the attendance of witnesses.

shall keep record of its examinations and other official actions, all of which
shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public
record.
      (3)   Appeals to the Board may be made by any person aggrieved by any
municipal officer, department or board affected by any decision of the Planning
and Zoning Commission. The appeal shall be filed with the board by the City
Secretary within 15 days after the original decision is rendered. The appeal
shall be accompanied by all papers constituting the record pertaining to the
appeal. Formal notice of the appeal shall be issued by the City Secretary, the
notice to specify the grounds upon which the appeal is made. The Board shall
set a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal.
      (4)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certified to the
Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him or her, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the
board or a court of record on application, on notice to the office from whom
the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
      (5)   Upon notice of appeal being given to the City Secretary, the
applicant must file a fee with the notice of appeal to the Board. The Board of
Adjustment, with the concurrence and approval of the City Council shall
determine and set forth a fee schedule for the purpose of recovering the
administrative cost of processing requests and appeals called for by this
subchapter. The fee shall be paid by the applicant and shall not be designed

revenue for other than recovery of actual administrative cost incurred by the
city. Immediately upon receipt of the application and fee, the City Secretary
shall note thereon the date of filing, and make a permanent record thereof.
      (6)   No appeal to the Board for the same or related variance on the same
piece of property shall be allowed prior to the expiration of six months from a
previous ruling by the Board on any appeal to the body unless other property in
the immediate vicinity has, within the six-month period, been changed or acted
on by the Board or City Council so as to alter the facts and conditions on
which the previous board action was based. The change of circumstances shall
permit the rehearing of an appeal by the Board prior to the expiration of the
six-month period, but the conditions shall in no way have any force in law to
compel the Board, after a hearing, to grant a subsequent appeal. The subsequent
appeal shall be considered entirely on its merits and the peculiar and specific
conditions related to the property on which the appeal is brought.
      (7)   At a public hearing relative to any appeal, any interested party
may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The burden of proof shall be
on the applicant to establish the necessary facts to warrant favorable action
of the Board on any appeal. Any special exception or variance granted or
authorized by the Board under the provisions of this subchapter shall authorize
the issuance of a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, as the case
may be, for a period of 90 days from the date of the favorable action of the
Board, unless the Board shall have in its action approved a longer period of
time and has so shown such specific longer period in the minutes of its action.
If the building permit and/or certificate of occupancy, shall not have been
applied for within the 90-day period or such extended period as the Board may
have specifically granted, then the special exception or variance shall be
deemed to have been waived and all rights thereunder terminated. The
termination and waiver shall be without prejudice to a subsequent appeal and
such subsequent appeal shall be subject to the same regulations and
requirements for hearing as herein specified for the original appeal.
   (B)   Actions of the Board.
      (1)   In exercising its powers, the Board may, on conformity with the
provisions of the statutes of the State of Texas as existing or hereafter
amended, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and make the order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and shall have all
the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The Board shall have
the power to impose reasonable conditions to be complied with by the applicant.
      (2)   The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary
to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such
administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance or to effect any
variance in the ordinance.
      (3)   Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any
decision of the Board, or any taxpayer of officer, department or Board of the
municipality may present to a court of record (district court) a petition, duly

specifying the grounds of illegality. The petition shall be presented to the
court within ten days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
Board and not thereafter.

persons who are owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the property

the U.S. Post Office.
      (3)   Notice shall also be given by publishing the same in official
publication of the city at least one time and at least 15 days prior to the
date set for the hearing, which shall state the time and place of the hearing.

         (a)   A special exception is a permission given by the Board properly
authorized by this subchapter in specific cases for an applicant to use his or
her property in a manner contrary to the provisions of this ordinance provided
the use serves the general welfare and preserves the community interest
         (b)   A variance is an authorization by the Board granting relief and
doing substantial justice in the use of the applicant’s property by a property
owner where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship.
      (2)   Special exceptions.
         (a)   A special exception may be granted an applicant when the Board
finds:
            1.   That the granting of the exception will not be injurious or
otherwise detrimental or injurious to the public health, safety, morals and
general welfare of the general public;
            2.   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental or
injurious to the property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in which
the property is located; and
            3.   That the granting of the exception will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this subchapter.
         (b)   In determining its finding, the Board shall take into account
the character and use of adjoining buildings and those in the vicinity, the
number of persons residing or working in the building or upon the land, traffic
conditions in the vicinity, and the conformance of the area to the zoning map
and general plan.
         (c)   The Board may, after public hearing and subject to the
conditions and safeguards herein contained, authorize special exceptions to
this subchapter as follows:
            1.   Permit the modification of a yard, lot area or lot width
regulation requirements as may be necessary to secure appropriate improvement
of a parcel of land where the parcel was separately owned on the effective date
of this subchapter, and is not adjacent to another parcel of the same ownership
and where the parcel is of such size that it cannot be improved without such
modification or of the restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved
without the modification; and
            2.   May grant a permit for the extension of a use, height or area
regulation into an adjoining district for a distance of not more than 25 feet,
where the boundary line of the district divides a lot in single ownership as of
the effective date of this subchapter.
         (d)   In granting any special exception under the provisions of this
ordinance, the Board may designate the conditions in connection therewith
which, in its opinion, will secure substantially the purpose and intent of this
subchapter.
      (4)   Variances.
         (a)   A variance may be granted to an applicant when the Board finds:
            1.   That there are special circumstances or conditions applying to
the land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or
conditions are peculiar to the land or building and do not apply generally to
lands or buildings in the same zone or neighborhood, and that the circumstances
or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this
subchapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or
building;
            2.   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zone or
neighborhood in which the property is located;
            3.   That the granting of the variance is necessary for the
reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as granted by the
Board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose;
            4.   That the literal enforcement and strict application of the
provisions of this subchapter will result in an unnecessary hardship
inconsistent with the general provisions and intent of this subchapter and that
in granting the variance the spirit of the subchapter will be preserved and
substantial justice done; and
            5.   In addition to considering the character and use of adjoining
buildings and those in the vicinity, the Board, in determining its findings,
shall take into account the number of persons residing or working in the
buildings or upon the land and traffic conditions in the vicinity.
         (b)   The Board may, after public notice and hearing and subject to
the conditions and safeguards herein contained, vary or adapt the strict
application of any of the terms of this subchapter under the power and
authority herein granted and consistent with state law.
         (c)   In granting any variance under the provision of this subchapter,
the Board may designate such conditions in connection therewith which, in its
opinion, will secure substantially the purpose and intent of this subchapter.
         (d)   The Board may permit the change of occupancy from one
nonconforming use to another nonconforming use when the extent of the second
nonconforming use is found to be less detrimental to the environment than the
first.
         (e)   The Board may permit the remodeling or enlargement of a
nonconforming use only when the remodeling or enlargement will not prolong the
life of the nonconforming use. A specific period of time for the return to
conformity can be required.
         (f)   The Board may permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming
structure or building on the lot or tract occupied by the building, provided
the reconstruction does not, in the judgment of the Board, prevent the return
of the property to a conforming use or increase the nonconformity of a
nonconforming structure.
         (g)   The Board may permit such variance of the front yard, side yard,
rear yard, lot width, lot depth, coverage, minimum setback standards, off-
street parking or off-street loading regulations where the literal enforcement
of the provisions of this subchapter would result in an unnecessary hardship,
and where the variance is necessary to permit a specific parcel of land which
differs from other parcels of land in the same district by being of the
restricted area, shape or slope that it cannot be developed in a manner
commensurate with the development permitted upon other parcels of land in the
same district. A variation from the standard established by this subchapter
shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor for
financial reason only, nor shall the modification be granted to permit any
person a privilege in developing a parcel of land not permitted by this
ordinance to other parcels of land in the district.
      (5)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that
there is error on any order, requirement, decision or determination may by the
Planning and Zoning Commission/Building Inspector in the enforcement of this
subchapter.
      (6)   The Board shall interpret the intent of the zoning district map
where uncertainty exists because the physical features on the ground vary from
those on the zoning districts map and none of the rules of this subchapter set
forth in §
159.81 apply.
   (E)   Appeals from the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer, department, board or
bureau of the city aggrieved by any decision of the Board may seek review by a
court of record of the decision, in the manner provided by the laws of this
state.
      (2)   Upon presentation of the petition in accordance with state law, the
court of record may allow a writ of convenience directed to the Board to review
the decision of the Board and shall prescribe therein the time within which a
return thereto must be made and served upon a realtor’s attorney, which shall
not be less than ten days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of
the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decisions appealed from, but the
court may, on application, on notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant
a restraining order.
      (3)   The Board shall not be required to return the original papers acted
upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies
thereof or such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ. The return
shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and material to
show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified.
      (4)   If, upon hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is
necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or
appoint a reference to take the evidence as it may direct and report the same
to the court with his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law, which
shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the
court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm wholly or party, or may
modify the decision brought up for review.
      (5)   Costs shall not be allowed against the Board unless it shall appear
to the court that it acted with gross negligence, or in bad faith, or with
malice in making the decision appealed from.
      (6)   All issues in any proceedings under this section shall have
preference over all other civil actions and proceedings.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.01 RATES, CHARGES AND FEES; POLICIES AND REGULATIONS.
   That the City Council of the city hereby fixes and prescribes the following:
rates, charges and fees for water service in the city; rules, regulations,
policies in connection therewith, which shall be applicable to and the
controlling ordinance relative to the city’s waterworks system (hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the system); to-wit.
   (A)   No free service permitted. No free service of the city’s system shall
be allowed to any person, firm, corporation or association whatsoever
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as customer). Should the city or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities make use of the services of facilities of the
city’s system, the city shall make payment of the reasonable value thereof out
of funds from sources other than the revenues of the city’s system.
   (B)   Connection specifications and inspection requirements. One-inch meters
shall not be allowed on lines smaller than six inches. All sprinkler system
connections shall be installed and maintain double-check valves or air gaps.
All connections made pursuant to the terms and conditions of this section shall
be inspected by the City Inspector or a duly designated agent of the city.
   (C)   Monthly rates for water services. The monthly charge for water and
sewer service shall be as contained in and attached to the annual operating
budget of the city.
   (D)   Effective date of rate changes. The effective date of any rate
ordinance shall be contained in that ordinance.
   (E)   Billing procedures for water service.
      (1)   Water meters. The city staff shall read all water meters once each
month and render a monthly bill for water and sewer services to each customer.
The bill shall be payable within 20 days from receipt thereof. No partial
payments shall be accepted. Bills not paid within 20 days shall have added
thereto a charge of 10% of the past due amount. Failure to receive a city
utility bill shall not relieve a customer of any responsibility for the bill.
      (2)   Meter readings. A customer who disputes the meter reading may
request a re-read of their meter. A customer’s first re-read is done at no
charge. All subsequent re-readings will be charged in accordance with the fee
schedule. If the re-read indicated a city miscalculation, the fee will be
waived.
      (3)   Meter speed. A customer who believes that the meter is not running
accurately may request that the meter be pulled and tested. When a meter is
pulled it will be replaced with a new meter. If the pulled meter is found to be
reading slow or within the American Water Works Association (AWWA) specified
range, a fee will be assessed. If the meter is found to be reading fast, any
billings will be adjusted and there will be no charge to the customer for
pulling, testing or replacing the meter.
   (F)   Failure to pay for service; discontinuation of service by city; fees
to resume service.
      (1)   The city reserves the right to discontinue and cut off a customer’s
water service for failure to pay his or her water bill within 25 days from the
date the bill was mailed to the customer. Payment by the customer by dishonored
check shall constitute failure to pay.
      (2)   Termination notice will be sent. This notice will offer a
conference for disputes of the correctness of the billing. The conference is
not for payment delays or waivers. The conference will be with a staff person
of authority to rescind a disconnect order. The notice will give a date that
service will be disconnected.
      (3)   Service will be reconnected only after all charges and fees have
been satisfied. Payment must be remitted in cash, money order or cashier’s
check.
      (4)   Payment plans: arrangements or contract payment plans may be
established within city staff discretion for those with large balances or
hardships. Arrangement is made for those customers who request and need a short
extension (less than two weeks) to avoid cut-off procedures. If the account is
not cleared in the established time, cut-off procedures commence.
      (5)   Contracts may be established for those customers with excessive
balances that cannot be cleared with one payment. A monthly contract amount is
agreed upon and must be paid in a timely manner along with the total current
amount due. If the contract payment and current amount payment due are not made
timely, the contract is automatically void and the cut-off procedures commence.
   (G)   Reservation of rights by city.
      (1)   The city reserves the right at any time to shut off the water in
its mains for the purpose of cleaning, repairing or making any connections or
extensions, or for the purpose of repairing machinery, reservoir or any part of
the system.
      (2)   The city may refuse service connection to one property if the
customer has delinquent utility charges outstanding at another property, i.e.
builders with multiple projects or rental properties.
      (3)   Water lines extending beyond an authorized water service meter are
considered private water service lines and consequently any repairs and related
water loss shall be the responsibility of the water customer. In the event that
a water customer suffers a water loss and, after review by the city, such loss
is determined to be without negligence and beyond the control of the water
customer, the city may apply the minimum water rate to the water lost and
adjust the amount due the city.
      (4)   Master-metered accounts: in addition to disconnect provisions
herein, the city may provide a notice of pending discontinuance to each
dwelling unit served by the master-meter in the event of failure to pay for
utility services.
      (5)   If a utility account is in arrears in any utility (water, sewer,
garbage, recycling, or in late fees accrued on any utility) the city shall
follow the procedures outlined in the service disconnection section and
disconnect water service to the customer.
      (6)   The city reserves the right to discontinue and disconnect a
customer’s sanitary sewer service for failure to pay his or her sewer bill in
accordance with the procedures established herein for a customer’s failure to
pay his or her water bill.
      (7)   The City of Heath may institute a drought contingency plan as
needed.
   (H)   Indemnity of city. It is expressly understood, as a pre-requisite to
furnishing water service to customers, that the city is not liable for any
damages resulting from breakage or leakage of any pipes on any premises.
   (I)   Right of entry.
      (1)   Any water customer of the city shall, at all reasonable times
permit the city to enter his or her premises or building to examine his or her
water pipes and fixtures, the manner in which the water is used and for the
purposes of reading, repairing or testing water meters.
      (2)   For purposes of reading, repairing or testing water meters, any
city water customer shall maintain a 30-inch clearance of vegetation,
landscaping material or other barrier around the water meter. Failure to
maintain a 30-inch clearance may result in the city’s removal of the material
with associated costs being charged to the water utility customer.
   (J)   Consent of city required.
      (1)   No plumber or person except an employee or agent of the city, will
be allowed to tap any street main or pipes belonging to the city or to do any
work in the street or alleys or public grounds in connection with the laying of
street service connections for connection with their mains without consent of
city staff.
      (2)   Any person causing damage to a water meter, curb stop or any other
component of the city water system shall be liable for all costs associated
with repairs. If the person responsible for the damage cannot be identified,
the property owner or contractor working for the property owner will be
assessed appropriately.
   (K)   Additional rules and regulations. The city reserves the right to make
other rules and regulations, policies and provisions as may be necessary for
the preservation, protection and economical administration of its waterworks
system.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 55.15 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the MS4 or watercourses any materials, including but not
limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or
contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than
stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge
to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated - less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting
activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the city prior to the time of the test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the EPA, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver,
or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
   (B)   Prohibition of illicit connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
(Ord. 101221B, passed 12-21-2010)
§ 55.16 SUSPENSION OF MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4) ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city.
(Ord. 101221B, passed 12-21-2010)
§ 55.17 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
city prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 101221B, passed 12-21-2010)
§ 55.18 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a
facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the city reasonable access to
the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 101221B, passed 12-21-2010)
§ 55.19 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS.
      (A)   The city may adopt requirements identifying BMPs for any activity,
operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or Waters of the United
States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through
the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
   (B)   Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at that
person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed

§ 56.03 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the POTW for
the City of Heath and enables the City of Heath to comply with all applicable
state and Federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et
seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing Sources of
Pollution (40 C.F.R. Part 403). The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or
otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
      (3)   To protect both the POTW personnel who may be affected by
wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;
      (4)   To promote the reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge from the POTW;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW; and
      (6)   To enable the city and NTMWD to comply with the applicable TPDES
permit issued for the operation of the POTW, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other Federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. This chapter
authorizes the issuance of industrial user wastewater discharge permits;
provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes
administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the
setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the
program established.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.04 ADMINISTRATION.
   Except as otherwise provided herein, the environmental officer shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted to or duties imposed upon the environmental officer may be delegated by
the environmental officer to his/her duly authorized representative, which may
be any entity with which the city has contracted for operation of the POTW or a
treatment plant and/or with which the city has entered into a multi-
jurisdictional, or inter-jurisdictional agreement providing for wastewater
service, or a particular officer or employee thereof.

gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, perchlorates,
bromates, carbides, hydrides, sulfides or any other substances which are a fire
or other hazard to the system, which by reason of their nature or quantity are,
or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to
cause fires, explosions, or be injurious in any other way to the facilities or
operation of the POTW.
      (2)   Any substance which creates a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than 140°F or 60°C using the test methods specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.21.
      (3)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 standard units (SU),

of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause
acute worker health and/or safety problems.
      (5)   Any liquid or vapor, including wastewater, having a temperature
higher than 150°F or 65°C; or exhibiting heat in amounts which will inhibit
biological activity in a POTW causing an interference; or, in any case,
exhibiting heat in such quantities that the temperature at the introduction
into the POTW exceeds 40°C or 104°F.
      (6)   Any pollutant(s), including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD,
etc.) and total dissolved solids, released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or
pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause pass through or interference at the POTW or which will
cause the POTW to be in non-compliance with any Federal or state sludge use or
disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations.
      (7)   Any free or emulsified fats, waxes, greases or oils containing
substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32° and
150°F (0° to 65°C); or any combination of free or emulsified fats, waxes,
greases or oils, if, in the opinion of the environmental officer, it appears
probable that such wastes:
         (a)   Can deposit grease or oil in the sanitary sewers in such a
manner as to clog the sewers;
         (b)   Can overload skimming and grease handling equipment;
         (c)   Are not amenable to bacterial action and will therefore pass
through to the receiving water without being affected by normal sewage
treatment processes; or
         (d)   Can have deleterious effects on the treatment process due to
excessive quantities.
      (8)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
      (9)   Solid, liquid, or viscous substances in amounts which may cause
obstruction to the flow in sanitary sewers or other interference with the
proper operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not
limited to: ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings,
entrails, lime slurry, lime residues, slops, chemical residues, paint residues,
bulk solids or waste paper.
      (10)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater, which either singly or by interaction with other substances are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry
into the sanitary sewers for maintenance or repair.
      (11)   Wastewater containing COD in concentrations which are not amenable
to treatment, or any other substance which is determined by the environmental
officer to not be amenable to treatment by the POTW.

         (b)   Unusual taste or odor-producing substances.
      (14)   Wastewater which imparts color that cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the POTW's effluent
thereby violating the applicable TPDES permit issued for the operation of the
POTW.
      (15)   Storm water, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, unless specifically authorized by the
environmental officer.
      (16)   Sludges, screening, or other residues from industrial activities.

suitable garbage grinders to such a degree that all particles shall be carried
freely under the flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers.
   (C)   In cases where, in the opinion of the environmental officer, the
character of the sewage from any manufacturer or industrial plant building or
other premises is such that it will damage the system, or cannot be treated
satisfactorily in the system, the environmental officer shall have the right to
require such user to dispose of such waste otherwise and prevent it from
entering the POTW.
   (D)   Unusual flow and concentration of any of the above shall be pretreated
to a concentration acceptable to the city, if such wastes can:
      (1)   Cause damage to the POTW;
      (2)   Impair processes;
      (3)   Incur treatment cost exceeding those of normal sewage;
      (4)   Render the water unfit for stream disposal or industrial use; or
      (5)   Create a public nuisance.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.06 LOCAL LIMITS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to discharge into the POTW, any metals, chemicals
or toxic substances in excess of the following concentration limits:
      (1)   The following heavy metals and toxic materials in the form of
compounds or elements in solution or suspension in concentrations exceeding

      (2)   The city may set limits on a permit by permit basis for any other
parameter that would pose a threat to water quality, health and safety, or the
POTW or the discharge of which would otherwise result in violation of §
56.05 of this chapter, including but not limited to, priority pollutants found
in the POTW influent at a concentration at or above 0.1 mg/L or numerical
aquatic life criteria as defined by TCEQ.
      (3)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes without prior written permission
from the environmental officer.
   (B)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW. The environmental officer may impose mass limitations in addition
to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
   (C)   Dilution is prohibited as a substitute for treatment. Except where
expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water,
or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment
standard or requirement. The environmental officer may impose mass limitations
on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.07 FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 C.F.R. Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated.
   (A)   Upon the promulgation of a categorical pretreatment standard for a
particular industrial category or subcategory, the categorical pretreatment
standard, if more stringent than specific local limits imposed under this
chapter for industrial users subject to that categorical standard, shall
supersede the local limits imposed under this chapter.
   (B)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
environmental officer may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c).
   (C)   Where industrial users combine wastestreams prior to treatment,
compliance with an applicable categorical pretreatment standard will be
determined either prior to combining the wastestreams or following treatment of
the combined wastestream (by applying the combined wastestream formula found in
40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)).
   (D)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the industrial user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 C.F.R. § 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
   (E)   An industrial user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical
pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.15.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.08 CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The environmental officer reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or
in industrial user wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)

each as specified in 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.
   (B)   Compliance with state authority. Industrial users within the
jurisdiction of this chapter shall comply with applicable sections of the Texas
Water Code, Ch. 26.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.11 INDUSTRIAL USER WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All non-domestic users shall notify the environmental officer of the
nature and characteristics of their wastewater prior to commencing their
discharge. The environmental officer is authorized to prepare a form for this
purpose. All non-domestic users must complete the industrial user wastewater
discharge permit application, the industrial waste survey, and/or other forms
as identified by the environmental officer. If a non-domestic user fails to
complete any form identified as required by the environmental officer, the non-
domestic user will be in violation of this chapter. The environmental officer
may periodically require industrial users to update this information.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for significant industrial users to discharge
wastewater, whether directly or indirectly, into the POTW without first
obtaining an industrial user wastewater discharge permit from the city. Any
violation of the terms and conditions of an industrial user wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§
56.21, 56.37, and 56.38 of this chapter. Obtaining an industrial user
wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to
obtain any other permits required by Federal, state, or local law.
   (C)   The environmental officer may require that other industrial users,
including liquid waste haulers, obtain industrial user wastewater discharge
permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. The
environmental officer also may prohibit the disposal of hauled pollutants,
including hauled wastewater. The discharge of hauled pollutants, including
hauled wastewater, is subject to all other requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   Industrial waste haulers, including haulers of wastewater, may
discharge loads only at locations designed by the environmental officer.
      (2)   No load may be discharged without prior consent of the
environmental officer.
      (3)   The environmental officer may collect samples of each hauled load
to ensure compliance with applicable standards.
      (4)   The environmental officer may require the industrial waste hauler
to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
      (5)   Industrial waste haulers, including haulers of wastewater, must
provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a
minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number,
truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known
or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous
wastes.
   (C)   All existing significant industrial users connected to or contributing
to the POTW shall obtain an industrial user wastewater discharge permit within
180 days after the effective date of this chapter. The application must be
submitted to the environmental officer within 90 days after the effective date
of this chapter.
   (D)   New connections. Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or
recommence discharging nondomestic wastes into the POTW must obtain an
industrial user wastewater discharge permit prior to beginning or recommencing
such discharge. An application form must be filed by the SIU at least 90 days
prior to commencement of discharge. Categorical SIUs must provide an
application form and a supplemental baseline monitoring report, the two of
which are to contain the information required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12, as set out
in §
56.12.
   (E)   The environmental officer may deny or condition new or increased
contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the
POTW by industrial users where such contributions do not meet applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause
the POTW to violate its TPDES permit.
   (F)   Reapplication. Once permitted, the industrial user has the duty to
reapply if the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by the permit
after the expiration date of the industrial user wastewater discharge permit.
The industrial user must submit an application for a new permit at least 90
days before the expiration of the permit. The application form may be obtained
from the environmental officer.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.12 INDUSTRIAL USER WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION AND BASELINE
MONITORING REPORT.
   (A)   All significant industrial users required to obtain an industrial user
wastewater discharge permit shall complete and file with the environmental
officer, an application upon a form provided by the city. The city may charge a
permit application fee, which if charged, shall accompany the application.
   (B)   The environmental officer shall issue an industrial user wastewater
discharge permit if he/she determines that pretreatment facilities are adequate
for efficient treatment and that discharged wastes will comply with all
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, including those imposed by
this chapter. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and
will be returned to the industrial user for revision.
   (C)   Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment
standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a
category determination under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later,
existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards
and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be
required to submit to the environmental officer an industrial user wastewater
discharge permit application and a baseline monitoring report, the two of which
shall contain the information identified in divisions (1) through (6), below.
At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources
that become subject to categorical standards subsequent to the promulgation of
an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the environmental officer a
report which contains the information listed in divisions (1) through (5),
below. New sources shall also be required to include this report information on
the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. New sources shall give estimates to the information
requested in divisions (4) and (5).
      (1)   Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address
of the facility including the name of the operators and owners.
      (2)   Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control
permits held by or for the facility.
      (3)   Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief
description of the nature, average rate of production, and the standard
industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial
user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which
indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. The
user shall submit a list of all chemicals utilized in its processes and
appropriate material safety data sheets (MSDSs).
      (4)   Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW
from each of the following:
         (a)   Regulated process streams; and
         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e). The environmental officer may
allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or
feasibility considerations.
      (5)   Measurement of pollutants.
         (a)   The user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process.
         (b)   In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and
analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by
the categorical pretreatment standards or by the environmental officer) of
regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily
maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported.
The sample shall be representative of daily operations.
         (c)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
otal phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The
environmental officer may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any
industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is
infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional
composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where
the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged.
         (d)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section.
         (e)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the categorical
pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along
with supporting data shall be submitted to the environmental officer.
         (f)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40
C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any
other applicable sampling and analytical procedures suggested by the
environmental officer or other parties, approved by EPA.
         (g)   The environmental officer may require the user to submit a
pollutant scan of the wastewater discharge.
         (h)   The environmental officer may allow the submission of a baseline
monitoring report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
         (i)   The baseline monitoring report shall indicate the time, date and
place of sampling and methods of analysis, and the industrial user shall
certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles
and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
      (6)   Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user (as specified in §
56.18), and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is
required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements, the shortest
schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment
and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in §
56.13 of this chapter.
      (8)   Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has
been modified by a removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined
wastestream formula (40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different
factors variance (40 C.F.R. § 403.13) at the time the user submits the report
required by this section, the information required by divisions (6) and (7)
shall pertain to the modified limits.
      (9)   If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal
allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 C.F.R. §
403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 C.F.R. §
403.13) after the user submits the report required by this section, any
necessary amendments to the information requested by divisions (6) and (7) of
this section shall be submitted by the user to the environmental officer within
60 days after the modified limit is approved.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.13 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE PROGRESS REPORTS.
   The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by §
56.12(C)(7):
   (A)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer,
completing plans, executing contract for major components, commencing
construction, completing construction, etc.).
   (B)   No increment referred to in §
56.13(A) shall exceed nine months.
   (C)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule
and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress
report to the environmental officer including, at a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason
for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the
construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine
months elapse between such progress reports to the environmental officer.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.14 NINETY DAY COMPLIANCE REPORT.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
the commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the environmental officer a report containing the information
described in §
56.12(C)(4), (C)(5), and (C)(6). For industrial users subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits established by the environmental officer in
accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c), this report shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all
other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed
in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production
during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with §
56.18 of this chapter.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.15 PERIODIC REPORT ON CONTINUED COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Any significant industrial users subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard, after the compliance date of such categorical standard, or, in the
case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall
submit to the environmental officer during the months of June and December,
unless required more frequently in the categorical standard or by the
environmental officer, TCEQ, or EPA, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such
categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a
record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the
reporting period for the discharge reported in §
56.12(C)(4), except that the environmental officer may require more detailed
reporting of flows. At the discretion of the environmental officer and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, etc., the environmental officer may agree to alter the months during
which the above reports are submitted. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with §
56.18 of this chapter.
   (B)   Where the environmental officer has imposed mass limitations on an
industrial user as provided for by 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(d), the report required by
division (A), above, shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards in the discharge for the
industrial user.
   (C)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the environmental officer in accordance with the
procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c), the report required by division (A), above,
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For
all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production
(or other measure of operation), the report required by division (A), above,
shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting
period.
   (D)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in
good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (E)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement of this
section monitors any pollutant more frequently that required by the
environmental officer, using the procedures prescribed in §
56.16(A) of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
this report.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.16 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SIGNIFICANT NON-CATEGORICAL INDUSTRIAL
USERS.
   (A)   Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the
environmental officer at least once every six months (on dates specified by the
environmental officer) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of
the pollutants required to be reported by the environmental officer. These
reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered
by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40
C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or
where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques
are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
environmental officer or other persons, approved by the EPA. This sampling and
analysis may be performed by the environmental officer in lieu of the
significant non-categorical industrial user. Where the environmental officer
collects all the information required for the report, the non-categorical
significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
   (B)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
56.18 of this chapter.
   (C)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in
good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (D)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement of this
section monitors any pollutant more frequently that required by the
environmental officer, using the procedures prescribed in §
56.16(A) of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
this report.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)

   (B)   And shall be signed as follows:
      (1)   By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user
submitting the reports is a corporation.
      (2)   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively.
      (3)   The principal executive officer or environmental manager having
responsibility for the overall operation of the discharging facility if the
industrial user submitting the reports is a Federal, state, or local
governmental entity, or their agents.
      (4)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
division (1), (2), or (3) of this section if:
         (a)   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described
in division (1), (2), or (3);
         (b)   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well, or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and
         (c)   The written authorization is submitted to the environmental
officer.
      (5)   If an authorization under division (4) is no longer accurate
because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall

      (3)   The provisions of Section 309(c)(6) regarding responsible corporate
officers.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.19 PERMIT ISSUANCE PROGRESS.
   (A)   Permit duration. Industrial user wastewater discharge permits shall be
issued for a specified period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued
for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the environmental
officer.
   (B)   Permit appeals. Any interested person, including the industrial user,
may petition to appeal the terms of a permit, or the denial of a permit, to the
Environmental Appeals Committee (as established by §
56.22 of this chapter), within 30 days of the final permit decision.
      (1)   Failure to submit to a timely petition for review shall be deemed
to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
      (2)   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the permit
provisions objected to, the reasons for these objections, and the alternative
condition, if any, it seeks to be placed in the permit. Any reasons advanced
against a permit denial shall be fully explained.
      (3)   The effectiveness of the permit shall not be stayed pending a
reconsideration by the Committee, unless the environmental officer expressly so
states. If, after considering the petition and any arguments put forth by the
environmental officer, the Committee determines that reconsideration is proper,
it shall remand the permit, or permit application, back to the environmental
officer for reconsideration. Those permit provisions being reconsidered by the
environmental officer on remand shall be stayed pending reissuance, unless the
Committee expressly states to the contrary.
      (4)   An Environmental Appeals Committee decision not to reconsider a
final permit, or the denial of a permit, shall be considered final
administrative action for purposes of judicial review.
      (5)   If the Environmental Appeals Committee fails to act within 30 days,
a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied.
      (6)   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final
administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the State District Court.
   (C)   Permit action and modification. The environmental officer has the
power to deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or
changes in the nature of pollutants, to the POTW by an industrial user where
such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate the
applicable TPDES permit issued for the operation of the POTW. The environmental
officer may modify the industrial user wastewater discharge permit for good
cause including but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   To incorporate any new or revised Federal, state, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
      (2)   To address material or substantial alterations or additions to the
industrial user's operation processes, or discharge volume or character which
were not considered in drafting the effective permit.
      (3)   A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW
that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the
authorized discharge.
      (4)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat
to the POTW, POTW personnel, or the receiving waters.
      (5)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit.
      (6)   Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts
in the permit application or in any required reporting.
      (7)   Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical standards
pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.13.
      (8)   To correct typographical or other errors in the permit.
      (9)   To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a
new owner or operator.
      (10)   Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not
create a violation of any applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or
other laws, rules, or regulations. The filing of a request by the permittee for
a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a
notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any
permit condition.
   (D)   Permit transfer. Industrial user wastewater discharge permits may be
reassigned or transferred to a new owner and/or operator with prior approval of
the environmental officer, provided:
      (1)   The permittee must give at least 30 days advance notice to the
environmental officer.
      (2)   The permittee must provide a copy of the existing permit to the new
owner or operator.
      (3)   The notice must include a written certification by the new owner or
operator which:
         (a)   States that the new owner or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes;
         (b)   Identifies that the permittee has provided a copy of the
existing permit to the new owner or operator;
         (c)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur;
and
         (d)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
permit.
      (4)   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the
industrial user wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility
transfer.
      (5)   Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation
of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance
schedule. Such schedules may not extend the compliance date beyond applicable
Federal deadlines.
   (E)   Permit termination. 
      (1)   Industrial user wastewater discharge permits may be terminated for
good cause, including but not limited to, any of the following reasons:
         (a)   Falsifying self-monitoring reports.
         (b)   Tampering with monitoring equipment.
         (c)   Refusing to allow proper inspecting authorities timely access to
the facility premises and records.
         (d)   Failure to meet effluent limitations.
         (e)   Failure to pay fines.
         (f)   Failure to pay sewer charges.
         (g)   Failure to meet compliance schedules.
         (h)   Failure to notify the environmental officer of significant
changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge.
         (i)   Failure to provide prior notification to the environmental
officer of changed conditions pursuant to §
56.28(C) of this chapter.
         (j)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant

wastewater discharge permit application.
         (l)   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility.
         (m)   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the industrial user wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.
      (2)   A user will be notified of any proposed permit termination and
offered an opportunity to show cause under §
56.21(H) of this chapter why the proposed termination should not occur.
      (3)   Industrial user wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon
cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All industrial user
wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the
issuance of a new permit to that user.
   (F)   Permit reissuance. The user shall apply for permit reissuance by
submitting a complete industrial user wastewater discharge permit application
form a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing
permit.
   (G)   Continuation of expired permits. An expired permit will continue to be
effective and enforceable until the permit is reissued if:
      (1)   The industrial user has submitted a complete industrial user
wastewater discharge permit application form at least 90 days prior to the
expiration date of the user's permit.
      (2)   The failure to reissue the permit, prior to expiration of the
previous permit, is not due to any act or failure to act on the part of the
industrial user.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.20 GENERAL REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the environmental officer within 24 hours of becoming aware
of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the environmental officer within
30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
   (B)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of §§
56.15 or
56.16 monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by this chapter or
by the environmental officer, using the procedures as prescribed in 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(g)(4), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (C)   Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established
in this chapter or the industrial user wastewater discharge permit shall retain
for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring activities and results
(whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this chapter or the
industrial user wastewater discharge permit) and shall make available for
inspection and copying by the EPA, TCEQ, or the environmental officer. This
period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved
litigation regarding the industrial user or the city, when requested by the
state or the Federal government, or when specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the environmental officer. For all samples, such records
shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   The date, exact location, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the person or persons taking the samples;
      (2)   The date analyses were performed;
      (3)   Who performed the analyses;
      (4)   The analytical techniques/methods used;
      (5)   The results of such analyses;
      (6)   The outfall number(s) for which samples were taken;
      (7)   The sampler's name, affiliation, and signature;
      (8)   Type of sample(s) collected;
      (9)   Number of parts or sample intervals of the sample(s);

(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.21 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Telephone call or e-mail communication. 
      (1)   After discovery of an industrial user violation, the environmental
officer may inform the non-compliant user by telephone or by e-mail
communication concerning the violation committed by the user. If by telephone,
the environmental officer will speak to the authorized user contact and explain
the violation along with the possible enforcement action against the user if
the violation continues to occur. The environmental officer will gather the
following information:
         (a)   Why the violation occurred;
         (b)   Whether the problem has been corrected;
         (c)   Whether the violation could occur again; and
         (d)   When the problem has been or will be corrected.
      (2)   The information received from the contact concerning the violation
will be documented along with time and date of call in the violation summary
file. Such telephone call may be utilized to provide verbal notification of
minor violations. If communication is by e-mail and the industrial user does
not provide the above information in a timely manner, the environmental officer
will follow-up via telephone. Use of the telephone call or e-mail communication
does not limit the environmental officer's ability to take any other action
authorized by this plan.
   (B)   Notification of violation. When the environmental officer finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental officer may serve
upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the environmental officer. If the user denies that
any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective action is necessary,
an explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention shall be submitted
to the environmental officer within 15 days of receipt of the notice.
Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
environmental officer to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (C)   Consent orders. The environmental officer may enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for non-compliance. Such
documents may include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
non-compliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents
shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to divisions (D) and (E) of this section and shall be judicially
enforceable.
   (D)   Show cause hearing. The environmental officer may order a user which
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the environmental
officer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Compliance orders. When the environmental officer finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental officer may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time limit. If the user does not come into
compliance within the specified time limit, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances
are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-
monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a Federal pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
   (F)   Cease and desist orders. When the environmental officer finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations
are likely to recur, the environmental officer may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions. 
      (1)   The environmental officer may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after any reasonable notice to the user that is practical under the
circumstances, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
environmental officer may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
environmental officer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
environmental officer may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the
user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the environmental officer that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
divisions (H) of this section are initiated against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the environmental officer prior to
the date of any show cause or termination hearing under division (D) or (H) of
this section.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge. 
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in §
56.19(E) of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of industrial user wastewater discharge permit
conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of pretreatment standards.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (D) of
this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the environmental officer shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
   (I)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the environmental officer finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial user
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental officer may fine such
user in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest
shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 10% per month. A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
      (3)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (J)   Appeals from administrative enforcement actions. Any industrial user
subject to any order issued, any administrative fine imposed, or any
enforcement action taken by the environmental officer pursuant to his/her
authority in this §
56.21, may appeal the order, action, or fine by filing a written notice of
appeal with the environmental officer (the environmental officer may provide
forms for this purpose). Such notice of appeal shall be filed within fifteen
days of notice of the order, action, or fine.

      (2)   In any decision issued by the Committee, the order shall specify
the time in which the compliance with the order must be taken. A copy of the
order shall be delivered to the appellant or person to whom the order is
directed in person or sent to him/her by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested).
   (D)   Upon the hearing of an appeal from a permit issuance, modification, or
denial by the environmental officer, the Committee shall determine if there is
a preponderance of evidence to support the environmental officer's permitting
decision. The decision of the Committee shall be in writing. If the Committee
determines that there is a preponderance of evidence to support the permitting
decision of the environmental officer, the Committee shall affirm his/her
decision. If the Committee determines that there is not a preponderance of
evidence to support the permitting decision of the environmental officer, the
Committee shall remand the permit, or permit application, back to the
environmental officer for reconsideration. A copy of the decision of the
Committee upon the permitting appeal shall be delivered to the appellant in
person or sent to him/her by registered or certified mail. An Environmental
Appeals Committee decision not to reconsider a final permit, or denial of a
permit, shall be considered final administrative action for purposes of
judicial review.

C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures
approved by the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the EPA. Where 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not include
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the
EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and
analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the environmental
officer or other parties, approved by the EPA.
      (2)   Determined from suitable samples taken at the control manhole
provided or other control points authorized by the environmental officer
provided at the expense of the industry.
   (C)   The Environmental Officer may select an independent firm or laboratory
to perform sampling and laboratory analyses.
   (D)   The determination of the character and concentration of industrial
wastewater shall be made by the environmental officer at such times and on such
schedules as he/she may establish.
   (E)   The environmental officer may require any industrial user to
compensate NTMWD and/or the city, as appropriate, for the costs of sampling,

   (D)   All fees required under this chapter shall be invoiced, upon the
environmental officer's request, to the contributing industry or commercial
firm by NTMWD and/or the city and shall be payable as indicated on the invoice.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.25 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER SURCHARGE.
   (A)   A surcharge may be applied in addition to the monthly sewer service
charge for the discharge of wastewater with concentrations of either BOD or TSS
concentrations exceeding that of “normal domestic sewage,” to cover the
additional costs of treating such wastewater. Such a charge is collected by the
city.
   (B)   The surcharge shall be calculated as follows:
         C = [B(Bu-250) + S (Su-250)] x F x V
      Where:
         C   =   surcharge to the user in dollars
         B   =   unit cost factor for treating one unit of BOD (per 1,000
gallons)
         Bu   =   the tested BOD of the discharge
         S   =   unit cost factor for treating one unit of TSS (per 1,000
gallons)
         Su   =   the tested TSS of the discharge
         F   =   a factor of 8.34 to convert mg/L to pounds/ gallon
         V   =   monthly billing volume (discharge) in thousand gallons
   (C)   If the concentration of BOD or TSS in the discharge is less than the
normal strength for that category above specified, there shall be no surcharge
for that category, nor shall there be credit given to the total surcharge if
the concentration of either BOD or TSS is less than the normal concentration.
   (D)   All BOD and TSS values used in determining the surcharge shall be re-
evaluated and adjusted to reflect any changes in wastewater characteristics as
sampling results indicate necessary.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.26 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The environmental officer, as well as other authorized representatives
of the city, EPA, TCEQ, and the Texas Department of Health, or any successor
agencies bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to
enter the premises of any industrial user at any reasonable time for the
purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, examination and
copying of records, sampling and testing of any wastewater discharged into the
POTW, as well as of any wastewater prior to treatment or discharge, and
inspection of any pretreatment facilities.
   (B)   The environmental officer shall carry out all inspection and
monitoring procedures necessary to determine compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (C)   The environmental officer shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the industrial user's
operations.
   (D)   The environmental officer may require the industrial user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The user's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by
the industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater
flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Anyone acting under this authority shall observe the established rules
and regulations concerning safety, internal security, and fire protection.
   (F)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
industrial user at the written or verbal request of the environmental officer
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by
the user.
   (G)   Any denial of access or unreasonable delay in allowing the
environmental officer access to a user's premises shall be a violation of this
chapter.
   (H)   Search warrants. If the environmental officer has been refused access
to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any industrial user wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the environmental officer may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.27 CONTROL MANHOLE.
   (A)   When necessary to monitor wastewater discharged into the POTW, the
environmental officer may require an industrial user to provide and install, at
its own expense, a suitable control manhole in an easily accessible location on
the premises from which the waste is discharged in order to adequately sample
and measure such wastewater. Installation of meters, equipment and accessories
as deemed necessary by the environmental officer may also be required.
   (B)   A required control manhole shall be:
      (1)   Near the outlet of each building lateral, sewer, drain, pipe, or
channel, which connects with the wastewater system;
      (2)   Designed and constructed to prevent infiltration by ground or
surface water;
      (3)   Located to provide ample room in or near the facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analyses; and
      (4)   Maintained by the user at all times in safe and proper operating
condition.
   (C)   Before beginning construction of a control manhole, the user shall
submit plans to the environmental officer for review and approval to insure
compliance with this section. Plans must include any meters or other equipment
required to be installed.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.28 PRETREATMENT REQUIRED.
   (A)   Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with all pretreatment standards and requirements, including
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in §§
56.05 and
56.06 of this chapter, with the time limitations specified by EPA, TCEQ, or the
environmental officer, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. The environmental officer may
require the development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for
the installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
   (B)   Before beginning construction of pretreatment facilities, the user
shall submit detailed plans and operating procedures for the facility to the
environmental officer for review and approval. The review and approval of such
plans and procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
environmental officer and city under the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   All industrial users shall promptly notify the environmental officer
in advance of any change in the volume or character of pollutants in their
discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which
the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12
(p). The environmental officer may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of an industrial user wastewater discharge permit
application form.
   (D)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards and
requirements shall be made available to the environmental officer and to other
authorized officials of the city, TCEQ, or EPA upon request.
   (E)   The determination of the character and concentration of industrial
wastewater shall be made by the environmental officer at such times and on such
schedules as he/she may establish.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.29 NOTICE OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The environmental officer shall publish annually a list of industrial
users in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or
other pretreatment requirements during the previous 12 months. The notification
shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the
same period. Said list shall be published in the largest daily newspaper
published in the city, if none published in the city then it shall be published
as the city normally publishes notices.
   (B)   For purpose of this section; an industrial user is in significant
noncompliance if its violation(s) meets one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken during a six month
period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit
for the same pollutant parameter;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
which 33% or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken
during a six month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum
or longer-term average) that the control authority (i.e., the environmental
officer) determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare or the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90 day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (8)   Any other violation or group of violations which the control
authority (i.e., the environmental officer) determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.30 BYPASS.
   (A)   Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provisions of divisions (B) and (C), below.
   (B)   Notice.
      (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the environmental officer, if possible at least
ten days before the date of the bypass.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass to the environmental officer within 24 hours from the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The environmental officer may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.
   (C)   Prohibition of bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the environmental officer may take
enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         (c)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under division
(B) of this section.
      (2)   The environmental officer may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the environmental officer determines that
it will meet the three conditions in division (C)(1) of this section.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.31 SLUG CONTROL PLAN.
   (A)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from slug discharges, as
defined in §
56.01 of this chapter. The environmental officer may require the industrial
user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The
plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying NMTWD and the city of
accidental or slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a
prohibition under 40 C.F.R. § 403.5, with procedures for follow-up written
notification within five days; and
      (4)   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental
spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and
transfer of materials, loading and unloading operation, control of plant site
run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment,
measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.32 NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING SLUG LOADING.
   (A)   All categorical and non-categorical industrial users shall immediately
notify the environmental officer of all discharges, including, but not limited
to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, or slug loadings as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(b),
that could cause problems to the POTW by the industrial user. This notification
shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall,
unless waived by the environmental officer, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.33 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   If a person can establish that an event, which would otherwise be a
violation of this chapter, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit
issued pursuant to this chapter, or other Federal, state, or local law, was
caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the
event is not a violation.
   (B)   Conditions necessary for a demonstration of affirmative defense. An
industrial user who wishes to establish an affirmative defense shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operation logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   The event that resulted in a violation occurred and the industrial
user can identify the cause(s) of the violation as being solely an act of God,
war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      (3)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the
environmental officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation (if
this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided
within five days);
         (a)   A description of the event that resulted in a violation and the
cause of noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or plans to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance. Any verbal notice must include all of the
information set out in (a) through (c) above.
   (C)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user
seeking to establish an affirmative defense shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Reviewability of agency consideration. In the exercise of
prosecutorial discretion, the environmental officer will review any claims of
an affirmative defense. No determinations made in the course of his/her review
shall constitute final action subject to judicial review. Industrial users will
have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of an
affirmative defense only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   User responsibility. The industrial user shall control production or
all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost,
or fails.
(Ord. 160726-A, passed 7-26-2016)
§ 56.34 NOTIFICATION OF DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTES.
   (A)   If the permittee knows in advance of the need to discharge of a
hazardous waste, the permittee shall submit prior written notice, at least ten
days before the date of the discharge of a hazardous waste, to NTMWD and the
city. If the permittee does not know in advance of the discharge of a hazardous
waste, the permittee shall immediately notify NTMWD and the city and submit a
written notice to NTMWD within five days of the discharge. The notification
shall identify the hazardous waste discharged and the amount of the hazardous
waste discharged.
   (B)   In addition to the reporting requirements set out in division (A)
above, industrial users shall notify the environmental officer, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which,
if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. Part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in
40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall
also contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
Industrial users shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after
the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste commences. Any
notification under this division need be submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be
submitted under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this
section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring
requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b), (d) and (e).
   (C)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (B) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. § 261.30(d) and § 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional information.
   (D)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
environmental officer, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and
the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (E)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that is has a program in place to reduce the

   (A)    Upon the impoundment of an abandoned motor vehicle under §
71.02, the Department of Public Safety shall notify, not later than the tenth
day after taking the motor vehicle into custody, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, the last known registered owner of the motor vehicle and all
lien holders of records, pursuant to the Certificate of Title Act, being Tex.
Trans. Code, Ch. 501, or Parks and Wildlife Code, Ch. 31, that the vehicle has
been taken into custody.
   (B)   The notice shall describe the year, make, model and vehicle
identification number of the abandoned motor vehicle, set forth the location of
the facility where the motor vehicle is being held, inform the owner and any
lien holders of their right to reclaim the motor vehicle within 20 days after
the date of the notice upon payment of all towing, preservation and storage
charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody, or garage keepers'
charges if notice is pursuant to the provisions hereof dealing with garage
keepers and abandoned motor vehicles.
   (C)   The notice shall state that the failure of the owner or lien holder to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within the time provided shall be
deemed a waiver by the owner and all lien holders of all right, title and
interest in the vehicle and their consent to the sale of the abandoned motor
vehicle at a public auction.
      (1)   If the identity of the last registered owner cannot be determined,
or if the registration contains no address for the owner; or, if it is
impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and addresses of
all lien holders, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general
circulation in the area where the motor vehicle was abandoned shall be
sufficient to meet all requirements of notice pursuant to this chapter. The
notice by publication can contain multiple listings of abandoned motor
vehicles. Any such notice shall be published within the time requirements
prescribed for notice by certified mail, and shall have the same contents
required for a notice by certified mail. The consequences and effect of failure
to reclaim an abandoned motor vehicle shall be as set forth in a valid notice
given pursuant to this chapter.
      (2)   The Department of Public Safety, or an agent of the Department of
Public Safety, that takes custody of an abandoned motor vehicle is entitled to
reasonable storage fees for:
         (a)   A period of not more than ten days beginning on the day the
Department of Public Safety or an agent of the Department of Public Safety
takes custody and continuing through the day the Department of Public Safety or
an agent of the Department of Public Safety mails notice as provided by this
chapter; and
         (b)   A period beginning on the day after the day the Department of
Public Safety or an agent of the Department of Public Safety mails notice and
continuing through the day any accrued charges are paid and the motor vehicle
is removed.
      (3)   If an abandoned motor vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided
for in division (C)(1) above, the Department of Public Safety shall sell the
abandoned motor vehicle at a public auction. Proper notice of the public
auction shall be given, and in cases of garage keepers' liens, the garage
keeper shall be notified of the time and place of such auction. The purchaser
of the motor vehicle shall take title to the motor vehicle free and clear of
all liens and claims of ownership, shall receive a sales receipt from the
Department of Public Safety and shall be entitled to register the purchased
vehicle and receive a certificate of title. The Department of Public Safety
shall reimburse itself from the proceeds of the sale for the expenses of the
auction, and costs of towing, preserving, and storing the vehicle that resulted
from placing the abandoned motor vehicle in custody, and all notice and
publication costs incurred pursuant to division (C)(1) above. Any remainder
from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or
entitled lien holder for 90 days, and then shall be deposited in a special fund
that shall remain available for the payment of auction, towing, preserving,
storage and all notice and publication costs that result from placing other
abandoned motor vehicles in custody, whenever the proceeds from a sale of such
other abandoned motor vehicles are insufficient to meet those expenses and
costs.
      (4)   (a)   A motor vehicle left for more than ten days in a storage
facility operated for commercial purposes after notice is given by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner and to any lien
holder of record under the Certificate of Title Act, being Tex. Trans. Code,
Ch. 501, to pick up the vehicle, or for more than ten days after a period when
under a contract the vehicle was to remain on the premises of the storage
facility, or a motor vehicle left for more than ten days in a storage facility
by someone other than the registered owner or by a person authorized to have
possession of the motor vehicle under a contract of use, service, storage or
repair, is considered an abandoned motor vehicle, and shall be reported by the
garage keeper to the Department of Public Safety. If the notice to the owner or
a lien holder is returned by the post office unclaimed, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the
vehicle was left in storage is sufficient notice.
         (b)   If a garage keeper or storage facility acquires possession of a
motor vehicle for a purpose other than repair, the garage keeper or storage
facility is entitled to towing, preservation and notification charges and to
reasonable storage fees, in addition to storage fees earned pursuant to
contract, for a maximum of ten days only until notification is mailed to the
last known registered owner and all lien holders of record as provided by
division (C)(1) above. After the notice is mailed, storage fees may continue
until the vehicle is removed and all accrued charges are paid. A garage keeper
who fails to report the possession of an abandoned motor vehicle to the
Department of Public Safety within ten days after it becomes abandoned may no
longer claim reimbursement for storage of the vehicle.
         (c)   The Department of Public Safety, upon receipt of a report from a
garage keeper of the possession of a vehicle considered abandoned under the
provisions of this section shall follow the notification procedures provided in
this chapter, except that custody of the vehicle shall remain with the garage
keeper until after compliance with the notification requirements. A fee of $2
shall accompany the report of the garage keeper to the Department of Public
Safety receiving the report and used to defray the cost of notification or
other cost incurred in the disposition of an abandoned motor vehicle.
         (d)   An abandoned motor vehicle left in a storage facility and not
reclaimed after notice is sent in the manner provided in this chapter shall be
taken into custody by the Department of Public Safety and sold in the manner
provided by division (C)(3) above. The proceeds of a sale under this section
shall first be applied to the garage keeper's charges for servicing, storage
and repair, but as compensation for the expense incurred by the Department of
Public Safety in placing the vehicle in custody and the expense of auction, the
Department of Public Safety shall retain 2% of the gross proceeds of the sale
of each vehicle auctioned, unless the gross proceeds are less than $10. If the
gross proceeds are less than $10, the Department of Public Safety shall retain
the $10 to defray expenses of custody and auction. Surplus proceeds remaining
from an auction shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(3) above.
         (e)   Except for the termination or limitation of claim for storage
for failure to report an abandoned motor vehicle, nothing in this section may
be construed to impair any lien of a garage keeper under the laws of this
state.
         (f)   A person charging fees under division (C)(2) above commits an
offense if the person charges a storage fee for a period of time not
authorized. An offense under this division is punishable by a fine of not less
than $200 nor more than $500.

protection manager within 45 days after the termination or transfer, unless an
extension of time is required by the establishment and granted, in writing, by
the regulatory authority.
      (5)   Food protection management certification shall be valid for not

a valid certificate of occupancy for the building in which the establishment is
located.
   (B)   An inspection of a food service establishment shall be performed

§ 152.02 STANDARDS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ALTERNATIVE TOWER STRUCTURE. Human-made trees, clock towers; bell
steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that
camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
      ANTENNA. Any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio or
television communications through the sending and/or receiving of
electromagnetic waves.
      FAA. The Federal Aviation Administration.
      FCC. The Federal Communications Commission.
      GOVERNING AUTHORITY. The governing authority of the county/city.
      HEIGHT. When referring to a tower or other structure, the distance
measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other
structure, even if the highest point is an antenna.
      PREEXISTING TOWERS AND ANTENNAS. The meaning set forth in division (B)(4)
below.
      PUBLIC OFFICER. The Building Official of the governing authority.
      TOWER. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the
purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice
towers, guy towers or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television
transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular
telephone towers, alternative tower structures and the like.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this
chapter shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are
installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each
zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures
shall not apply to towers and antennas.
      (2)   Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned,
leased or otherwise controlled by the governing authority, shall be exempt from
the requirements of this chapter, provided a license or lease authorizing such
antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority.
      (3)   Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This chapter shall not govern
any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height
and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station
operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
      (4)   Pre-existing towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna on for which
a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this chapter
shall not be required to meet the requirements of this chapter, other than the
requirements of divisions (C)(5) and (6) below. Any such towers or antennas
shall be referred to in this chapter as pre-existing towers or pre-existing
antennas.
   (C)   General guidelines and requirements.
      (1)   Purpose; goals. The purpose of this chapter is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are
to:
         (a)   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and
minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
         (b)   Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower
sites;
         (c)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
         (d)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
         (e)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently.
      (2)   Principal or accessory use.
         (a)   Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or
accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same
lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on the lot.
         (b)   For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower
or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not
limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
         (c)   Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to
constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
      (3)   Inventory of existing sites.
         (a)   Each applicant for an antenna and or tower shall provide to the
Planning and Zoning Commission an inventory of its existing towers that are
either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter
mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location,
height, and design of each tower.
         (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may share such information
with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use
permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas
within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however that the
Planning and Zoning Commission is not, by sharing the information, in any way
representing or warranting that the sites are available or suitable.
      (4)   Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this division
shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas,
governed by this chapter; provided, however, that the governing authority may
waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this chapter are
better served thereby.
         (a)   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so
as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
         (b)   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural
setting and built environment.
         (c)   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower,
the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a
neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of
the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
         (d)   Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the
FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing
authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design
that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
         (e)   All tower lighting shall conform to Chapter 98, “Outdoor
Lighting/Dark Sky Ordinance”, as amended.
      (5)   Federal requirements.
         (a)   All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations
of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the
authority to regulate towers and antennas.
         (b)   If the standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of
the towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring the towers and
antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six
months of the effective date of the standards and regulations, unless a more
stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency.
         (c)   Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the
revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of
the tower or antenna at the owners expense.
      (6)   Building codes; safety standards.
         (a)   To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a
tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained
in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that
are published by the Electronics Industries Association, as amended from time
to time.
         (b)   If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a
tower fails to comply with the codes and standards and constitutes a danger to
persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower,
the owner shall have 30 days to bring the tower into compliance with the
standards.
         (c)   If the owner fails to bring the tower into compliance within the
30 days, the governing authority may remove the tower at the owner’s expense.
   (D)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   General. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted
uses and shall not require administrative review or a special use permit.
Nevertheless, all the uses shall comply with divisions (C)(4), (5) and (6)
above and all other applicable ordinances.
      (2)   Specific permitted uses. The following uses are specifically
permitted:
         (a)   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of
additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with the

residence a distance equal to the height of the tower;
         (b)   Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a
tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other free-
standing nonresidential structure) that is 50 feet in height or greater, so
long as the additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the
existing structure; and
         (c)   Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so
long as the addition of the antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of
the existing tower and the existing tower is not a pre-existing tower;
provided, however, that the specific permitted use shall not include the
placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in
connection with the antenna.
   (E)   Administrative approvals.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may administratively approve

structure;
         (b)   Installing an antenna on an existing tower of any height,
including a pre-existing tower and further including the placement of
additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with the
antenna, so long as the addition of the antenna adds no more than 20 feet to
the height of the existing structure;
         (c)   Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district
other than industrial or heavy commercial that in the judgment of the Planning
and Zoning Commission is in conformity with the goals set forth in division (C)
(1) above;
         (d)   Locating any tower in a zoning district other than industrial or
heavy commercial, provided a licensed professional engineer certifies, the
tower can structurally accommodate the number of shared users proposed by the

   (F)   Special use permits.
      (1)   General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of
special use permits:
         (a)   If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under division
(D) above, or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to division
(E) above, then a special use permit shall be required for the construction of
a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts.
         (b)   In granting a special use permit, the governing authority may
impose conditions to the extent the governing authority concludes the
conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower
on adjoining properties.
         (c)   Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant
submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a
licensed professional engineer.
      (2)   Information required. Each applicant requesting a special use
permit under this chapter shall provide a scaled site plan and a scaled
elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations and other
documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing
the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information
concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements,
setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses and other
information deemed by the governing authority to be necessary to assess
compliance with this chapter.
      (3)   Factors considered in granting special use permits. The governing
authority shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue
a special use permit, although the governing authority may waive or reduce the
burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if the governing
authority concludes that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby:
         (a)   Height of the proposed tower;
         (b)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;

structure can accommodate the applicant’s proposed antenna. Evidence submitted
to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the
applicant’s proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
         (a)   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area required to meet applicant’s engineering requirements;
         (b)   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant’s engineering requirements;
         (c)   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant’s proposed antenna and related equipment;
         (d)   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed antenna;
         (e)   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable; and/or
         (f)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
      (5)   Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation
requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special use
permit is required; provided, however, that the governing authority may, reduce
the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this chapter
would be better served thereby:
         (a)   Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the
tower from any off-site residential structure;
         (b)   Towers, guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements; and
         (c)   In zoning districts other than industrial or heavy commercial
zoning districts, towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within

less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate
anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive
the requirements. as it deems appropriate.
      (7)   Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required;
provided, however, that the governing authority may waive the requirements if
the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby:
         (a)   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent
residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip
at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound;
         (b)   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether; and
         (c)   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
   (G)   Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
      (1)   Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period
of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of the antenna or
tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing
authority notifying the owner of the abandonment.

event later than 24 hours after interruption becomes known. The cable operator
must begin action to correct other service problems the next business day after
notification of the service problem.
         (c)   The appointment window alternatives for installations, service
calls and other installation activities will be either a specific time or, at
maximum, a four-hour time block during normal business hours. (The operator may
schedule service calls and other installation activities outside of normal

seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or upgrade of the cable system.
         SERVICE INTERRUPTION. The loss of picture or sound on one or more
cable channels.
   (B)   Customers will be notified of any changes in rates, programming
services or channel positions as soon as possible in writing. Notice must be
given to subscribers a minimum of 30 days in advance of the changes if the
change is within the control of the cable operator. In addition, the cable

service change. The notice shall state the precise amount of any rate change
and briefly explain in readily understandable fashion the cause of the rate
change (e.g., inflation, change in external costs or the addition/ deletion of
channels). When the change involves the addition or deletion of channels, each
channel added or deleted must be separately identified. For purposes of the
carriage of digital broadcast signals, the operator need only identify for
subscribers, the television signal added and not whether that signal may be
multiplexed during certain day parts.
   (D)   A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of any
increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or associated
equipment at least 30 days before any proposed increase is effective. The
notice should include the name and address of the local franchising authority.

and rate changes to subscribers, the operator may provide the notice using any
reasonable written means at its sole discretion.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a cable operator
shall not be required to provide prior notice of any rate change that is the
result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee or any other fee, tax, assessment or
charge of any kind imposed by any federal agency, state or franchising
authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber.
   (G)   Products and services offered:
      (1)   Prices and options for programming services and conditions of
subscription to programming and other services;
      (2)   Installation and service maintenance policies;
      (3)   Instructions on how to use the cable service;
      (4)   Channel positions of programming carried on the system; and
      (5)   Billing and complaint procedures, including the address and
telephone number of the local franchise authority’s cable office.
   (H)   Subscribers shall be advised of the procedures for resolution of
complaints about the quality of the televisions signal delivered by the cable
system operator, including the address of the responsible officer of the local
franchising authority.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance
Act, Tex. Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Heath, Texas does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 080902A, passed 9-2-2008; Ord. 221213A, passed 12-13-2022)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Heath, Texas are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 080902A, passed 9-2-2008; Ord. 221213A, passed 12-13-2022)
§ 155.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 080902A, passed 9-2-2008; Ord. 221213A, passed 12-13-2022)
§ 155.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 080902A, passed 9-2-2008; Ord. 200825A, 8-25-2020; Ord. 221213A, passed

issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed.
      (2)   The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully

§ 155.29 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Appeal Board, as established by the community, shall hear and
render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
   (C)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in § 155.58(B) have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (§
155.03).
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in
divisions (A) through (I) above are met, and (ii) the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 155.51 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   (A)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   (B)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 080902A, passed 9-2-2008; Ord. 221213A, passed 12-13-2022)
§ 155.52 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has
been provided as set forth in §§
155.07,
155.27(H), or §
155.53(C), the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this division (A) as proposed in
§
155.28(A)(1), is satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this division (B). A record of such certification which includes the
specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood
waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject
to flooding shall be provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters.
   (D   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a
community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites (i)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a
result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones Al-30,
AH and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
this division (D) be elevated so that either:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the
base flood elevation, or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   (5)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM either (i) be on
the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and
ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of §
155.28(A), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured
homes” in division (D) above. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use
if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.

§ 155.53 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with §§
155.02,
155.03, and
155.04.
   (B)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain
development permit requirements of §§
155.08,
155.28, and
155.51 through
155.55.
   (C)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever
is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to §§
155.07 or
155.27(H).
   (D)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   (E)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.

§ 155.54 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
155.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable,
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to at least two
feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as
high as the depth number specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least
two feet if no depth number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to at least two
feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as
high as the depth number specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least
two feet if no depth number is specified); or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base
flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
155.28 are satisfied.
   (D)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.

§ 155.55 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
155.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit
encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes
all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.

   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this court
order and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court
order or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500 for each violation, and in addition shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall
prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.

entire subdivision at smaller scale with block numbers and street names, shall
be shown on one of the sheets or on a separate sheet of the same size.
   (D)   After the final plat has been approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the plat shall be submitted to the City Council for approval.
   (E)   (1)   The engineer or surveyor responsible for the plat shall place
permanent monuments at each corner of the boundary survey of the subdivision
and at the center line intersection point of all streets. These monuments shall
be a concrete post, six inches in diameter and two feet long, or other such
type of monuments as shall be approved by the City Engineer and/or City
Manager. The precise point of intersection is to be indented on the top of the
monument. Block corners shall be in reference to these monuments and the
bearing and distances of the reference lines filed in written form with the
City Engineer and/or City Manager. Top of monuments shall be set to pavement
grade in permanent type pavement, two inches below grade in nonpermanent type
pavements and flush with existing ground level in non-pavement areas. Locations
of monuments shall be shown on the final plat.
      (2)   The accurate location, material and size of all monuments shall be
approved by the City Engineer. For all subdivision or developments, global
positioning systems (GPS) shall be used to establish the location of a minimum
of two corners of the subdivision. The establishing of the location of one
additional monument by GPS may be required for each additional 20 acres or
fraction thereof for developments that are larger than 20 acres. These
monuments shall be tied vertically and horizontally to the city’s existing GPS
coordinate system. All GPS coordinates shall be determined such that the
maximum error does not exceed 0.05 feet. Elevations and the location of all
other subdivision corner monuments shall be established to at least third order
accuracy.
      (3)   GPS monuments shall be constructed of a four-inch diameter
reinforced concrete monument at least six feet deep set flush with the ground.
A brass or aluminum disc shall be set in the top of the monument and shall have
the monument number, elevation and registration number of the surveyor stamped
in the disc. The surveyor shall determine the Texas State Plan Coordinates and
elevation of the monument and file a survey report with the city showing this
information.
   (F)   An owner and/or developer can with justifiable reason obtain approval
of a section of an addition for which tentative or conditional approval was
obtained on a preliminary plat provided he or she meets all the requirements of
this chapter with reference to the section in the same manner as is required
for a complete addition. In the event a subdivision and the final plat thereof
is approved by the City Council in sections, each final plat of each section is
to carry the name of the entire subdivision, but is to be distinguished from
each other section by a distinguishing subtitle. Block number shall run
consecutively throughout the entire subdivision, even though the subdivision
may be finally approved in sections. All costs which the city may incur because
of this development may be recovered by the city from the developer with the
approval of the City Council.
   (G)   The owner shall record the approved final plat within 365 days of the
date of approval by the City Council. If the property owner fails to record the
approved final plat within the period as contained in division (A)(13) above,
approval of the final plat shall lapse, as well as any preliminary plat or
master plat for the same land. Thereafter, the subdivider or property owner
shall be required to submit a new master plat or preliminary plat application,
as required by this chapter, subject to all zoning and subdivision standards
then in effect, for the land subject to the expired final plat.
      (1)   Thirty days prior to the lapse of approval for a final plat, the
property owner may petition the City Council to extend or reinstate the
approval. The petition shall be considered at a public meeting of the Council.
      (2)   In determining whether to grant such request, the Council shall
take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to
comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, the extent to
which the property owner agrees to abide by newly adopted subdivision
regulations, and any changed conditions in the surrounding area which would
make an extension undesirable. The Council shall extend its approval of the
plat, or deny the request.
      (3)   The Council shall not extend the period that a final plat approval
is valid to more than one year from the date of its original approval by the
Council.
      (4)   At any time following the lapse of approval of a final plat, a
property may request, and the Council may approve, at its discretion, a
reinstatement of the final plat. The Council shall reinstate a final plat only
when it determines that it would be in the public interest do to so to avoid
unnecessary review of a new plat application, and when the pattern of
development proposed by the plat would not be the detriment of any nearby area
or the general development of the city.
   (H)   A final plat approved after May 11, 2000 and prior to the effective
date of this section, that has not been recorded by the effective date of this
section, and to which any other expiration provision does not apply, shall
expire the later of two years from the date the plat was approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission or at 5:00 p.m. on September 1, 2005, unless the
property owner can demonstrate that:
      (1)   Costs for development of the land subject to the final plat,
including but not limited to the costs associated with roadway, utility and
other infrastructure facilities designed to serve the land in whole or in part,
but exclusive of land acquisition costs, were incurred in the aggregate amount
of 5% of the most recent appraised market value of the land subject to the
final plat;
      (2)   Fiscal security was posted after approval of the final plat to
ensure performance of an obligation required for all or a part of the land
subject to the approved final plat; or utility connection fees or impact fees
for all or part of the land subject to the approved final plat were paid;
      (3)   Expiration of a final plat pursuant to this section results in
automatic termination of any approved master plat or preliminary plat for the
same land; and
      (4)   The City Council may grant an extension of the time for expiration
of the approved final plat for a period not to exceed one year from the date of
approval of the application, provided that a request for extension is made in
writing at least 30 days before the final plat expires. Every request for
extension shall include a statement of the reasons why the expiration date
should be extended. The Council may grant a request for an extension taking
into account the reasons for the requested extension, the ability of the
applicant to comply with any conditions attached to approval of the final plat,
whether extension is likely to result in timely completion of the project, and
the extent to which any newly adopted regulations should be applied to the
proposed subdivision.

(2005 Code, § 13-1-14) (Ord. passed 4-21-2005)
§ 158.15 STREET IMPROVEMENTS AND OVERSIZING.
   (A)   (1)   When a proposed subdivision of land abuts on both sides of an
existing substandard road, or on one side of the road, being substandard
according to the then existing current City of Heath standard specifications,
the developer shall be required to improve the existing road, including
sidewalks, to bring the same to City of Heath standards, or to replace it with
a standard city street at no cost to the City of Heath other than as set out in
the cost sharing policy of the city in effect at the time of approval of the
final plat. If the proposed subdivision is located along only one side of a
substandard road, and when in the City Council’s judgment, it is not feasible
to reconstruct the substandard road at the time of development of the
subdivision, the City Council (Planning and Zoning Commission) may permit the
developer to pay into escrow an amount equal to 115% of the developer’s share
of the cost of said improvements as a condition of the approval of the final
plat of the subdivision. If the proposed subdivision is located along a state
road, as herein designated, which is considered substandard, the developer
shall be required to escrow funds for the cost of improvements for curb and
gutter, sidewalks and storm drainage on nonresidential subdivisions.
      (2)   Developers of residential subdivisions along state roads shall be
required to escrow funds for 50% of the estimated cost of the required road
improvements applicable to that subdivision. State roads shall include FM 740,
FM 549, FM 550, FM 1140 and FM 3097. The amount of escrow shall be as
determined by the City Engineer or his or her designated representative and
shall be payable prior to construction of the subdivision streets and
utilities. When funds have been provided and placed in escrow with the City of
Heath for the development of a substandard road, the road is reconstructed by a
party other than the escrowing developer and at no cost to the City of Heath,
the escrowed funds and accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded to the
developer after completion and acceptance of the improvements. Where in its
judgment, the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served and
the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be substantially
injured, upon recommendation by the City Planning and Zoning Commission, the
City Council may, in specific cases, at a regular meeting of the City Council,
and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, authorize special
exceptions to these regulations in order to permit reasonable changes to these
regulations in order to permit reasonable development and improvement of
property where the literal enforcement of these regulations would result in an
unnecessary hardship.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions (A)(1) and (2) above,
if a proposed subdivision contains five acres or less but at least one acre and
only one single-family residence is to be located on the tract, the City
Council may consider a reduction in the street and drainage fee otherwise due
by dividing the proposed fees by the land area in the proposed subdivision.
Tracts of land greater than five acres may be considered for reduction in fees
when, at the determination of the Council, the land is not suitable or subject
to being further subdivided.
   (B)   All new roads within proposed subdivisions shall, at a minimum be
built to a width and design which will adequately serve that subdivision. In
addition, when required by the city in the interest of the community, the
developer may be required to build larger streets to the width shown on the
Thoroughfare Plan. If more than 48 feet (back of curb to back of curb) is
constructed the city will reimburse the developer for the excess width when
funds become available, unless the additional width was required by the City
Engineer or traffic planner to adequately serve the needs of that subdivision.
Streets which dead-end at power lines, railroads or similar right-of-way, shall
be constructed in right-of-way for half the distance across the rights-of-way.
Where streets are adjacent to undeveloped land and the property line is
normally the centerline of the street, the developer shall provide right-of-way
of sufficient width and shall construct paving a minimum width of 31-street
width feet, if deemed necessary by the City Engineer or traffic planner. If the
city in the interest of the community, requires the subdivider to construct
more than 31-street width feet, the city will reimburse the cost of the excess
width to the developer who installed the paving, at the actual cost of
construction, with no reimbursement for additional right-of-way which required
to construct the additional paving in excess of 31-street width feet as funds
are available. No reimbursement will be made, however, when the City Engineer
or traffic planner determines that the excess width is required to serve that
subdivision. When, in the City Council’s judgment, it is not feasible to
construct the street and/or railroad crossing at the time of the development of
the subdivision, escrow for the development of the subdivision, escrow for the
developer’s portion of the cost may be provided in accordance with this
section. In the event the street and/or railroad crossing has been constructed
or is being constructed by others, the developer shall pay his or her pro-rata
share of the improvements. Escrow or pro-rata shall be payable prior to
construction of streets and utilities.
   (C)   When reimbursing the developer for oversize development costs, the
City of Heath shall pay for a maximum engineering fee of 6% of the construction
reimbursement.
   (D)   If the improvements of the road or street do not occur within 20 years
from the date the money is so placed on deposit with the city, the money,
including any earned interest thereon, shall be returned to the property owner
of record at that time.
   (E)   Should the city establish an assessment program for street
improvements on any road within the city, any funds already placed in escrow
for road improvements to the street as required by this section shall be
credited toward the property owner of record at the time of assessment.

§ 158.16 OFF-SITE ACCESS ROADWAYS.
   (A)   Dependent upon the circumstances of a particular subdivision where
access is not deemed adequate by the City Council, the Council may require the
developer to provide and construct off-site access roadways which conform to
the street layout standards as provided for in §
158.06 above. If the access is provided, the developer and city shall enter
into a facilities agreement prior to final plat approval, for the construction
of the access roadway. The agreement shall contain engineering cost estimates,
the number of square feet in the proposed roadway, any pro rata scheduled plus
any other matter deemed appropriate by the parties.
   (B)   For any subsequent subdivision utilizing such facilities, a facilities
agreement shall be required between the city and any subsequent developer. Any
costs due prior developers as determined by the city’s engineer, consistent
with the city’s policies on thoroughfare improvements shall be prorated as the
use by the new subdivision bears to the amount due. The prorated amounts will
be made a part of any subsequent facilities agreement, collected by the city,
and repaid to the original developer making the improvements. All the
reimbursements or prorations shall be based on the actual cost of the
improvements at the time of their construction. The original developer shall
provide the city with the acceptable documentation of actual construction cost
from which calculation of reimbursable amounts will be made for inclusion in
the facilities agreement.
(2005 Code, § 13-1-16) (Ord. passed 4-21-2005)
§ 158.17 SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Sidewalks; general requirements.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be provided on all streets in areas zoned for one-
or two-family residential development and on all streets designated on the
adopted master thoroughfare plan. The city may require sidewalks in other
locations. All required sidewalks shall be constructed by the builder at the
time the lot is developed.
      (2)   Sidewalks along streets that are adjacent to common areas shall be
built by the developer during development of the subdivision. If the sidewalk
is adjacent to a drainage facility or creek, the developer shall install a
barrier as prescribed by the Building Official or City Engineer.
      (3)   If, at the time the property is developed, it is determined to be
unfeasible to construct the sidewalks as required, the builder shall pay into
escrow the estimated cost of the sidewalks. The amount of escrow shall be as
determined by the City Engineer or his or her designated representative, and
shall be payable prior to construction of any buildings or other improvements.
Where in its judgment, the public convenience and welfare will be substantially
served and the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be
substantially injured, upon recommendation by the City Planning and Zoning
Commission, the City Council may, in specific cases, at a regular meeting of
the City Council, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards,
authorize special exceptions to these regulations in order to permit reasonable
development and improvement of property where the literal enforcement of these
regulations would result in an unnecessary hardship.
      (4)   In the event that an existing subdivision has been substantially
developed (50% completion) without the construction of sidewalks, an owner of
property constructing a residence in that subdivision may petition the Building
Official for a waiver of the requirements of division (A)(1) above. The
Building Official shall grant the waiver unless the Building Official deems
that a waiver would endanger the safety of the general public or would
otherwise be inconsistent with future development in or around that
subdivision.
   (B)   Sidewalk construction.
      (1)   Size and location. All sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide
or in conformance with the Pathways Plan, whichever is greater, and shall be
located between the curb or grade line of the street and the right of way line,
no closer than two feet to the curb or grade line. The City Engineer or
Building Official may approve an alteration of the alignment so that the
sidewalk meanders within the area between the curb and right of way line.
      (2)   Concrete required. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete and
shall be reinforced with bars. Construction specifications for sidewalks shall
be maintained in the engineering standards of the city.
      (3)   Fire hydrant location. Where a sidewalk is to be constructed and a
fire hydrant would be located within the forms, the forms shall curve around
the fire hydrant so that the walk misses the fire hydrant by a minimum distance
of one foot. A transition of ten feet is required in and out of curved areas.
      (4)   Drainage. All sidewalks shall be built at an elevation that will
not impede or be otherwise detrimental to proper lot drainage, with natural
grade preferred.
   (C)   Wheel-chair access ramps.
      (1)   Location. A wheel-chair access ramp must be constructed at any
point where a proposed sidewalk intersects a city street with the exception of
walks leading from the street to the door of a residence. Access ramps must be

(Ord. 200825A, passed 8-25-2020)
PARKLAND DEDICATION AND DEVELOPMENT
§ 158.55 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This subchapter is adopted to provide open space and recreational
areas in the form of parks as a function of subdivision and site development in
the city and its extra-territorial jurisdiction (ETJ). This subchapter is
enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city granted under the
Texas Constitution and the statutes of the state, including, but not by way of
limitation, Tex. Local Gov’t. Code, Ch. 212 as may be amended from time to
time.
   (B)   It is hereby declared by the City Council that open space and
recreational areas in the form of trails, parks, and preserves are necessary
for the health and welfare of the residents of the city, and that the only
adequate procedure to provide for parks is by integrating such requirements
into the procedure for planning and developing property or subdivisions in the
city and its ETJ to accommodate the associated and proportionate impact on the
parks and recreation system, whether such development consists of subdivision,
new construction on vacant land, or rebuilding and remodeling of structures on
previously developed property.
   (C)   Parks provide for a variety of indoor and outdoor recreational and
healthy living opportunities and are located in various locations throughout
the city. The land area of the city being less than 15 square miles shall be
prima facie evidence that any park located therein is within a convenient
distance from any residence located therein. The primary cost of purchasing or
acquiring, developing, and improving parks shall be borne by the landowners of
residential property or projects who, by reason of the proximity of their
property to such parks, are the primary beneficiaries of such facilities.
   (D)   Due to the city’s small size, a typical park in the city is designed
to serve the needs of residents from the entire community no matter where the
park is or will be located in the city. Parks serve both active and passive
leisure and recreation needs of residents and their visitors, in addition to
serving the essential purposes of providing open space to maintain the rural
character of the city as desired by the community. The purchase, acquisition,
development, and improvement of the basic infrastructure and facilities for
parks in the city are based upon the demand from the residents they are
intended to serve.
   (E)   Recognizing that there are different sizes, scales, and types of park
facilities, the required level of service contained herein has been designed
based on the smallest of park facilities at existing level of service, a
neighborhood park of two to ten acres, to meet the basic infrastructure and
facilities standard. Any fees collected per these requirements can, however, be
utilized in the purchase or acquisition of parkland, development, and/or
improvement of any size or scale park facility in the city as planned for or
recommended in the Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan (expressly or via
intent), as may be amended from time to time, which is hereby adopted by
reference and incorporated herein for all purposes.
   (F)   Therefore, the following requirements are adopted to affect the
purposes stated above.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.56 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPER. Landowner(s) of the subject property containing a proposed
development or project.
   DWELLING UNIT. Any building or portion thereof, which contains living
facilities, including provisions for sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation
as required by this code, for not more than one family. DWELLING UNITS include
temporary or quasi-dwelling units such as suites within hotel or motel type
uses, suites within senior care or assisted care type facilities, accessory
DWELLING UNITS, and mobile or semi-mobile living facilities since they all
house people who will impact the parks and recreation system.
   MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. Structure(s) or projects with more than one
DWELLING UNIT on one lot or mixed-use structures containing at least one
DWELLING UNIT. Includes two-family or duplex residential. Includes group or
community home type uses. For purposes of this subchapter, structures that have
restricted usage of one person per room (documentation must be provided with
building permit application), dwelling unit count shall be assessed based on
the number of rooms available for residential living, divided by the persons
per household number stipulated in Appendix II to Ordinance 180327B, which is
incorporated herein by reference, to ascertain the number of dwelling units to
be utilized in determining dedication and/or fees required. MULTI-FAMILY
RESIDENTIAL projects shall be assessed parkland fees and pay parkland fees of
this subchapter prior to the issuance of a building permit.
   PARK. Includes a variety of PARKS, trails, open spaces, natural preserves,
gathering spaces, and recreational opportunities and facilities that are open
and accessible to the general public and are located within a convenient
distance of the residences to be served thereby.
   RESIDENTIAL USES. Includes SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL and MULTI-FAMILY
RESIDENTIAL uses.
   SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. Structure(s) with one dwelling unit on one lot,
not to include mixed-use or live-work structures. Any one proposed lot
containing only one proposed dwelling unit shall be assessed parkland fees and
pay parkland fees of this subchapter prior to filing an associated plat for
record.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.57 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter applies to a developer who subdivides or develops land for
residential uses located within the city or within its extra-territorial
jurisdiction.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.58 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The City Manager or his designee shall administer this subchapter
with certain review, recommendation, and approval authorities being assigned to
the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Park Board, and various city
departments as specified herein. Unless provided otherwise herein, action by
the city shall be by the City Council after consideration by the Park Board.
Any proposal considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission under this
subchapter shall have been reviewed by the Park Board and its recommendation
given to the Commission.
      (2)   Generally, the developer of property with residential uses must
address the following requirements pursuant to this subchapter: dedication of
land for park use or payment of a fee-in-lieu thereof and payment of a park
development fee for parks or construction of the park improvements to which
such fee relates. Requirements herein are based on actual or approved dwelling
units for an entire development or project. Increases or decreases in final
dwelling unit count may require an adjustment in fees paid or land dedicated.
If the actual number of dwelling units exceeds the original estimate,
additional parkland and additional park development fees may be required in
accordance with the requirements in this subchapter.
   (B)   Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan. The Parks, Recreation, and
Trails Master Plan, as may be amended by Council, is the park planning basis
for this subchapter. The city shall consider the need to regularly update the
Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan to ensure that the plan remains
current and provides an equitable, effective framework from which to pursue the
acquisition and development of public parks throughout the city.
   (C)   Fee calculations and updates.
      (1)   The schedule of fees and required land dedications, along with the
associated methodology and level of service standard, are attached to Ordinance
180327B as Appendix I, Appendix II, and Appendix III respectively and are
incorporated and made a part of this subchapter for all purposes by reference.
      (2)   A quantifiable and reasonable methodology was established to base
the parkland dedication requirements, fees-in-lieu of dedication, and parkland
development fees contained herein on data and levels of service relevant to the
city that are based on density as well as best practices. The park development
fee is calculated utilizing empirical details of how much the average
neighborhood park costs in the city based on the community feedback gathered in
the Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan and its associated analysis. The
methodology and fees shall be reviewed annually and updated on a regular basis
when warranted and updated in appendices contained in Ordinance 180327B.
      (3)   City staff shall submit, as directed by the Park Board or the City
Council, a fee derived from a parkland dedication requirement per person. The
parkland dedication requirement per person will be calculated from the
variables and formula(s) reflected in Appendix II to Ordinance 180327B. City
staff shall submit, as directed by the Park Board or the City Council, a fee
derived from a land cost per person. The land cost per person will be
calculated from the variables and formula(s) reflected in Appendix II to
Ordinance 180327B. City staff shall submit, as directed by the Park Board or
the City Council, a fee derived from a park development cost per person. The
park development cost per person will be calculated from the variables and
formula(s) reflected in Appendix II to Ordinance 180327B. The updated fees and
dedication will be presented for adoption by Council with the city's fee
schedule.
   (D)   Land dedication.
      (1)   The amount of land to be dedicated for parkland purposes shall be
as set forth in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B. The required dedication may be
met by payment of cash in lieu of land when permitted or required by other
provisions of this subchapter. The total amount of land dedicated for a
development or project shall be dedicated to the city in fee simple:
         (a)   Prior to the issuance of any building permits for multi-family
development on an associated plat or via separate instrument;
         (b)   Concurrently with the final plat for a single phase single-
family residential development, clearly labeled and dedicated as city parkland
(or with applicable notes as stipulated in this section for the ETJ);
         (c)   For a multi-phased single-family residential development, the
entire park(s) shall be either platted concurrently with the plat of the first
phase of the development, clearly labeled and dedicated as city parkland (or
with applicable notes as stipulated in this section for the ETJ); or
         (d)   The developer may provide the city with financial security
against the future dedication by providing a bond, irrevocable letter of
credit, or other alternative financial guarantee such as a cash deposit in the
amount equal to the number of acres parkland required and in a form acceptable
to the city. The amount of the financial guarantee shall be the amount of fee-
in-lieu of land dedication as set forth in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B. The
financial guarantee will be released to the developer, without interest, upon
the filing of the final plat for the phase that dedicates the required
parkland.
      (2)   For development located within the ETJ of the city, the dedication
requirements of this subchapter may be met through the creation of private
parkland in the same amount required as set forth in Appendix I to Ordinance
180327B, provided the developer enters into a written agreement that all such
private parkland be dedicated to the city at the time of full purpose
annexation into the city and provided that any plat related to such development
is inscribed with a notation regarding same.
      (3)   The obligation of an applicant/developer to dedicate parkland or
make payments or improvements in lieu thereof shall be in addition to and
independent of the requirements of the applicant/developer to provide open
space in accordance with a Planned Development (PD) zoning application. If the
open space in the proposed Planned Development (PD) exceeds two acres and is
dedicated and accepted by the city as public parkland, the required dedication
or payment may be reduced in applicable proportion.
   (E)   Fee-in-lieu of land. In lieu of dedicating parkland for parks, a
developer may request to meet some or all of the parkland dedication
requirements through payment of a fee-in-lieu thereof in the amounts set forth
in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B. Such fees shall be due prior to filing an
associated plat for record for single-family residential uses and prior to the
issuance of a building permit for multi-family residential uses.
   (F)   City approval. The Council shall have the final authority in
determining how much, if any, land or fee may be accepted in lieu of required
land dedication. The Council may, from time to time, require that a fee be
submitted in lieu of land dedication in amounts as set forth in Appendix I to
Ordinance 180327B. Likewise, the Council may, from time to time, require that
land be dedicated in amounts as set forth in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B,
and that no fee-in-lieu of land will be accepted.
   (G)   Approval process for parkland dedication.
      (1)   Land dedications equaling or exceeding two acres, and dedications
of floodplains and greenways.
         (a)   For any proposed required parkland dedication equaling or
exceeding two acres of land or equaling or exceeding payment of a fee-in-lieu
thereof, or for any proposed land dedication containing floodplain or greenway,
the developer must:
            1.   Obtain a recommendation from the Park Board; and
            2.   Obtain approval from the Council.
         (b)   Should a proposed dedication go before the Planning and Zoning
Commission as part of a required project approval, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider the recommendation from the Park Board and both
recommendations shall be forwarded to the Council for consideration.
      (2)   Criteria for consideration.
         (a)   For any proposed required parkland dedication equaling or
exceeding two acres of land or equaling or exceeding payment of a fee-in-lieu
thereof or for any proposed land dedication containing floodplain or greenway,
the Park Board and Council shall utilize the following criteria for considering
approval of the proposed parkland dedication:
            1.   The proposed plat shall clearly identify the proposed public
parkland to be dedicated;
            2.   The proposed dedication or fee shall provide a sufficient
amount of parkland in the area of the proposed development for required
parkland dedication;
            3.   Where the proposed dedication is insufficient for a park site
under existing park design standards, some or all of the dedication
requirements may be in the form of a fee in amounts as set forth in Appendix I
to Ordinance 180327B;
            4.   Determination of acceptability of a proposed parkland
dedication is based upon the Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan, as may
be amended from time to time and the criteria contained herein;
            5.   The proposed development of the park is at a minimum
consistent with the city’s level of service for neighborhood parks as set forth
in Appendix III to Ordinance 180327B, and in the Parks, Recreation, and Trails
Master Plan, as may be amended from time to time.
            6.   Land is usable and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan, the
Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan, and other approved public plans.
            7.   There is a level of service need in the immediate vicinity of
the proposed park area.
            8.   There is no nearby existing park that would be served with the
funds better or more by expansion or improvement.
            9.   Public access considerations.
      (3)   Development and maintenance of a park less than two acres in size
for public park purposes is impractical and does not allow for appropriate
improvements consistent with necessary level of service. Therefore, if fewer
than two acres-worth of dwelling units as specified in Appendix I to Ordinance
180327B, under land dedication are proposed by a plat for single-family
residential or a building permit for multi-family residential, the developer
shall pay the applicable cash in lieu of land dedication. An exception may be
considered if the dedication is voluntarily greater than two, acres will
increase the size of an existing park adjacent to the proposed parkland
dedication, will provide a beneficial trail connection or right- of-way, or
will provide a synergistic benefit not otherwise listed, at the discretion of
the Council.
      (4)   Park development fee. In addition to the land dedication
requirements for parks, there is a park development fee established herein
sufficient to develop parks in ways that meet the city's level of service as
determined in the Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan.
         (a)   The park development fee assessed to a developer, subject to
this subchapter, is as shown in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B. The process
for the approval and collection of park development fees shall be the same as
for the parkland dedication requirements to which the development relates, and
shall be processed simultaneously with the parkland dedication requirements.
         (b)   The city shall have the final authority in determining how much,
if any, land or fee may be accepted in lieu of required park development. The
city may, from time to time, require that a fee be submitted in lieu of park
development in amounts as set forth in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B.
Likewise, the city may, from time to time, require that parks be developed to a
level of service as reflected in Appendix II to Ordinance 180327B, and that no
fee-in-lieu of park development will be accepted.
      (5)   Construction of park improvements in lieu of park development fee.
A developer may elect to construct required park improvements in lieu of paying
the associated park development fee as set forth herein. In such event:
         (a)   A park site plan, developed in cooperation with the city staff,
must be reviewed and approved by the Park Board and City Council upon
submission of final plat for single family residential uses or upon application
for a building permit for multi-family residential uses, whichever is
applicable;
         (b)   Detailed plans and specifications for park improvements
hereunder shall be due and processed in accordance with the procedures and
requirements pertaining to public improvements for final plats and for building
permit issuance, whichever is applicable;
         (c)   All plans and specifications shall meet or exceed the city's
level of service standards and/or scale-specific intent as specified in the
Parks, Recreation, and Trails Master Plan and in Appendix II to Ordinance
180327B, as may be amended from time to time, and the criteria contained
herein, in effect at the time of the submission;
         (d)   If the improvements are constructed on land that has already
been dedicated to and/or is owned by the city, then the developer must post
payment and performance bonds to guarantee the payment to subcontractors and
suppliers and to guarantee the developer completes the work in accordance with
the approved plans, specifications, ordinances, and other applicable laws;
         (e)   The construction of all improvements, including any required
trails, must be completed in accordance with the requirements relating to the
construction of public improvements for final plats and issuance of building
permits, whichever is applicable. This includes guaranteeing performance in
lieu of completing the park improvements prior to final plat approval.
Notwithstanding any other applicable ordinances, park improvements should be
completed within two years from the date of the approval;
         (f)   Park development will be considered complete and a certificate
of completion will be issued after the following requirements are met:
            1.   Improvements have been constructed in accordance with the
approved plans;
            2.   All parkland upon which the improvements have been constructed
has been dedicated as required under this subchapter; and
            3.   All warranties as specified herein have been provided for any
equipment installed in the park as part of these improvements;
         (g)   Upon issuance of a certificate of completion, the developer
warrants the improvements for a period of two years; and
         (h)   The developer shall be liable for any costs required to complete
park development if:
            1.   Developer fails to complete the improvements in accordance
with the approved plans;
            2.   Developer fails to complete the improvements within the
required time frame; and/or
            3.   Developer fails to complete any warranty work.
      (6)   Standards for private parkland.
         (a)   A developer may submit an application to satisfy up to 100% of
the parkland dedication and development required for a development or project
by providing a public access and recreational easement rather than deeding the
land to the city in fee simple.
         (b)   In order to earn credit for private parkland, the park shall:
            1.   Provide signage visible from a right-of-way frontage to be
reviewed and approved through the application and consideration process, and
the sign shall state that the area, including any recreational amenities, is
open and available for public use, the park hours and city contact information,
and it must be posted at the park entrance or in a location visible to the
public;
            2.   Provide language in the public access and recreational
easement document or associated plat that specifies maintenance, capital
replacement, the right of the city to conduct safety inspections, future
construction rights, penalties and arrangements for lack of compliance, and
language that specifies that re-payment of the credits will be required via
alternate land or compensation for release of the easement; and
            3.   Provide design and features consistent with the guidelines and
requirements contained herein.
         (c)   The required dedication and development shall be calculated per
the requirements in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B, and then the proposal
shall be evaluated to determine the amount of parkland dedication and/or
development credit to be given using the following factors:
            1.   The presence of active recreational amenities including, but
not limited to, playscapes, sport courts, table game recreation, and climbing
or exercise structures or trails;
            2.   The ability of the public to access and use the land for
recreation purposes in perpetuity;
            3.   The presence of group gathering spaces, such as open lawns,
seating, picnic areas, plazas, or pavilions;
            4.   Landscaping that enhances the city and the park by providing
shade, educational opportunities, trees, and/or wildlife habitat; and
            5.   The ability of the city to provide programming in the space.
         (d)   If park development fees are credited, recreational amenities
and other improvements must be constructed onsite and approved by the city
during site plan or subdivision review at a specific time concurrent or prior
to residential uses, as stipulated in the associated development agreement.
Amenities must be shown on the site plan and/or construction plan as determined
by the city.
         (e)   A developer must post cash escrow or an irrevocable line of
credit in a form approved by the city for amenities included on private
parkland during site plan or subdivision review.
         (f)   If credited acreage does not satisfy the entire parkland
requirement, the city will calculate the remaining fee using the same
requirements in Appendix I to Ordinance 180327B, proportionally assessed.
      (7)   Submitting fee. Any fees required to be paid pursuant to this
subchapter shall be remitted:
         (a)   Prior to the issuance of any building permits for multi-family
use or development; or
         (b)   Prior to filing an associated plat for record for single-family
residential use or development.
      (8)   Use of fees.
         (a)   Fees may be used only for the purchase, acquisition,
development, and/or improvement of park facilities in the city. Potential
parkland in under-served areas within one mile of developments that have paid
parkland dedication fees, which have not yet been refunded, shall be a top
consideration (but not the only consideration) when evaluating potential land
for purchase or acquisition for future parks.
         (b)   Unimproved parkland or parks in need of additional improvements
within one mile of developments that have paid park development fees that have
not yet been refunded, will be a top consideration (but not the only
consideration) when evaluating parks for potential development and/or
improvements. Parks may be purchased, acquired, developed, or improved with
parkland fees in any portion of the city due to its small size since any
existing or future resident in the city is and will be within a convenient
distance to any existing or future park in the city.
      (9)   Reimbursement for city-acquired parkland. The city may from time to
time acquire and/or develop land for parks in or near an area of actual or
potential development. If the city does acquire and/or develop parkland in a
particular area near a development or subdivision that should come forward for
consideration, the city may require subsequent dedications to be in fee-in-
lieu-of land and parkland development fees instead of dedication and
development. This will be to reimburse the city for the cost(s) of acquisition
and/or development.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.59 PRIOR DEDICATION OR ABSENCE OF PRIOR DEDICATION.
   (A)   Depending on the circumstances, additional proportionate dedication
may be required for the increase in dwelling units from what was originally
proposed and may be either land dedication or money in lieu of land or
development, at the discretion of the Council. At the discretion of the
Council, any former gift of land or cash to the city may be credited toward
eventual land dedication or development requirements imposed on the developer.
   (B)   The Council shall consider recommendations of the Park Board in
exercising its discretion under this section.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.60 PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS.
   The city's approved plans, including the Comprehensive Plan and the Parks,
Recreation, and Trails Master Plan, are intended to provide the Park Board with
a guide upon which to base its recommendations and for the city to take action.
Because of the need to consider specific characteristics in the site selection
process, the park locations and sizes indicated in the plans are general. The
actual locations, sizes, and number of parks will be determined when
development occurs or when sites are acquired by the city, including by
donations.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.61 SPECIAL FUND; RIGHT TO REFUND.
   (A)   All parkland dedication fees will be deposited in a fund specifically
dedicated to the purchase and/or acquisition of parks in the city. All park
development fees will be deposited in a fund specifically dedicated to the
improvement and/or development of parks in the city.
   (B)   The city shall account for all fees in lieu of land dedication and all
park development fees paid under this subchapter with reference to the
individual plat(s) involved. Any fees paid for such purposes must be encumbered
or expended by the city within ten years from the date received by the city for
purchase, acquisition, development, and/or improvement of a park as required
herein. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first-in, first-out
basis.
   (C)   The developer of the property on the last day of the ten-year period
shall be entitled to a pro rata refund that includes the original contribution,
computed on a per dwelling unit basis, if the fees are not encumbered by
contract or purchase order, expended, or if the property under which fees were
paid has not received benefit from a park acquired or developed within the city
with the fees paid. The property owner of the property must request the refund
in writing, within one year of entitlement, or the right shall be deemed
permanently waived. Any interest earned with these funds shall remain in these
funds and be used for the fund's intent.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.62 PARKLAND GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS.
   Parks should be easy to access and open to public view so as to benefit area
development, enhance the visual character of the city, protect public safety,
and minimize conflict with adjacent land uses. The following guidelines and
requirements shall be used in designing and accepting parks and adjacent
development.
   (A)   Any land dedicated to the city under this subchapter must be suitable
for park and recreation uses. The dedication shall be free and clear of any and
all liens and encumbrances that interfere with its use for park purposes. The
City Manager or his designee shall determine whether any encumbrances interfere
with park use. Minerals may be reserved from the conveyance provided that there
is a complete waiver of the surface use by all mineral owners and lessees. A
current title report must be provided with the land dedication. The developer
shall pay all taxes or assessments owed on the property up to the date of
acceptance of the dedication by the city. A tax certificate from the Rockwall
County Tax Assessor or Kaufman County Tax Assessor, whichever is applicable,
shall be submitted with the dedication or plat.
   (B)   Land in floodplains or designated greenways is not preferred but can
be considered on a 50% per acre basis, at the discretion of the Council (for
example, four acres of floodplain or greenway will be equal to two acres of
potential parkland). The following factors shall be considered for potential
parkland in the floodplain or in designated greenways:
      (1)   Sites should not be severely sloping or have unusual topography
that would render the land unusable for recreational activities or for
improvements. At least 50% of a parkland site shall be less than 10% grade,
well drained, and suitable for active play, unless the intent of the dedication
is to provide a beneficial connection or to preserve an environmental, natural,
or cultural resource/asset;
      (2)   Placement of recreational or parkland support amenities, including
paths or access for maintenance purposes, can be placed in the area in
compliance with applicable watershed requirements;
      (3)   It is preferred that the floodplain area provide suitable passive
recreation, scenic views, wildlife habitat protection, water quality
protection, tree protection, and/or trail connectivity to the more intensive
uses in non-floodplain areas;
      (4)   Park sites shall have access to water and sewer lines prior to or
upon dedication. Site plans and subdivision applications must demonstrate
sufficient water and wastewater capacity to serve the park;
      (5)   Park sites should be located adjacent to greenways and/or schools,
where available, in order to encourage shared facilities and joint development
of new sites;
      (6)   Park sites should be adjacent to residential areas in a manner that
serves the greatest number of users and should be located to minimize users
having to cross arterial roadways to access them;
      (7)   Where appropriate, sites with existing trees or other scenic
elements or natural assets are preferred;
      (8)   Detention/retention areas shall not be utilized to meet dedication
requirements unless they are designed in an innovative manner so as to provide
for suitable recreational purposes, but they may be accepted in addition to the
required dedication. If accepted as part of the park, the detention/retention
area design must meet the standards as specified in all codes and regulations.
      (9)   Where park sites are adjacent to greenways, schools, or existing or
proposed subdivisions, access ways may be required to facilitate public access
to provide public access to parks;
      (10)   It is preferred that a minimum 50% of the perimeter of a park
should abut a public street. Parks shall have at least a portion of the
property adjacent to a public street or shall have associated public access
easements and improvements to allow for ready access. Public view of the park
from a public street is desirable to facilitate community connections and
provide for crime prevention through environmental design;
      (11)   Community-scale parks should be accessible from major arterial
streets so as to be accessible by large numbers of people;
      (12)   Areas for potential parkland that are encumbered by overhead
utility lines or easements of any type which would limit the opportunity for
recreational and park development are not preferred;
      (13)   All rubbish, trash, junk, and other offensive materials shall be
removed from all dedicated lands and the property returned to its natural
condition except as to approved construction and improvement thereon; and
      (14)   For dedications of more than two acres of land and upon the
request of the City Engineer, a developer-funded environmental or engineering
study, audit, or assessment may be required in some cases demonstrating that
the property is in a condition that would allow the city to utilize the
property for public park purposes without expenditures to remove or mitigate
environmental or hazardous materials or conditions; suitable and safe for use
as a public park; and free from environmental or engineering-related problems.
(Ord. 180327B, passed 3-27-2018)
§ 158.63 WARRANTY REQUIRED.
   (A)   All materials and equipment provided to the city shall be new unless
otherwise approved in advance by the City Manager or his designee, and all work
will be of good quality, free from faults and defects, and in conformance with
the designs, plans, specifications, drawings, and recognized industry
standards. This warranty, any other warranties express or implied, and any
other consumer rights, shall inure to the benefit of the city only and are not
made for the benefit of any party other than the city.
   (B)   All work by the developer not conforming to these requirements,
including, but not limited to, unapproved substitutions, may be considered
defective.
   (C)   This warranty is in addition to any rights or warranties expressed or
implied by law.
   (D)   Where more than a two-year warranty is specified in the applicable
plans, specifications, or submittals for individual products, work, or
materials, the longer warranty shall govern.
   (E)   This warranty obligation may be covered by any maintenance bond
tendered in compliance with this subchapter.
   (F)   If any of the work performed by the developer is found or determined
to be either defective, including obvious defects, or otherwise not in
accordance with this subchapter, the designs, plans, drawings, or
specifications, within two years after the date of the issuance of a
certificate of final completion of the work, or a designated portion thereof,
whichever is longer, within two years after acceptance by the city of
designated equipment, or within such longer period of time as may be prescribed
by law or by the terms of any applicable special warranty required by this
subchapter, developer shall promptly correct the defective work at no cost to
the city.
   (G)   The failure, including cracking or other indication of failure, of an
improvement shall be deemed conclusive that the workmanship or product is
defective.
   (H)   During the applicable warranty period and after receipt of written
notice from the city to begin corrective work, developer shall promptly begin
the corrective work. The obligation to correct any defective work shall be
enforceable under this code. The guarantee to correct the defective work shall
not constitute the exclusive remedy of the city, nor shall other remedies be
limited to the terms of either the warranty or the guarantee.
   (I)   If within 20 calendar days after the city has notified developer of a
defect, failure, or abnormality in the work, developer has not started to make,
and continuously worked to complete, the necessary corrections or adjustments,
the city is hereby authorized to make the corrections or adjustments, or to
order the work to be done by a third party. The cost of the work shall be paid
by developer.
   (J)   The cost of all materials, parts, labor, transportation, supervision,
special instruments, and supplies required for the replacement or repair of
parts and for correction of defects, shall be paid by developer, its
contractors, subcontractors, or by the surety.
   (K)   The guarantee shall be extended to cover all repairs and replacements
furnished, and the term of the guarantee for each repair or replacement shall
be two years after the installation or completion. The two-year warranty shall
cover all work, equipment, and materials that are part of the improvements made
under this subchapter.

(2005 Code, § 12-1-1) (Ord. 181211B, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 159.02 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The city is hereby divided into the above zones, or districts, as shown on
the official zoning map, which, together with all explanatory matters thereon,
is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
(2005 Code, § 12-1-2)
§ 159.03 LAND AND STRUCTURES TO BE USED AS REQUIRED BY DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
    (A)   The regulations set by this chapter within each district shall be
minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land, except as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied,
and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, except in
conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in
which it is located.
   (C)   No part of a yard or other space, or off-street parking or loading
space required about or in connection with any building or use for the purpose
of complying with this chapter, shall be included as part of a yard, open
space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other
building or use.
   (D)   Every building hereafter erected or altered shall be located on a lot
as herein defined.
   (E)   An accessory building/structure must be incidental to the main
building and must comply with all use regulations applicable to the main
building except as stated herein.
      (1)   An accessory building/structure may not be used for commercial
purposes except as permitted per the use district and within the definition of
home occupation.
      (2)   An accessory building/structure may not be rented separately from
the residence.
      (3)   A detached accessory building/structure may not be used for living
quarters which is comprised of rooms and/or areas that are normally associated
with residential accommodations, for example, kitchens, kitchenettes, dining
rooms, sleeping rooms, living areas, bathrooms and the like, except for guest
houses and servants quarters where permitted or granted by conditional use
permit.
      (4)   Accessory building/structures shall not be located in any front
yard.
      (5)   No accessory building/structure shall be constructed upon a lot
until the construction on the principal building has commenced with the
permanent foundation and framing in place.
      (6)   No accessory building/structure shall be put in use unless the
principal building is completed and occupied.
      (7)   With respect to accessory buildings/structures as defined in §
159.42, the Building Official or a representative designated by him or her must
also determine, based upon the following criteria, if the structure is an
attached accessory building/structure to the main building:
         (a)   That the required roof extension is a structural member of the
roof of the main building;
         (b)   That the roof extension does not exceed 24 feet in length,
excluding overhangs, and the ridgeline of the roof extension is not higher than
the roof over the main building;
         (c)   That the attached accessory use building/structure is no larger
than 900 square feet and is built of like material and design in generally the
same proportions (exclusive of glass) as the main building; and
         (d)   Does not contain attributes such as plumbing for a kitchen or
bathroom, which may cause the Building Official or his or her designated
representative to determine that such accessory building/structure should not
be allowed without the applicant obtaining a conditional use permit.
      (8)   If the Building Official or his or her designated representative
determines that an accessory building/structure is not an attached, integral
part of the main building under the foregoing criteria, and that otherwise the
accessory building/structure is not allowed under the provisions herein
relating to stand alone, detached accessory buildings/structures without a
conditional use permit, then the Building Official or his or her designated
representative shall advise the applicant that he or she must obtain a
conditional use permit for applicant's proposed accessory building/structure.
Each accessory building/structure used for non-residential or multi-family
residential purpose shall be considered a principal building/structure. The
regulations detailed in this section shall govern the location of swimming
pools and spas accessory to non-residential and multi-family residential uses.
      (9)   Distance between single-family and non-residential/multi-family
residential swimming pools and spas. When property occupied by non-residential
and/or multi-family residential uses abuts a single-family district, swimming
pool and spa accessories to the non-residential and multi-family residential
uses shall be located no closer than 50 feet to the single-family district, as
measured from the outside of the pool liner.
   (F)   When calculating lot area in all use districts or districts, such area
shall not include:
      (1)   Land that is in the regulatory floodplain;
      (2)   Rivers, lakes, and streams; and/or
      (3)   Rights-of-way.

181211B, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 159.04 NEWLY ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   (A)   All territory hereinafter annexed to the City of Heath shall assume an
interim classification of (A) Agricultural District, pending determination of
the property’s initial permanent zoning in accordance with the provisions of
state law and this chapter unless application for permanent zoning is submitted
by the property owner at the time of annexation. The City Planning and Zoning
Commission shall, as soon as practical after annexation of any territory to the
city, institute proceedings on its own motion, to give the newly annexed
territory a permanent zoning, following the same procedures as is provided by
law for the adoption of original zoning procedures. The interim zoning prior to
the permanent zoning shall not be considered a rezoning for legal purposes. The
procedure for establishing initial zoning other than on annexed territory shall
conform to the procedure established by law for the adoption of normal zoning
classifications and regulations.
   (B)   In an area classified (A), no person shall erect, excavate, construct
or proceed or continue with the erection or construction of any building or
structure or add to, enlarge, move, improve, alter, repair, convert or extend
of demolish any building or structure or cause the same to be done in any newly
annexed territory to the city without first applying for and obtaining a
building permit therefor from the building official as may be required in
applicable city ordinances.
(2005 Code, § 12-1-4)
§ 159.05 PURPOSE OF THE USE DISTRICTS.
    The purpose of the use districts described herein is to group together into
districts those uses that are reasonably compatible with one another according
to their normal characteristics of operation:
   (A)   To permit, in connection with these uses, those customary and
necessary accessory activities which are incidental to the principal use;
   (B)   To permit certain other uses which may be established in some
situations and subject to specific conditions so that the special uses will
also be compatible with the uses allowed as a matter of right;
   (C)   To promote orderly, timely, economic growth and to recognize current
land-use conditions;
   (D)   To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for development
to meet the present and future growth needs of the city, with allowance for
adversity of sites;
   (E)   To protect use areas, as far as possible, against heavy and
unnecessary through traffic;
   (F)   To protect use areas against pollution, environmental hazards, and
other objectionable influences;
   (G)   To protect use areas against congestion, as far as possible, by
managing the density of population in and around them; by providing for proper
off-street parking spaces; and by providing open areas for rest and recreation
and to break the monotony of continuous building bulk, thus providing a more
desirable environment;
   (H)   To provide for privacy and access of light and air to windows and to
all devices that are powered or healed by the sun, as far as possible, through
controls over the spacing and height of buildings and other structures;
   (I)   To promote the most appropriate use of land and direction of building
development which is not in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan or the adopted
policies of the city; to promote stability of development; to protect the
character of the districts; to conserve the value of land and buildings; and to
protect the city's tax base;
   (J)   To promote the most efficient use of city facilities and services;
   (K)   To protect against fire and explosions and other safety hazards, and
to provide for fire protection and access by fire equipment and vehicles;
   (L)   To accommodate use activities and operations whose external physical
effects are restricted to the area of the district, and in no manner affect in
a detrimental way any of the surroundings districts; and
   (M)   To preserve and protect the favorable and unique quality of life
enjoyed by the citizens of the city.
(2005 Code, § 12-1-5) (Ord. 181211B, passed 12-11-2018)
§ 159.06 PRESERVATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
    (A)   In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan, land that is classified
within any floodplain, including the 100-year floodplain with fully developed
conditions for the entire watershed, shall not be reclaimed nor included as lot
area.
   (B)   The protected floodplain or 100-year floodplain with fully developed
conditions for the entire watershed is defined as the area that is certified by
a professional engineer to be within the 100-year floodplain, assuming build-
out or fully developed conditions for the entire area within the relevant
watershed.
   (C)   No excavation, filling, grading, or any other type of altering the
protected floodplain elevation shall occur until, and unless, the excavation,
filling, grading, or alteration has been approved by the Council, who may
ascertain, based upon a recommendation from the City's Engineer, that such
alteration is not subject to flood damage and would not constitute an
encroachment, hazard, or obstacle to the movement of flood waters and that the
value and safety of other property, or the public health and welfare would not
be endangered.
(2005 Code, § 12-1-6) (Ord. 040617B, passed 7-1-2004; Ord. 181211B, passed 12-

approved by the Architectural Review Board, Planning and Zoning Commission, and
City Council as required by §
160.01.
   (C)   Special exceptions for new construction.
      (1)   Exceptions to the residential masonry requirements, including an
exception for buildings for farm animals, may be permitted on a case-by-case
basis by the City Council upon a review and recommendation of approval from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, submission and approval of elevation drawings
of the subject structure, and material samples and after a public hearing is
held. Before the tenth day prior to the public hearing, the city shall send
notice via regular mail to all property owners, as indicated by the most recent
tax appraisal roll, within 200 feet of the property on which the exception is
requested.
      (2)   Barns used for agricultural or farm animal purposes on sites of ten
acres or more are excluded from this masonry requirement.
      (3)   The City Council may consider any of the following criteria for
establishing reasonable grounds for a special exception:

construction standards;
         (b)   Encouragement of high-quality development resulting in
longevity, durability, and sustainability that ultimately strengthens the local
tax base;
         (c)   Encouragement of visually appealing construction consistent with
a community of excellence and livability as specified in the Comprehensive
Plan; and
         (d)   Any other factors that the City Council deems pertinent and
appropriate to determine the merits of an application for special exception
under this section.

existing as of March 15, 2011 is exempt from this section subject to the
following provisions.
      (1)   The exterior walls of such non-conforming buildings may not be
modified, altered, or enlarged in a way, which increases its nonconformity
unless the modification, alteration, or enlargement is in conformity with the
provisions of this section.
      (2)   Should a non-conforming building be moved for any reason or for any
distance it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment may authorize a special exception from
divisions (D)(1) and (2) above so long as the exception is consistent with the
provisions of §
159.49, Nonconforming Uses.

designee, shall be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this
section.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment, pursuant to Tex. Local Gov't. Code, §
211.009, upon application duly filed by the applicant and deemed
administratively complete by staff, may grant a special exception from the
requirement of division (E)(1) provided that a property owner demonstrates a
hardship in complying with the above requirement.
   (F)   Application fee required. At the time the special exception
application is filed, the applicant shall pay a fee as determined by the fee
schedule.

USE DISTRICTS
§ 159.20 (A) AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The Agricultural District is to be used to promote orderly, timely,
economic growth and to recognize current land use conditions. The district is a
reserved area in which the future growth of the city might occur. It is the
intent of this district that agricultural land be held in that use for as long
as is practical and reasonable. This zoning is suitable for areas where
development is premature because of a lack of utilities, capacity or service,
or where the ultimate land use has not been determined.
      (2)   The zone is also to be used:
         (a)   To protect those areas that are unsuitable for development
because of physical problems or potential health or safety hazards such as
flooding. The usage of the land would be permanently restricted to low-
intensity agricultural uses until such time as the property is proven to be
suitable for development and is rezoned; and
         (b)   To provide a permanent greenbelt to preserve natural areas or
open space buffer around uses that might otherwise be objectionable or pose
environmental or health hazards.
   (B)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   Farming, ranching, related activities, and one primary detached
single-family dwelling per lot, with a minimum lot area, as defined herein, of
ten acres.
      (2)   Home occupations;
      (3)   Municipality owned or controlled facilities, utilities, and uses;
      (4)   Temporary concrete batching plants limited to the period of
construction, upon approval of location and operation by the Building Official;
      (5)   Wind energy systems on lots greater than ten acres in size subject
to all terms and conditions of §
159.50; and
      (6)   A single open landscape structure on the same lot as an accessory
to a residential use and used as a trellis, arbor, pergola, gazebo, or outdoor
kitchen that does not exceed 350 square feet in area and 15 feet in height.
      (7)   Accessory buildings and dwelling units. The maximum combined floor
area, maximum size for a single building, maximum wall height, and number of
accessory buildings per lot/tract permitted shall be based on the lot/tract
size. Such regulations shall conform to the following criteria in the table

§ 159.28 (PD) PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The city has adopted a Comprehensive Plan which provides for: the
maintaining of the current overall density in the city of one dwelling unit per
developable acre of lot area, as defined herein; rezoning of the current
agricultural and one-acre zoned areas allowing smaller lot sizes only on an
exception basis; and generally maintaining the open, rural atmosphere of the
city.
      (2)   This district is being adopted primarily to facilitate the goals of
the Comprehensive Plan by providing the city a zoning district which allows the
confirmation of developments proposed by applicants that have varying lot sizes
within a given tract(s) of land and which fall between existing zoning
categories. This district does not allow a greater number of residential lots
than would otherwise be achieved by SF-43 zoning, but instead allows limited
flexibility in lot sizes to accommodate particular topography and other natural
conditions. The district does not permit mixing of residential and retail or
commercial uses, as mixed use residential is not a land use established by the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   A planned development (PD) is generally on tracts of land of ten
acres or more (but may be considered on smaller tracts) and may include a
combination of different dwelling types and/or a variety of land uses which
creatively complement each other and harmonize with existing and proposed land
uses in the vicinity.
      (4)   The minimum required amount of acreage in a proposed project for
which application for a Planned Development District is made shall be given
consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission with recommendations
forwarded to the City Council. Other purposes of the district are to maintain
conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, encourage creative development of the
land, preserve the natural amenities of land, provide locations for well-
planned comprehensive developments, and allow for variety and flexibility in
the development patterns of the city.
      (5)   Although this district permits the flexibility of having different
densities in different portions of the district, this district does not allow
clusters of dense residential development but instead to facilitate maintenance
of current overall density of one dwelling unit per developable acre as
described in the Comprehensive Plan.
      (6)   The Council is empowered to grant permits for planned developments
only after review and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission
under the procedures established herein.
   (B)   Uses permitted. A Planned Development District may only be approved
for a use or combination of uses provided for in this chapter including special
use permits. The uses permitted in any specific Planned Development District
shall be enumerated in the ordinance establishing the districts.
   (C)   Density and open space regulations.
      (1)   In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan, land that is classified
within any floodplain, also referenced as the 100-year floodplain with fully
developed conditions for the entire watershed, shall not be reclaimed nor
included as lot area.
      (2)   To comply with the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, higher
percentages of open space should be required as the density is increased or the
lot sizes decreased.
      (3)   The designation of open space as improved, partially improved, or
unimproved shall be subject to the approval of the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The designations shall be determined in consultation with the
developer, preferably with on-site inspections and the Planning and Zoning
Commission may divide a given area into two or more designations. In making
this determination the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be guided by the
following factors:
         (a)   The size and location of these areas in relation to the overall
area of the Planned Development District;
         (b)   The degree to which these areas contribute to the quality,
livability, and amenity of the Planned Development District; and
         (c)   The degree to which the developer agrees to improve the land for
active or passive recreational purposes.
   (D)   Area and other requirements.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, area requirements for
each use shall be within the maximum and minimum standards applicable to such
use as if the use was situated in the zoning district to which it is most
similar as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or demonstrate
that the intent of the standards has been met in accordance with good planning
practices. The zoning district most similar to each use shall be stated in the
granting ordinance. Also, in the Planned Development District, each use shall
conform to the regulations of the zoning district to which it is most similar
as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and the Planned
Development District shall conform to all other sections of the Zoning
Ordinance, unless specifically excluded in the granting ordinance. All
applications to the city shall list all requested differences, if any, from the
standard requirements set forth throughout the Zoning Ordinance (applications
without this list will be considered incomplete).
         (a)   Average lot size shall remain one acre lot area, as defined
herein.
         (b)   Minimum lot size shall be one-half acre of lot area, as defined
herein.
         (c)   Lots less than three quarters of one acre of lot area, as
defined herein, shall constitute no more than 5% of total number of lots in any
planned development and lots between three quarters of one acre and one acre of
lot area, as defined herein, should constitute no more than 15% of the total
number of lots in any planned development.
         (d)   Lot area, as defined herein, may not be counted towards both
residential and commercial or retail purposes. Portions of a development that
will be used for commercial or retail purposes may not be included or credited
towards residential density calculations.
      (2)   Modification of the area requirements contained in this section may
be allowed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council when all of
the following circumstances are met:
         (a)   The proposed modifications substantially meet the intent of the
Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances;
         (b)   The proposed modifications help preserve the natural amenities
of the land and/or are justified by unusual or unique characteristics of the
subject property; and
         (c)   The proposed modifications shall not be granted to relieve a
self-created or personal hardship, nor for financial reason only.
   (E)   Application process. An application for a Planned Development District
shall be made to the Planning and Zoning Commission in the same manner that an
application for a zoning change is made. An application shall include and be
accompanied by a concept plan as required by this section, which when finalized
shall become a part of the amending ordinance. A complete development plan as
set out in division (E)(2)(e) below, may be substituted for a concept plan, and
will constitute both the concept plan and the development plan. In addition to
the requirements outlined in divisions (E)(1)(b) and (2)(f) below, the Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council may require additional information or
special plans related to specific elements of the Planned Development and may
require information described in division (E)(2)(f) below with the concept
plan. Upon receipt of the application and concept plan, the City Secretary or
designated representative shall follow notification requirements for a public
hearing as specified in this chapter.
      (1)   Concept plan.

all applicable regulations and requirements. The application shall contain a
disclosure and representation indicating whether or not any contiguous or other
neighboring properties are owned, under contract or otherwise controlled by the
applicant or related parties in the form and substance from time to time
prescribed by the City Attorney. Although an applicant may not include such a
neighboring property in its application, the city should be aware that it on
its own motion may initiate a zoning case on any property within the city.
         (b)   The concept plan shall be prepared on a topography base map at a
scale of one inch=100 feet, or at a scale to be specified by the city staff,
along with an eight and one-half-inch by 11-inch reduction, with no less than
five-foot contour intervals, unless the City Manager or Planning and Zoning
Commission agrees to greater intervals, and shall include all items in §
158.05 above, concept plan of the Subdivision Ordinance and the following

per gross acre in the area or areas proposed to be devoted to residential use;
            3.   A description of the proposed lot or lots and the boundaries
thereof, proposed setbacks on the lots and proposed minimum dwelling unit
sizes;
            4.   With the exception of single family dwellings, the location of
each existing and each proposed structure in the development, the use or uses
to be contained therein, the number of stories, the gross floor area and the
location of entrances and loading points thereof. If a particular type
structure is to be built a number of times, a typical lot layout may be
substituted;
            5.   All public rights-of-way, curb cuts, driving lanes, parking
areas, loading areas, public transportation areas and illumination facilities
for the same, including existing facilities to be relocated. Design criteria
for illumination facilities may be required;
            6.   All pedestrian walks, malls and open areas for use by tenants
or visitors;
            7.   All reservations for public uses, including parks,
playgrounds, schools and other open spaces;
            8.   The location, size, height and orientation of each sign,
except signs that are flat on building facades and that do not directly face
property in a residential district, or directional signs;
            9.   Facilities for waste disposal for other than single-family
uses;
            10.   Proposed street names for all public roads;
            11.   Elevations and/or perspective drawings may be required in
order that the relationship of the buildings to adjacent property, open spaces
and to other features of the development plan may be determined. This division
does not apply to single family, duplex and townhouse lots, unless required by
the Planning and Zoning Commission;
            12.   Any and all of the required features may be incorporated on a
single drawing if such drawing is clear and suitable for evaluation by city
officials;
            13.   A legal instrument establishing a plan for permanent care and
maintenance of any common areas or communally owned facility and any privately
owned open spaces (including permanent access rights to such private space)
must be submitted before the development plan will be approved. All such
instruments shall be approved by the City Attorney as to legal form, and by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council as to suitability for the
proposed use of the common area;
            14.   The title page of each application and set of plans shall be
signed by the applicant’s architect, planner, landscape architect, engineer
and/or land surveyor if these services are required. In addition to an engineer
and a planner (if any), the applicant’s submittal may be required to contain
the professional services of at least two of the remaining three professionals
involved in the design and construction of the environment;
            15.   A list of any changes from the concept plan which are
contained in the development plan;
            16.   Phases of development, including delineation of areas,
building sites (where applicable), land use and improvements to be constructed
in independent phases and the scheduled timing and sequencing of development;
            17.   If standards or deviations approved with the concept plan are
different from the base zoning district, such as lot sizes, building setbacks
and similar requirements which are not uniformly applied to the development
depicted in the plan, such standards and deviations shall be illustrated on the
development plan; and
            18.   The full text of any homeowners or owners association
requirements and covenants to be imposed on the property.
         (g)   Phase developments.
            1.   The concept plan shall be divided into sections of proposed
development so that after a final development plan is approved for any section,
there will be definitely established lines showing the resulting boundaries of
the remaining PD District. Such division should be made in order that the
unused portion of the site area could be rezoned to its previous or another
classification and so that no more than a minimum amount of damage would result
to the unused portion of the site from an usability standpoint if it were
rezoned.
            2.   In reviewing and approving applications for a phased PD the
city should seek to ensure that each phase (or each phase considered
collectively with phases to be completed prior to such phase) conforms with the
density and other requirements of the Comprehensive Plan, in order to avoid
circumstances in which a phase is permitted to be completed which is not in
conformity and in which subsequent phases are delayed for inordinate periods of
time or are not completed.
            3.   Development plans for each phase may be submitted separately
as the phases are ready for development.
         (h)   Effects of recording. All final development plans approved
hereunder shall be binding upon the applicant, their successors and assignees,
shall limit and control the issuance and validity of all permits, and shall
restrict and limit the construction, locations, use and operation of all land
and structures included within such plans to all conditions and limitations set
forth in such plans.
         (i)   Issuance of permit.
            1.   Upon, but not before, the approval, of the development plan as
herein set forth, and completion of platting requirements as set forth in the
Subdivision Ordinance, the applicant(s) for said plan shall be entitled to
apply for the permits and certificates as are necessary to proceed with the
accomplishment of such plan.
            2.   Upon the approval of the concept plan and rezoning of a land
parcel to PD, Planned Development District, and upon the approval of the
development plan, the applicant shall proceed with the accomplishment of said
development plan in accordance with all other ordinances of the City of Heath.
         (j)   Compliance with development plan. The Building Official shall
ensure compliance with this chapter, the concept plan and the development plan.
He or she shall:
            1.   Make inspections to determine compliance with the provisions
of this chapter and the concept plan and development plan, and initiate
appropriate action in accordance with the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance;
            2.   Investigate thoroughly any complaints of noncompliance
concerning the development plan and keep a record of all complaints, indicating
any action taken; and
            3.   Upon determination of noncompliance with the development plan,
the Building Official shall take action as follows:
               a.   Give written notice to the property owner of the nature of
the violation, the necessary action to remedy the violation, and the time
period, not less than ten days nor more than 30 days after the date of
notification, within which to comply.
               b.   Notify the Planning and Zoning Commission of the
noncompliance if the violations have not been corrected within the prescribed
time period.
         (k)   Effect of development plan approval.
            1.   If development of a lot or tract with an approved development
plan has not been completed within three years of its final approval by
completing all of the streets and other improvements contemplated by such
development plan and the related plat, the development plan and related plat
shall be deemed to have expired and a new review and approval of a development
plan and plat for development of the property shall be undertaken by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council upon application by the owner,
and such new approval shall be required before a building permit may be issued
for development. The review and approval shall be evaluated according to the
standards of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan, taking into account all
changes to the ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan which have occurred
subsequent to the prior development plan approval.
            2.   If the development plan is submitted in conjunction with an
approved phasing plan for development of the lot or tract, the development plan
shall be deemed to have expired if any phase is not completed within the time
period approved for such phase. No development plan phase may be planned to
exceed three years unless specifically authorized by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council when demonstrated that due to the size or
complexity of the development the three-year time period would create a
hardship. If any phase is not completed within the time period approved, the
entire remaining uncompleted development plan and plat shall be deemed to have
expired and the provisions of this division shall be followed.
            3.   Extension of an approved development plan may be granted by
the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council upon submission of a
request for such extension by the property owner at least 90 days prior to the
expiration of the plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council
shall take into consideration any changes that have occurred in this chapter
and the Comprehensive Plan subsequent to original approval of the plan and the
property owner may be required to bring the plan into compliance with the
current requirements. The period of time approved for any such extension shall
be indicated in any approval but in no case shall the period of extension
exceed three years.
   (F)   Development schedule.
      (1)   In addition to or in lieu of the requirements of division (E)(2)(k)
above, an application for a Planned Development District shall, if the
applicant desires or the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council
requires, be accompanied by a development schedule indicating the approximate
date on which construction is expected to begin and the rate of anticipated
development to completion. The development schedule, if adopted and approved by
the City Council, shall become part of the development plan and shall be
adhered to by the owner, developer and their successors in interest. The City
Council, in the ordinance approving the development schedule, may authorize the
Planning and Zoning Commission to extend the development schedule or adopt a
new development schedule without additional public hearings.
      (2)   Annually, where a development schedule has been required the
Building Official shall report to the City Council the actual development
accomplished in the various Planned Development Districts as compared with the
development schedules.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may, if in its opinion the owner
or owners of the property are failing or have failed to meet the approved
scheduled, initiate proceedings to rezone the Planned Development District by
removing all or part of the Planned Development District from the zoning
district map and recommending that the area involved be placed in another
appropriate zoning district. This recommendation shall be passed to the City
Council as are other amendments to the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   The owner or owners may, at any time, apply to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for an extension of the development schedule. The application
shall be acted upon by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council,
or if the ordinance setting out the development schedules gives the authority
to the Planning and Zoning Commission to extend the development time, the
action of the Planning and Zoning Commission making extension shall be final.
In the event the Planning and Zoning Commission denies the extension, the owner
or owners of the property shall have a right of appeal to the City Council.
   (G)   Assuring completion of certain improvements.
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of division (C)(7) above, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may specify in approving a
Planned Development District more restrictive requirements and more accelerated
completion schedules than those in that division for the completion of
improvements to open space and may specify similar or more restrictive
requirements and completion schedules for landscaping, screening walls and
other improvements to be made in a Planned Development District.
      (2)   These requirements may include, but are not limited to, completion
of certain improvements prior to the issuing of building permits or
certificates of occupancy and the requirement of bonds or other financial
support to guarantee completion.
   (H)   Coordination with Subdivision Regulation Ordinance.
      (1)   Processing under the Subdivision Ordinance shall be carried out
simultaneously with the review of the development plan under this section.
      (2)   The development plan submitted under division (E) above shall be
accompanied by a preliminary plat which meets the requirements of the
Subdivision Ordinance. The preliminary plat shall be reviewed and approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the granting of any building
permits.
      (3)   Every Planned Development District approved under the provisions of
this section shall be considered as an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance as
applicable to the property involved. In carrying out the development of a
Planned Development District, the development conditions and the development
schedule, if required, shall be complied with and such conditions as are
specified for the development of a Planned Development District shall be
construed as conditions precedent to the granting of a certificate of
occupancy.
   (I)   Continuation of existing planned developments. All Planned Development
Districts approved in accordance with the provisions of this section or by
subsequent amendments thereto shall be referenced on the zoning district map,
and a list of the Planned Development Districts together with the category of
uses permitted therein shall be maintained in the Appendix of this chapter.

   (E)   The framework: blocks, lots and streets. All future development within
the District shall fit within the general concept of blocks, lots and streets.
This system comprises the most fundamental "building blocks" of a traditional
town center, as follows:
      (1)   Blocks. Blocks shall be comprised of one or more lots. Blocks
bounded by peripheral streets and shall follow these standards:
         (a)   Shape. Blocks are typically rectangular or square in shape in
order to yield efficiently shaped lots. However, other shapes, such as
triangles, are occasionally acceptable; specifically allowing for shapes that
best fit the land contour with some shapes that are more organic and less
orthogonal.
         (b)   Size. In order to maximize vehicular and pedestrian access, and
to reinforce a human scale, no block may exceed 600 ft. in length along any
axis.
      (2)   Lots. Lots are land areas for development that are bounded by at
least one street and, generally, bound by a rear alley and/or adjacent lots.
Lots shall follow these standards:
         (a)   Shape. Lots are usually rectangular in shape, although
variations are acceptable; flexibility in shapes that best serve the District
will be considered.
         (b)   Size. No lot may be less than 20 ft. wide or 80 ft. deep. There
are no maximum lot size standards. Variances may be considered by the City
Council for sensibly proportioned lots to follow the topography where such
variances are deemed to not deviate from the underlying goals and objectives
established for the District.
      (3)   Streets. Street design requirements for the District shall be
determined by the street classification. "Primary" streets include FM 740
(Laurence Drive), Hubbard Drive, FM 1140 (Smirl Road), FM 740 (Bois D'Arc), FM
549 (Buffalo Way Road), and FM 550. State roads are controlled by the Texas
Department of Transportation standards, and parking is not permitted on FM
roads. Any existing or future street not designated as a primary street shall
be a secondary street. Alleys located central to the block are optional. If
provided, alleys must consist of a 20 ft. paved width.
         (a)   Primary street.
            1.   Right-of-way (R.O.W.) - 70 ft. width;
            2.   Curb-to-curb - 38 ft.; driving lanes - 11 ft. width;
            3.   Parallel degree parking lanes - nine ft. width;
            4.   Sidewalks - eight ft. width; and
            5.   Planting strip with street trees - eight ft. width.
         (b)   Secondary street.
            1.   Right-of-way (R.O.W.) - 60 ft. width;
            2.   Curb-to-curb - 36 ft. width;
            3.   Driving lanes - ten ft. width;
            4.   Parallel parking lanes - eight ft. width;
            5.   Sidewalks - six ft. width; and
            6.   Planting strip with street trees - six ft. width.
   (F)   Buildings: location and scale.
      (1)   Front setbacks from primary streets and secondary streets. Facades
shall be five ft. to 15 ft. from the lot's frontage line (front lot line/street
R.O.W.). Corner buildings are considered as having two frontages.
         (a)   Front setback exceptions. Setback intrusions, such as stoops,
balconies, porches, canopies, awnings, and bay windows, may encroach within
front setbacks, but not within the public right-of-way, along secondary streets
only between grade and a ten ft. clearance height. Right-of-way intrusions
meeting the height clearance requirements shall not extend within two ft. of
the street curb.
         (b)   Courtyards. Central courtyard recesses are permitted.
         (c)   Outdoor dining. Front setbacks up to 25 ft. are permitted to
accommodate outdoor dining if a design treatment is applied along the lot's
frontage line (edge of sidewalk furthest from street). Examples of acceptable
design treatments include a wall, fence and/or hedges no greater than three and
one-half ft. in height.
         (d)   Building setbacks along certain primary street thoroughfares.
Along FM 740 (Laurence Drive), Hubbard Drive, FM 740 (Bois D'Arc), FM 549, and
FM 1040 (Smirl Drive) shall be 35 ft.
            1.   No paved parking areas shall be allowed within this 35 ft.
setback area.
            2.   Said setback area shall be landscaped in conformance with the
35% landscaped area requirement for each lot.
            3.   A ten ft. wide concrete trail, designed with a meandering or
serpentine configuration, shall be required on one side of the street as
approved by the City Council.
      (2)   Side setbacks from primary streets and secondary streets.
         (a)   Buildings shall be five ft. to 15 ft. off the side property
line. The only exception is for access drives and/or parking to the side of a
building to consist of no more than 70 ft. in width between adjacent buildings.
         (b)   Variance request for a zero ft. internal side yard setback to
construct a series of connected storefront façades across more than one lot
along the block face of a primary or secondary street shall require approval by
the City Council after receiving a recommendation from the Architectural Review
Board and the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (3)   Rear setbacks from primary streets and secondary streets. All
buildings shall be set back at least three ft. from the rear property line.
      (4)   Building heights. No building height may exceed one story in
height.
         (a)   One-story buildings shall be a minimum of 18 ft. in height, with
a maximum height not to exceed 25 ft.
         (b)   Building heights shall be measured from the average grade level
at the front façade to the average height of the highest roof structure for a
pitched roof or to the top of the parapet for a flat roof.
            1.   For buildings with flat roofs, the minimum height of a roof
parapet wall shall be three feet and six inches in height, as measured from the
highest elevation of the finished roof deck.
            2.   No rooftop equipment shall be visible from an adjoining
sidewalk that serves a building with a flat roof.
         (c)   Exceptions.
            1.   An exception is allowed for vertical architectural elements,
such as towers, belvederes, and similar elements. Such elements may be up to 35
ft. in height if they have a footprint no greater than 240 sq. ft. This
exception may extend to a maximum of 45 ft. in height for institutional and
religious buildings.
            2.   Two-story buildings shall only be permitted with the approval
of a conditional use permit (C.U.P.) by the City Council after receiving a
recommendation from the Architectural Review Board and the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
   (G)   Cultural/institutional buildings.
      (1)   Cultural and institutional uses, such as churches, schools,
governmental buildings, libraries, museums, and parks, may deviate from
District standards in order to make them more prominent and as a means of
emphasizing their significance to the community. The following standards shall
apply:
         (a)   Building locations. Cultural and institutional buildings shall
be allowed to have more generous front and side setbacks than those of
commercial buildings in order to emphasize their significance. There shall be
no setback standards.
         (b)   Locations at special sites such as corners or sites terminating
a street axis shall be sought for cultural and institutional buildings.
      (2)   Architectural character. Cultural and institutional buildings shall
have a civic character, which might include classical architectural design
elements (symmetry, pediments, columns, and the like). Main entrances shall be
clearly articulated. Roof forms shall also include cupolas, steeples, and
similar vertical architectural elements intended to give the building
prominence. Such vertical elements may extend up to ten ft. above the maximum
building heights otherwise permitted.
      (3)   Parking. Off-street parking for cultural and institutional
buildings shall not be permitted between the building and its primary street
frontage. Parking shall be located and designed to be minimal in appearance
when viewed from the public right-of-way.
   (H)   Buildings: design and materials.
      (1)   Concepts. Architectural character should evoke the image of a
classic Texas town. Designs that refer to "period architecture" should be
interpreted in a contemporary way. Building groupings should be composed of a
series of individual elements that stand on their own but when combined,
contribute to a coherent overall sense of place. The buildings and storefronts
are to build on the basic design themes of the downtown while striving for
design creativity and individual expressions.
      (2)   Building walls. Shall be finished in brick, stone, wood clapboard,
or wood board and batten. Smooth, three-coat stucco shall only consume no more
than 20% of any façade, excluding door and window openings. Cementitious
materials accurately duplicating wood are also permitted. Non-masonry materials
shall be painted or unpainted.
      (3)   Chimneys. Shall be 100% brick or stone masonry.
      (4)   Windows and door glass. Window and door glass shall be code
compliant and not reflective or noticeably tinted.
      (5)   Canopies and awnings. Canopies shall be constructed of wood, metal,
or metal and glass in a design compatible with the building architecture.
Awnings shall be made of natural or synthetic canvas or opaque reinforced vinyl
on a galvanized steel pipe or tubular aluminum frame. Translucent vinyl and
rigid plastic are not permitted.
      (6)   Security features. External security features, such as door or
window grilles, are prohibited.
      (7)   Street level uses. Design and leasing of ground floor areas should
focus on uses that enhance and enliven the pedestrian experience along the
street. Retail uses should occur as continuously as possible along the ground
plane of a primary street.
      (8)   Entrances.
         (a)   Each building shall have at least one primary entrance having
direct access to the applicable street. In the case of corner buildings, the
primary entrance shall be on the primary street. For any large structure, a
front entrance will be provided for every 100 feet frontage.
         (b)   Secondary entries oriented toward parking lots other than
service entries are discouraged. For uses at the ground floor, other than
basement mechanical storage and parking levels, the finished floor elevation
may not be lower than the finished sidewalk grade.
      (9)   Opening locations. Openings (doors and windows) in upper floors
shall be vertically aligned with ground floor openings. Upper floor gable end
openings must be centered within the gable. All openings shall be a minimum of
two ft. from building corners.
      (10)   Shutters. When used, shutters shall be sized and shaped to match
the window opening.
      (11)   Character and massing.
         (a)   Simple yet varied massing promotes a character. Breaking down
the massing and scale of larger buildings creates a pedestrian-scaled
collection of smaller individualized elements that is in keeping with the
overall concept. Especially at corners, create a varied skyline with forms
(i.e., towers, domes, and rotundas).
         (b)   Accentuate important locations, especially entries. Architecture
of "mass" that provides deep openings and shadow lines, as well as details
enhanced by the sun, are encouraged. Architecture should enhance the pedestrian
experience by providing human-scaled details and amenities.
      (12)   Exterior appearance of buildings.
         (a)   Expression of the base, middle, cap. Architectural massing that
strongly defines a base, middle, and cap is required.
            1.   BASE. The ground level where the building makes contact with
the earth.
            2.   MIDDLE. The upper middle portion of the building, forming the
majority of the structure.
            3.   CAP. The parapet, entablature, or roofline where the building
meets the sky.
         (b)   Roof forms should be expressed whenever possible along the
pedestrian realm in a visually interesting fashion, avoiding flat,
unarticulated expressions.
         (c)   The base and tops of buildings will vary in material, and
façades must include articulated ground floor levels, minimum three-foot
overhangs at eaves, articulated cornice lien, and a stone base.
      (13)   Façade design.
         (a)   Storefronts. Where ground floor uses are commercial, the ground
floor façade shall have continuous storefront windows along the street
frontage. Commercial ground floors shall have a minimum of 60% glazed surface
(measured between grade and the interior ceiling level). Corner buildings shall
only have to comply on one of two frontages.
         (b)   Large spaces. - On "primary commercial" street frontages, a
front entrance shall be provided for every two ft. of façade frontage for each
building. An alternative to an individual user having multiple front entrances
is the use of separate liner space on the frontage for separate users. Such
liner space must have a front entrance.
      (14)   Vertical bays. Façades shall be broken into vertical bays not
exceeding 30 ft. in width through the use of one or more of the following
approaches:
         (a)   Façade recesses;
         (b)   Façade projections and/or pilasters; and
         (c)   Canopies and roofline or parapet changes can supplement those
approaches to further define the vertical bays.
      (15)   Corner treatment.
         (a)   Buildings will reinforce a strong corner condition at street
intersections. Angled corner clips (or other building conditions that do not
form a protruding corner) are not allowable at street intersections but may
occur up to twice within the block (between street intersections). Buildings
will be designed to accommodate City of Heath required visibility triangles
without compromising the corner design.
         (b)   The dominant primary cladding material will transition a minimum
of 20 fenestration feet around building corners.
      (16)   Punched-type windows are appropriate. They should be inset from
the face of the building to create deep shadow lines and visual relief.
         (a)   To control glare and reinforce the traditional image of bearing
wall architecture, ribbon windows and curtain walls are discouraged.
         (b)   Clear glass is required in all retail storefronts; smoked,
reflective, or black glass is prohibited.

         (a)   Color palette should take cues from the classic base colors of
Texas materials including but not limited to warm earth tones such as tan,
ochre, beige, and terra cotta. Roses, pinks, plums, and violets should
generally be avoided.
         (b)   Vibrant accents may be used in limited quantities at appropriate
locations. Accents are to be of high-quality materials and are used to promote
a vibrant street life in a manner compatible with the "civic" nature of the
street.
   (I)   Site design.
      (1)   Access to parking. No driveways are permitted on the District's
primary commercial street segments. Only access from other streets or alleys is
allowed here. Where driveways are permitted, driveways must be at least 200 ft.
from other driveways on the same block face, and at least 150 ft. from any
intersection.
      (2)   Driveway widths. Where driveways are permitted, driveways shall not
exceed a width of 24 ft.
      (3)   Parking. Within the District, the city's minimum requirements as
applied elsewhere in the city may be exceeded by no more than 10%.
      (4)   Parking locations. In the District, parking may not be located
between a building and its associated street. It may be located beside
buildings but may not exceed 70 ft. in width.
      (5)   Impervious surface. The maximum amount of impervious coverage shall
not exceed 65% of the net developable lot area.
      (6)   Surface parking. All surface parking lots shall be paved per city
standards. Parking lots will not front main arteries in retail/office areas.
Parking will be integrated into the District behind buildings where possible
through the use of similar landscaping and building materials.
         (a)   Consistent repetitive placement of streetscape elements, i.e.
trees, will be placed every ten parking spaces on surface parking lots.
Situations where parking spaces directly abut structures are discouraged unless
no alternative exists.
         (b)   Off-street parking aisles will be oriented perpendicular to
buildings so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars and/or provide
separate distinct pedestrian walkways.
         (c)   The alignment of travel lanes within parking lots in long
straight configurations that facilitate speeding is discouraged. Use of traffic
calming elements is encouraged.
         (d)   Shared parking is allowable as approved by the city to reduce
the total number of parking spaces within the District and to capitalize on
off-peak parking synergies.
      (7)   On-street parking. The street curbs will neck down at intersections
where on-street parking occurs.
      (8)   Parking screening. The portion of all parking lots fronting a
street shall be screened with a masonry wall, ornamental metal compatible with
the adjacent architecture, and/or evergreen hedges.
      (9)   Fences and railings. Fencing within the commercial streetscape can

         (a)   Railings may be necessary as a safety feature or as a functional
support rail (leaning rail) for people to lean against.
         (b)   Railings and fences can help define the street space. Fences and
railings should have an ornamental character as well as utilitarian function.
         (c)   Where railings or fences in a particular district contribute to
the overall image of the area, try to use the same or similar design details to
reinforce that character.
         (d)   Permitted fence and railing types shall be masonry, ornamental
metal and/or evergreen hedges.
         (e)   Ornamental metal fences and railings shall be black and use
historic precedents for design. Wooden fencing is not permitted.
         (f)   Fences and railings must not interfere with pedestrian safety by
blocking access from the street to the sidewalk.
         (g)   In certain situations, a railing is required to protect the
public against potentially hazardous grade changes.
         (h)   Pedestrian safety railings at grade changes shall be a minimum
of 42 inches high. They must have intermediate rails, balusters, ornamental or
patterned infill.
         (i)   Fences and railings should be between 32 inches and 48 inches in
height.
         (j)   Where desired, there may be place leaning rails at bus stops,
places where shoppers are picked up or dropped off, and places where people are
likely to stop or wait without necessarily wanting to sit.
         (k)   Leaning walls should be between 27 inches and 42 inches in
height.
         (l)   A two-inch to three-inch-high curb, placed four inches in front
of a railing, will prevent the footrest of wheelchairs or other wheeled
vehicles from striking the railing's vertical supports.
         (m)   Railings must be designed to support loads in both the
horizontal and vertical directions in accordance with applicable codes.
      (10)   Walls and screens. Walls shall be constructed of either brick or
stone, although other masonry materials, such as concrete, may be used if
covered in masonry or stucco.

stone or concrete and shall be between 32 and 42 inches in height along front
lot lines.
         (b)   Walls and screens may be included in a streetscape to direct or
screen view or to provide changes of grade.
         (c)   The height and material selected should relate to building
architecture and the character of the District.
         (d)   Walls and screens can be important in creating a continuous
sidewalk edge that unifies the street space.
      (11)   Hedges. Hedges shall be evergreen and planted to create a solid
year-round visual screen. At maturity, the hedge shall be maintained at a
height between 32 and 42 inches along front lot lines.
      (12)   Building voids. Where voids exist between buildings along the
designated primary streets within the District, fences, walls and/or hedges
shall be provided along the lot's frontage in accordance with the design
requirements described herein for parking lot screening. This requirement is
limited to developed sites only.
      (13)   Rear walls and fences.
         (a)   Walls and fences that do not extend beyond the front façade of
the associated building may be as high as six ft., but only if used for side
and rear yards.
         (b)   Chain link fences are not permitted anywhere within the
District.
      (14)   Flagpoles. If attached to a building, flagpoles must be no more
than six ft. long and wall-mounted at a 45-degree angle. If freestanding,
flagpoles shall not exceed 20 ft. in height. No single property may have more
than two flagpoles.
      (15)   Lighting. Lighting may not produce glare on adjacent properties.
Freestanding lighting fixtures, such as those located in parking lots, shall
not exceed 16 feet in height. Additionally, all outdoor lighting shall conform
with the requirements of
Chapter 98. Where
Chapter 98 and §
159.29 conflict, the regulations of §
159.29 shall prevail.
      (16)   Loading and dumpsters. Loading areas and dumpsters shall not be
visible from any adjacent streets.
         (a)   Loading areas shall be screened from streets by either their
location or screening treatments.
         (b)   Dumpsters shall be located to the rear of their associated
buildings and shall be enclosed on all sides by a brick or stone masonry
enclosure extending up to the full height of the dumpster.
         (c)   Screening gates are required to be primed and painted solid
metal and should screen the dumpster from view when closed. Gates should swing
out to an angle greater than 900 and create an opening at least 12-feet wide
for the truck to enter the enclosure. Pins should hold the gates open while the
dumpster is being accessed. Gates should also swing clear of all fire lanes.
   (J)   Signs.
      (1)   (a)   The purpose of the signage criteria is to ensure that
tenants, residents, and visitors can easily make their way through the District
and related development. Signage should be designed appropriately to contribute
to the overall identity and way-finding system.
         (b)   The process for sign approvals within the District, including
variances, shall be consistent with the citywide process for signs. Temporary
curb signs are subject to city approval.
      (2)   Sign area. An area on the façade of a building below the roofline
which is free of windows, doors or major architectural details and not higher
than the lowest of the following:
         (a)   Twenty-five feet above the adjoining sidewalks;
         (b)   The bottom windowsills of the second story;
         (c)   The highest part of the building between the head of the top
story window and the underside of the roof; and
         (d)   Signage and environmental graphics should be conceived as an
integral part of the building's architectural design. The number of signs
should be limited to avoid clutter.
      (3)   Wall signs. Signs mounted directly on a building wall. May not
project from the wall more than eight inches and shall cover no more than 40%
of the sign able area. Signs shall not obscure architectural features or
detail.

         (d)   The light levels of a sign should not block views of other signs
on the street or the façade of nearby buildings.
         (e)   All sign lighting shall conform to the requirements as specified
in
Chapter 98.
   (K)   Streetscape standards.
      (1)   The term "streetscape" applies to that area between the buildings
on either side of an urban street. The District streetscape is urban in
character with a density of pedestrian traffic. Therefore, plantings of shade
trees, ornamental trees, scrubs, evergreen groundcovers, vines, and seasonal
color set in paved surfaces are appropriate for front yard development.
Plantings will promote entrance demarcation and pedestrian interest.
Flexibility from the developer will be allowed as long as the intent of these
guidelines is respected.
      (2)   Streetscape components include driving lanes, parking lanes,
sidewalks, landscaping, lighting, streetscape furniture (benches, trash
receptacles, and the like), building faç
      (3)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks give pedestrians access along streets.
Sidewalks in the District should be detached from the curb. This provides room
for street trees close to the curbs.
         (a)   Concrete is the preferred material, although interlocking
concrete unit paving, flagstone, and brick paving may be acceptable upon review
by Building Official and City Engineer. Special paving in tree lawns with
special soil that promotes healthy trees is recommended where pedestrian use is
heavy and tree lawns cannot support turf or ground covers.
         (b)   Paving is the best way to unify the street. Over-designed
patterns may become chaotic or dated. Pattern and color should be subdued and
avoid sharp contracts with surrounding paving. Paving patterns should provide
enough contrast to delineate crosswalk/pedestrian traffic areas in order for
drivers to notice. Patterns should relate to the size and shape of the space
and should create a sense of order in the placement of other street furnishings
and plant materials.
         (c)   There should be established and maintained clear unobstructed
pedestrian paths.
         (d)   A path of ten feet width is desired, but as little as five feet
may be allowed in constrained locations.
         (e)   Detached sidewalks should include tree grates, surrounded by a
hard surface of pavers or concrete.
         (f)   Curb ramps are required anywhere the sidewalk crosses a curb.
Troughtype ramps are recommended.
      (4)   Crosswalk pavements.
         (a)   Crosswalks are generally painted at signalized intersections in
most areas of the city. In commercial areas, the crosswalk materials and
pattern can be an important unifying feature of the District. Within the
District, it is important to treat each street intersection the same in terms
of size of curb radius, location, and type of curb ramps, signage location and
paving within crosswalks. Crosswalk pavement shall contrast with the adjacent
street pavement through color or texture.
         (b)   Even if the crosswalk is distinguished in terms of color and
texture, it is still necessary to install "stop bars" using painted or
thermoplastic street marking material.
      (5)   Sidewalk paving. Concrete including plain grey, integral colored
concrete, and special finishes are acceptable (excluding stamped concrete,
seeded concrete or epoxy concrete).
         (a)   Concrete should be a minimum of four inches thick, meeting
industry standards for concrete mix, finishing, curing and sealing.
         (b)   Care should be taken when using integral pigmented colored
concrete. Select subdued and earth tone colors that will complement natural
materials. Rich or bright colors will draw more attention than desired.
         (c)   Use only paving bricks specifically designed for sidewalk use
according to industry standards. Brick pavers must be set on a concrete slab
with mortar joints and not on a sand base. Interlocking concrete pavers are a
durable choice. Set on a sand base with tight sand joints according to
manufacturers' recommendations. Flagstone pavers are recommended in historic
areas where they originally existed.
         (d)   Installation may be on a sand base with sand joints or on a
concrete base with mortar joints. Precast concrete pavers may be installed
using finish and color guidelines as discussed under concrete pavement above.
These pavers must be installed a concrete slab with mortar joints. Once
installed, all pedestrian walks must be safe for pedestrians with no gaps or
joints larger than one-fourth inch.
      (6)   Paving not allowed. Seeded concrete and epoxy concrete are not
acceptable because of appearance, poor durability, and future maintenance
problems.
         (a)   Any glazed product or smooth, slippery surface product should
not be used in pedestrian traffic areas for pedestrian safety.
         (b)   Any thin-set material should not be used because of future
maintenance problems.
         (c)   Any clay brick product other than paving brick should not be
used because it may be difficult to maintain and the product's resistance to
freeze-thaw damage may not be adequate.
         (d)   Any material that is so textured or patterned that it may cause
a tripping hazard should not be used.
      (7)   Street furnishings. Street furnishings such as seating, bicycle
racks, bollards, and trash receptacles are important functional elements and
amenities, especially in the commercial streetscape. They should be attractive
and unified within any given district. Maintenance, safety, and comfort are
primary considerations in the design and placement of street furnishings. All
furnishings placed in the right-of-way should be of high quality, designed for
outdoor use and require minimum maintenance. In general, street furnishings
should be located at least two and one-half feet from the curb face where on-
street parking occurs, and three and one-half feet where travel lanes adjoin
the curb.
      (8)   Seating. Seating may be provided when space allows for a clear
pedestrian walking zone and separate seating areas. Seating expands
opportunities for people to use the street, especially in commercial
streetscapes. Seating may be provided by benches, planter walls, edges, steps,
or moveable chairs.
         (a)   Seating surfaces should be 16 to 18 inches high and should have
a minimum depth of 16 inches for seats without backs, 14 inches for seats with
backs.
         (b)   Walls, ledges, and steps that are available for seating should
be between 12 to 20 inches high and 16 inches wide wherever possible.
         (c)   Walls used for seating on both sides should be a minimum of 30
inches wide. Seating should be durable and comfortable. Avoid sharp edges and
poorly designed or fabricated furniture.
         (d)   Metal is the preferred material. Seating design should
complement the style of the surrounding architecture and other furnishings.
         (e)   Except for moveable chairs, seating should be secured
permanently to paved surfaces for safety and to avoid vandalism.
         (f)   Seating should not interfere with plant materials or pedestrian
circulation and should be placed for psychological comfort.
         (g)   Comfortable seating should provide a sense of having protection
from behind and something interesting to look at such as storefronts or other
pedestrians.
         (h)   Seating adjacent to where bicycling is permitted on sidewalks or
other bike paths must have a minimum three-foot clearance from the bicycle
path. These areas should not be provided on the street where possible.
      (9)   Bicycle racks. Bicycle racks should be provided within commercial
streetscapes to encourage bicycle use.
         (a)   Avoid placing bicycle racks in areas where they may endanger the
safety of pedestrians or cyclists.
         (b)   Select racks that are permanently mounted structures, designed
in a simple style, and easy to use.
         (c)   The rack must allow both the frame and at least one wheel to be
locked. Racks that allow for the locking of only one wheel are not acceptable.
         (d)   Place bicycle racks where they are near entrances of gathering
places. Avoid placement that creates a tripping hazard.
         (e)   If possible, place the racks where the parked bicycles will be
visible from inside the adjacent building. Ideally, bicycle parking should be
more convenient than automobile parking.
      (10)   Bollards. Bollards are generally used to create a low barrier that
separates auto and pedestrian traffic, highlight and protect a special feature,
emphasize the historical character of the area or direct circulation patterns.
         (a)   Select a bollard design that is architecturally and
aesthetically appropriate to the area and other streetscape elements. Bollards
can be used to provide low-level lighting to pedestrian paths.
         (b)   Bollards should be between 28 and 42 inches high. Bollards
should be set two and one-half feet minimum clearance from curb face.
         (c)   Clearance between bollards or between bollard and any other
structure or pole must be at least 36 inches.
         (d)   Clearance must be at least 60 inches where there is clearly one
primary path.
         (e)   Bollards may be chained or cabled together if provided with
attachments as an integral part of the design.
         (f)   Standard pipe filled with concrete is not acceptable in
pedestrian locations.
         (g)   Utilize removable bollards where service vehicles need periodic
access.
      (11)   Clocks. Clocks are intended to display time for pedestrian and
vehicular use, in addition to serving as a punctuation point for the area.
Clocks should relate architecturally to surrounding buildings and furnishings.
      (12)   Kiosks. Kiosks are intended to serve as informational points, to
direct pedestrian traffic and to organize outdoor spaces. They should be used
sparingly and only when needed to impart community information.
         (a)   Kiosks should be carefully positioned in conjunction with other
elements of street furniture such as benches, lighting, and landscaping. They
should be focal points in open areas and may be combined with other elements
like business directories, telephones, mailboxes and newspaper racks. The
design should be compatible with and complementary to the surrounding
architecture and other furnishings.
         (b)   Kiosks should facilitate the posting of notices and their
removal and cleaning.
         (c)   Kiosks should be easily accessible from all sides and adequately
illuminated.
         (d)   Kiosks should be designed so they are easy to maintain.
      (13)   Trash receptacles. Trash receptacles should be easily accessible
for pedestrians and trash collection. Their design should relate to other site
furnishings as well as building architecture. They must be carefully placed to
be unobtrusive yet effective.
         (a)   On concrete trails where bicycling is permitted, maintain a
three-foot setback from the edge of trail.
         (b)   Trash receptacles should be designed to fit the anticipated use
and frequency of maintenance. They should be firmly attached to paving to avoid
vandalism.
         (c)   Covered tops and sealed bottoms should be included to keep the
contents dry and out of sight at all times.
         (d)   Trash receptacles should be designed in two pieces. The inner
container should ensure easy trash pickup and removal and an outer shell should
blend aesthetically with the other streetscape elements.
         (e)   They should be conveniently placed near benches, bus stops, and
other activity nodes, and arranged with other streetscape elements into
functional compositions.
         (f)   They should not be placed directly adjacent to benches.
      (14)   Fountains. A fountain provides moving water that masks noise, as
well as cools and humidifies the air, increasing comfort and beauty in a space.
Fountains can also be used to define space or provide an interesting focal
point.
         (a)   The rim around the fountain or pool should be between 12 and 20
inches in height and 16 inches in width if used for seating.
         (b)   Fountain design should respond to wind direction, building
location, pedestrian circulation, potential ice build-up in winter and the
appearance of the fountain and its basin when not operating.
         (c)   Fountains should include a recirculating pump for conservation
purposes.
         (d)   Maintenance is crucial to the success of all fountains. The
owner should be committed to maintenance prior to beginning design.
      (15)   Newspaper racks. Outdoor newspaper racks are prohibited.
      (16)   Mailboxes. Mailboxes are placed by the U.S. Postal Service. Their
location should be coordinated with the Postal Service during design to
minimize clutter.
      (17)   Public art. Public art should capture and reinforce the unique
character of a place. It can interpret the community by revealing its culture,
history, or fantasy.
         (a)   Art that invites participation and interaction and that adds
local meaning is preferred. Art should add beauty and interest. It may feature
humor, water, seating, and opportunities for children to play.
         (b)   The setting for public art is significant to the experience of
the art itself. The place's impact on the art may be as great as the art's
impact on the place. The two together enrich the place and make it memorable.
         (c)   When considering placement of freestanding pieces of art or
sculpture, avoid locations where it would compete with a storefront or obstruct
a pedestrian path, create a traffic hazard, or compete with another sculpture.
         (d)   Bas-relief may be used to enliven otherwise blank walls.
         (e)   Construct public art using durable materials and finishes such
as stone or metal.
      (18)   Miscellaneous street uses. Uses such as street vendors, shoeshine
stands, food trucks, and the like are encouraged in order to activate and
enliven the street, but require a special permit.
      (19)   Utility boxes, meters, and manholes. Coordinate the location of
all proposed utility boxes and meters, including irrigation controls, with the
proposed locations of site furnishings, trees, signs and lighting.
         (a)   Boxes and meters should be located two and one-half feet from
the curb face and should not interfere with pedestrian movement.
         (b)   There are several kinds of utility cabinets that may need to be
accommodated, including cabinets for electric meters, water meters, water/
irrigation controllers, backflow preventers, traffic signal switching equipment
and transformers.
         (c)   Utilities should not be located under walkways, or where they
might interfere with or preclude street trees.
         (d)   Traffic signal switching gear cabinets are of a standard design.
They must be located near the signals they control, with care not to block
pedestrian access at the street corner.
         (e)   Electric meters, water meters and irrigation controllers can be
handled individually or consolidated into one cabinet.
         (f)   Transformer vaults and switch cabinets are larger and should be
located as inconspicuously as possible.
         (g)   Any cabinet must be accessible, with room to swing the doors
open and space to get the necessary equipment in position for service. Check
with the appropriate utility for specific access requirements.
         (h)   Before finalizing the design of any streetscape improvements,
existing overhead and underground utilities should be located and sized with
the assistance of the various city departments.
         (i)   These elements should be painted a neutral background color or
be integrated into the surrounding area so that they do not stand out.
   (L)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Minimum amount of landscaped areas as a percentage of the net
developable lot area shall be 35%, with 50% of the total requirement located in
the required front yard. All required landscaped areas shall be permanently
maintained and shall have an irrigation system installed meeting all applicable
city codes and be approved by the Building Official.
      (2)   Landscaping for the District be simple but substantial. Canopy
shade trees, rather than conifers or ornamentals, should line the outside
(street side) of sidewalks along all primary streets, with a maximum spacing of
40 ft. between trees. Either metal grates or planting beds are recommended for
trunk bases. It is recommended that shrubs be avoided, with the exception of
screening undesirable views, such as parking and loading areas.
      (3)   Tree grates. Tree grates are an attractive way to protect trees
planted in paved areas. Tree grates are the recommended method for tree
planting in paved areas.
         (a)   Open tree grates should be at least five feet by five feet with
openings no more than one-fourth inch in width.
         (b)   The size and shape of tree grates should relate to the paving
pattern. They should be designed to allow for tree trunk growth, constructed of
ductile iron, and unpainted or painted a dark color with a durable, factory
applied finish.
         (c)   Irrigation systems within grates are preferred but dry wells may
be allowed with written maintenance agreements from the owners. The irrigation
system should be on a zone separate from all other landscape zones.
         (d)   If string lights are anticipated in the trees, electrical
outlets should be provided in the tree grate area.
         (e)   If up lighting is desired, select a tree grate manufactured to
support the light (see lighting standards).
         (f)   Tree wells must drain into the storm sewer in order to avoid
damage because of existing non-porous clay soil.
      (4)   Street trees. Trees give many benefits to the city. They supply
shade, buffer wind, sun, and help clean the air and reduce glare. Street trees
are the most important tool for buffering people from cars. They create a
pedestrian space, make the street more comfortable and provide beauty year-
round. Without street trees, pedestrians are exposed to the sun and the car
with little sense of comfort. On commercial streets, trees are the most
significant element that makes streets attractive to shoppers. Without street
trees, shoppers feel the heat, glare, dust, and pollution of the roadway. With
them, the harshness of a paved environment is alleviated, and pedestrians can
enjoy shade, beauty, and amenity that is essential to a pleasant shopping
experience.
         (a)   A formal, repetitive use of trees is recommended to unify
districts and create a continuous pedestrian scale suited to storefronts.
         (b)   Design for street trees should respond to the uses on the
street. In most areas, the same species should be planted on a block.
         (c)   Different species with similar characteristics, such as form and
color may be alternated in a regular pattern to avoid over-use of one species.
         (d)   The loss of numerous trees in any city due to diseases such as
Dutch Elm reflects the danger of extensive planting of a single species.
      (5)   General tree guidelines. Many factors affect design in commercial
streets, including the volume of pedestrians, the size and orientation of
sidewalks, the distance from trees to buildings, the visibility of façade and
signs, and the speed and volume of vehicles.
         (a)   Trees should have the same characteristics on both sides of the
street. If mixing species, alternate them in a regular pattern. Plant only one
species where an area is to be unified. Avoid random changes in species.
         (b)   Select trees that will fit when they are mature. Narrow areas
suggest a narrow tree and open areas suggest a wide one.
         (c)   Where tree lawns do not exist, tree grates or pavers are
recommended to protect tree roots and pedestrians.
         (d)   Ground covers may be considered in low traffic volume areas. Use
tree grates where pedestrian traffic is high.
         (e)   Min. five inch caliper at installation to provide maturity and
canopy definition at outset.
         (f)   Trees encouraged where possible, in particular at intersections
as a transition to adjacent neighborhoods.
         (g)   Secondary streets shall be planted with trees 25 ft. on center.
         (h)   Trees shall be planted within all parking tree islands.
      (6)   Tree location. Consider mature tree size before planting so that
trees have room to grow. Where signs, lights, overhead or underground
utilities, utility poles, and fire hydrants would limit mature tree size,
adjustments in species or location should be considered to minimize excessive
pruning.
         (a)   Plant trees with regular spacing on side streets to create a
continuous street edge. Adjust spacing for driveways and lights.
         (b)   Trees should be located in the center of the tree lawn, two ft.
- six inches from b.o.c.
         (c)   Create a clear walking zone between trees and buildings. For the
District, ten feet is minimum. Distances as low as five feet may be possible
where space is very limited, however, few tree species will be appropriate in
such a small area.
         (d)   Trees must be placed far enough away from buildings to allow
them to grow without excessive pruning.
      (7)   Tree size. Trees should be large enough when planted to add
substantial shade and to reach a height appropriate to surrounding buildings.
         (a)   Street trees in grates should be three-inch caliper, minimum,
with high branching where pedestrians will be passing beneath the tree canopy,
and that adequate branching height is achievable without severe pruning.
         (b)   The branching height of mature trees should be no less than 13
feet six inches above the street. The branching height of mature trees should
be no less than eight feet above the sidewalk.
         (c)   Small varieties of thornless and fruitless trees may be used
only in median areas or traffic islands where lower branching habit will not
interfere with pedestrians, vehicles, or driver visibility.
         (d)   Trees within the special use and small street tree should only
be used where power lines overhead would not allow a large street tree to reach
maturity without severe pruning.
      (8)   Tree selection. All trees should fit the microclimate, soils, sun,
moisture, budget and maintenance environment in which they are planted. This is
a major concern in areas with high levels of pollution or automobile and
pedestrian damage. Trees should be able to endure pollution, compacted soils,
minimal water, and low maintenance.
         (a)   Trees near walks should be thornless and fruitless to minimize
maintenance and to reduce pedestrian hazards. They must be strongly wooded,
resistant to most diseases and insects, single-trunked, with upright growth and
a medium to long life expectancy. Branches should resist breaking.
         (b)   Bradford Pear trees and species of a similar weak wood are
prohibited. Trees and irrigation techniques that require minimal water should
be considered.
         (c)   Irrigation must be installed for street trees in all commercial
streets. Irrigation must be designed to deliver the appropriate amount of water
to each tree with minimum waste. Easily adjustable, automatic irrigation
controls are recommended along with bubblers.
         (d)   Along commercial streets, trees should be selected that will
minimize the obstruction of views to retail signs. Employ trees with
appropriate form and character. Utilize tree spacing that supports this
concept.
      (9)   Recommended street trees. Heath's climate and soils limit the
variety of species that are recommended for street tree planting. These species
best meet the selection and size guidelines for most conditions and are
preferred for their dependability, low maintenance, and drought resistance.
Watering habits and soil conditions significantly affect the root structure.
The following is the approved plant material list for plant materials required
in these guidelines. Other species may be utilized with approval from the city.
         (a)   Large trees (shade).
Common Name Botanical Name
Common Name       Botanical Name
Caddo Maple       Acer barbatum “Caddo”
Pecan             Carya illinoensis
Chinese Pistachio Pistacia chinensis
Bur Oak           Quercus marcrocarpa
Chinquapin Oak    Quercus muhlenbergii
Shumard Oak       Quercus shumardi
Texas Red Oak     Quercus shumardi "Texana"
Live Oak          Quercus virginiana
Cedar Elm         Ulmus crassifolia
Lacebark Elm      Ulmus parvifolia
 
         (b)   Special use and small street trees. These small trees should
generally not be planted as street trees; however, they may be used in medians
and for entry marker plantings. The small street tree should only be used where
overhead power lines along the street edge would not allow a large street tree
to reach maturity without severe pruning. The list below notes those trees that
are not appropriate for use along the street edge while the others may be used
both as a special use and small street trees.

      (10)   Groundcovers, shrubs, and flowers. Plantings provide seasonal
color, direct circulation, and serve as a buffer between people and cars.
Although they provide functional and aesthetic benefits, however, maintenance
is extremely important. Plant selections should be drought tolerant.
         (a)   Plantings other than trees in the streetscape may include turf,
ground covers or shrubs. This area helps soften the street environment along
the street edge.
         (b)   Tree lawns should be planted with sod or low groundcovers (below
six inches mature height) in commercial areas where pedestrian traffic does not
warrant paving.
         (c)   Very narrow tree lawns or those in high traffic areas may be
paved with brick, flagstone or concrete pavers and/or colored or scored
concrete. However, patterned (stamped) concrete is prohibited.
      (11)   Planting pots and planters. Planting pots provide an added
dimension and color to streetscape planting. Although planting pots are not
required, they are encouraged to help direct pedestrian traffic, create focal
points and provide pedestrian resting areas. Large pots are preferred instead
of fixed planter boxes because of potential conflicts with vehicles and
maintenance.
         (a)   Planting pots should be planted with annual flowers or with
ground covers.
         (b)   Pots should occupy a surface area of at least four square feet
and should not block other elements such as streets, signs, meters, or
streetlights.
         (c)   Planters that are to be used for seating should be between 12
and 20 inches in height with a rim of at least eight inches in width, wider if
seating is intended on the edge.
         (d)   Plant materials should not interfere with the seating.
         (e)   Provisions must be made for ensuring adequate watering and
drainage.
         (f)   Staining of paving from planter drains should be considered in
planter location.
   (M)   Lighting.
      (1)   Streetlights are important both for functional and decorative
purposes. In order to provide a human scale to the District, it is recommended
that lights range between ten ft. and 14 ft. in height.
      (2)   Spacing and location. Locate lights as part of an overall system
that organizes other street elements such as trees, benches, and paving.
         (a)   Place lights at least two and one-half feet from the back of the
curb to allow room for car bumpers and door swings. Align with street trees
where possible.
         (b)   Place lights at least five feet from the edge of the curb
transition point nearest the driveway, curb cut, or alley and at least 20 feet
from the extended flow line of the nearest intersection.
         (c)   Space lights at least 50 feet apart; 60 - 115 feet is preferable
in most cases to provide a pleasing effect and to ensure room for street trees
and other furnishings.
         (d)   Closer spacing can also cause uncomfortable glare. Install
luminaires a maximum of 14 feet and a minimum of 12 feet above sidewalks to
avoid glare into upper windows.
         (e)   Avoid placing lights adjoining residential zoning district
boundaries to avoid disturbing inhabitants.
         (f)   Lighting plans must have a photometric plan submitted to the
city for review at time of site plan submittal per § 98.05.
      (3)   Style and materials. Select lighting styles to integrate with the
architectural or historical character of the area.
         (a)   Acorn-type luminaires are recommended for most commercial
streets in order to maintain consistency throughout the city. Avoid selecting
different types of lighting for small projects.
         (b)   Poles should be well articulated with enough detail to create a
range of scale for the pedestrian whether near or far away. Flutes, moldings or
other traditional details are strongly preferred.
         (c)   Alternative fixtures that reflect local architectural or
historical character are subject to approval. Single luminaires are highly
preferred over multiples, which should be considered only for specific
locations such as gateways or entry points of a district.
         (d)   Luminaires are to be translucent or glare-free, utilizing
obscure glass or acrylic lenses. Any fixture having a total light emission
exceeding 1,500 lumens shall be a fully shielded light fixture per §
98.05.
      (4)   Pedestrian lighting. Pedestrian-scaled light posts and luminaires
play a vital role in developing the District's unique character. Pedestrian
lights illuminate the sidewalk and provide a feeling of security at night.
Fixtures should relate to the image and history of the area.
      (5)   Street lighting. Street lighting plays an important role in the
quality and safety of streets, especially at night. Lighting illumination
levels are based on two criteria: the uses along the street and the volume of
automobile traffic.
      (6)   Special effect lighting. Special effect lighting may include string
lighting in trees.
         (a)   If string lighting is desired, electrical outlets should be
included adjacent to each street tree. If uplighting is desired around trees,
tree grates should be used with cutouts for the light.
         (b)   Special effect lighting must have pinpoint lighting in order to
minimize nuisance.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 159.40 SITE PLAN APPROVALS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the site plan is to ensure compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance and to assist in the orderly and harmonious development of the
city, to protect and enhance the general welfare, and to help prevent the
impairment or depreciation of land values and development by the erection of
structures, additions, or alteration thereto without proper attention to site
planning. The purpose of the site plan review is:
      (1)   To ensure compliance with the Zoning Ordinance, while allowing for
design flexibility;
      (2)   To assist in the orderly and harmonious development of the city;
      (3)   To protect adjacent uses from obstructions to light, air, and
visibility;
      (4)   To provide protection from fire;
      (5)   To avoid undue concentrations of population and overcrowding of
land; and
      (6)   To facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water,
sewage, drainage, and other public requirements.
   (B)   When required. If, in the determination of the Planning and Zoning
Commission or City Council, a site plan is deemed necessary in order to elevate
a proposed use, or as required under any other provision of this section, such
site plan shall be submitted in the form and number as required by the Planning
and Zoning Commission. An outdoor lighting plan may also be deemed necessary in
order to elevate a proposed use. Such outdoor lighting plan shall comply with
the requirements as specified in
Chapter 98.
   (C)   Contents. The site plan shall contain drawings to scale to indicate as
needed:
      (1)   The location of all existing and planned structures on the subject
property and approximate locations of structures on adjoining property within
100 feet;
      (2)   Landscaping lighting, and/or fencing, and/or screening of yards and
setback areas;
      (3)   Design of ingress and egress;
      (4)   Off-street parking and loading facilities;
      (5)   Location of fire lanes;
      (6)   Location of solid waste collection facilities;
      (7)   Height of all structures;
      (8)   Proposed uses;
      (9)   The location and types of all signs, including lighting and
heights;
      (10)   Elevation drawings citing proposed exterior finish materials;
      (11)   Street names on proposed streets; and
      (12)   Additional information and detail as the Zoning Administrator
deems necessary.
   (D)   Approval. The City Council, after review and recommendation by the
Architectural Review Board and the Planning and Zoning Commission, may approve
a site plan if the proposed development meets all the minimum standards
established in this subchapter and other applicable ordinances, and if the
Council finds that the proposed development will not be detrimental to the
health, safety, or welfare of the surrounding neighborhood or its occupants, or
be substantially or permanently injurious to neighboring property. It shall
disapprove or conditionally approve any application that fails to meet the
above criteria or is in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan or the adopted
growth policies of the city.
   (E)   Submission to Architectural Review Board and Planning and Zoning
Commission for review. The site plan shall be submitted to the City Secretary
two weeks prior to the regularly scheduled Architectural Review Board, and then
the Planning and Zoning Commission for review. The Building Official or his
designee shall review these plans as quickly as possible, but in no case shall
he or she delay submission beyond one Architectural Review Board and Planning
and Zoning Commission meeting. The Architectural Review Board shall recommend
to the Planning and Zoning Commission that the site plan be approved,
disapproved, or approved with modifications, including the imposition of
conditions by making findings in accordance with the standards contained in
this chapter and such additional standards as may be adopted and published from
time to time. The Planning and Zoning Commission may remand the site plan back

§ 159.43 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS; PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   The purpose of the regulations described by this subchapter is to allow the
compatible and orderly development, within the city, of uses that may be
suitable only in certain locations in a zoning district, if developed in a
specific way or only for a limited period of time.
   (A)   Permit required. A use permit is required for all conditional uses as
set forth in the conditional use paragraph of each zoning district. At no time
may a structure or property be adapted to a conditional use without first
obtaining a conditional use permit. A permit may not be issued for any
conditional uses not specified in the zoning district without first amending
the Zoning Ordinance to permit the conditional use.
   (B)   Approval, procedure, responsibility and appeals. Conditional use
permits shall be considered for approval as an amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance and shall be approved as provided in division (D) below.
   (C)   Application, filing procedures and fees. Requirements for application
of conditional use permit:
      (1)   Applicant for conditional use permit must be the property owner, as
recorded with the Rockwall or Kaufman County Appraisal Districts, or the
property owner's designated representative;
      (2)   A conditional use permit may be used only by the applicant/property
owner. A change in property ownership prior to completion requires a new
application by the new property owner;

site plan application with such checklist items to take precedence when in
conflict with other requirements contained in this section; and
      (9)   Any other documentation required by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or City Council necessary for their decision regarding the issuance
of a conditional use permit.
   (D)   Requirements for approval. The City Council may permit a conditional
use after review and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission
subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards when the Council finds:
      (1)   That the proposed use meets all the minimum standards established
in this subchapter and other applicable ordinances;
      (2)   That the proposed use meets the intent of the district in which it
is located, and is in accordance with the comprehensive plan; and
      (3)   That the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health,
welfare and safety of the surrounding neighborhood or its occupants, nor by
substantially or permanently injurious to the neighboring property.

conditional use permit has not been used within six months after the date
granted, the City Council reserves the right to institute public hearings to
revoke and cancel such permit.
   (F)   Period of conditional use and renewal. The City Council may attach a
term limit to a conditional use permit. If an application for a building permit
is not made within one year from the date of the approved conditional use
permit, the conditional use permit shall be null and void. If the conditional
use permit does have a time limitation attached, the expiration date shall be
set forth. Any permittee wishing a renewal of such permit for successive time
periods shall make application for renewal to the City Secretary or his or her
designated representative, not less than 20 days before the permit expires. If,
after proper inspection, the city finds that the conditions of the original
permit are being met, and there have not been any complaints of noncompliance,
the permit may be renewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission for the same
time period as approved by the City Council originally. If there is evidence
of, or complaints of noncompliance, then renewal of the permit must follow the
same procedures and notification as the issuance of a new permit, and may be
renewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.

established in the District without a conditional use permit.
      (2)   Churches, schools, railroads, and other conditional uses
automatically allowed in each District by state law, but required within a
district to obtain a conditional use permit, must be issued a conditional use
permit subject to the use meeting reasonable requirements imposed under this
section.

§ 159.49 NONCONFORMING USES.
    The general public, the City Council, and the Planning and Zoning
Commission are directed to take note that nonconformities in the lot, use, and/
or development of land and buildings are to be avoided, or eliminated where now
existing, wherever and whenever possible, except: when necessary to preserve
property rights established prior to the date these regulations become
effective as to the property in question; and when necessary to promote the
general welfare and to protect the character of the surrounding property.
Except as hereinafter specified, any lot, use, building, structure, or yard
lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter or lawfully
existing at the time of annexation into the city may be continued with the
provisions of this chapter for the district in which it is located.
   (A)   Nonconforming uses continued or changed. The right to continue such
nonconforming uses shall be subject to regulations prohibiting the creation of
a nuisance and regulations reasonably protecting adjacent property.
   (B)   Conditional uses.
      (1)   Any use existing on the effective date of this chapter which is
listed as a conditional use in the district where it is located shall be and
shall remain a nonconforming use until a conditional use permit is obtained as
provided in this chapter.
      (2)   If the use is discontinued or abandoned for 180 days during any
three-year period, the use shall meet the requirements of this chapter and
shall obtain a use permit before it is continued.
   (C)   Alteration of nonconforming uses.
      (1)   No existing building or premises devoted to a use that is not
permitted by this chapter in the district in which such building or premises is
located shall be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity, except when required to do so by law or order, unless the use
thereof is changed to a use that is permitted in the district in which such
building or premises is located, and except as follows:
      (2)   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building may be changed to another nonconforming use of a more restrictive
classification when authorized by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with
the provisions of §§
159.46 or
159.47, or to a conforming use.
      (3)   Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use,
the use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
      (4)   When authorized by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of §§
159.46 or
159.47, enlargement or completion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use
may be made upon the lot occupied by the building, where the extension is
necessary and incidental to the existing use of the building and does not
exceed 25% of its area of nonconformity.
      (5)   When authorized by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of §§
159.46 or
159.47, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout those parts of a
building which were manifestly designed or arranged for the use prior to the
date on which the use of the building became nonconforming, if no structural
alterations, except those required by law, are made therein.
      (6)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to prevent the
extension of any building existing in any district at the time of the adoption
of this chapter, to the height to which the walls, foundation and frame work of
the existing building originally were intended, designed and constructed to
carry; provided, however, that the actual construction of the extensions in
height permitted by this division (C)(6) shall have been duly commenced within
two years from the date of the adoption of this chapter.
   (D)   Cessation of use of building or land. For the purposes of the
succeeding divisions, a use shall be deemed to have ceased when it has been
discontinued for six months during any three-year period whether with the
intent to abandon the use or not.
      (1)   No building or structure which was originally designed for or used
as a nonconforming use shall again be put to a nonconforming use, where the use
has ceased for six months or more during any three-year period.
      (2)   The use of land, structures and/or buildings involving individual
structures with a replacement cost of $1,000 or less, which does not conform to
the provisions of this chapter shall be discontinued within six months from the
enactment of this chapter. The nonconforming use of land and/or buildings
involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000 or less,
which becomes nonconforming by reason of subsequent amendments to this chapter
shall be discontinued within six months from the date of the amendment.
      (3)   All lots used for storage that do not require a building and the
use of the lot is made nonconforming by this chapter or amendments thereto
shall cease to be used for the storage within six months of the date of
adoption of this chapter or amendments.
   (E)   Construction approved prior to ordinance. Nothing herein shall be
construed to require any change in the overall plans, construction or
designated use of any development, structure or part thereof, where official
approval and the required building permits were granted before the enactment of
this chapter, or any amendment thereto where construction thereof, conforming
with the plans, shall have been started prior to the effective date of this
chapter or the amendment, and where the construction shall have been completed
in a normal manner within the subsequent 12-month period, with no interruption,
except for reasons beyond the builder’s control.
   (F)   Unsafe buildings, repair of. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to prohibit the strengthening or repair of any part of any building
or structure declared unsafe by proper authority, unless the repairs exceed 50%
of the replacement cost of the building.

replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the
structure as the case may be.
      (2)   If 50% or more of a nonconforming structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
or maintenance, and is declared by a duly authorized official to be unsafe or
unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored,
repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
   (I)   Moving of nonconforming structure or building. No conforming building
or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the

§ 159.50 WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate and to allow in
appropriate zoning districts the safe, effective, and efficient use of small
wind energy systems installed to reduce the on-site production and consumption
of utility supplied electricity while respecting the individual rights of all
property owners. It is in the public interest to regulate the use of small wind
energy systems in appropriate zoning districts consistent with the regulations
hereinafter adopted.
   (B)   Findings.
      (1)   The City of Heath recognizes that wind energy is an abundant,
renewable and environmentally friendly resource, and that its conversion to
electrical power reduces dependence on non-renewable energy sources and
decreases air and water pollution resulting from conventional energy sources.
While the city supports the use of non-polluting resources, the city
understands that wind energy production and effectiveness is limited in North
Texas due to inconsistent and insufficient winds which lack continuous presence
and velocity.
      (2)   Therefore, wind energy systems shall be permitted on tracts of ten
acres or more with a maximum tower height of 55 feet. Any proposed variance to
permitted systems, including proposal of a system on tracts less than ten
acres, must obtain a conditional use permit.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      dB/A. The sound pressure level in decibels.
      DECIBEL. The unit of measure used to express the magnitude of sound
pressure and sound intensity.
      SOUND PRESSURE. The average rate at which sound energy is transmitted
through a unit area in a specified direction.
      SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL. The sound pressure mapped to a logarithmic scale
and reported in decibels.
      SYSTEM. A wind energy conversion system that converts wind energy into
electricity that has a rated capacity of not more than ten kilowatts and is
intended for on-site production and consumption of electricity to serve the
needs of the consumer. SYSTEM includes a freestanding tower or a single device
attached to a building.
      TOWER HEIGHT. The overall height above grade of the tower including the
wind turbine, and all related accessories, but excluding blades.
      TURBINE. The parts of a wind energy system including the blades,
generator and tail.
      UTILITY GRID SYSTEM. A wind energy system designed and built to provide
electricity to the electric utility grid.
      YARD, FRONT.   An open, unoccupied space, on a lot facing a street
extending across the front of the lot between the side lot lines and from the
front of the main building to the front property or street line.
   (D)   General regulations. The following general regulations must be
demonstrated and apply to all wind energy systems within any district for which
a permit, including a conditional use permit, is under consideration and/or
granted.
      (1)   The proposed site of a wind energy system shall have sufficient
access to unimpeded airflow for adequate operation of the wind energy system in
accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
      (2)   Wind energy system generators which are electrically interconnected
to the local utility grid shall comply with all relevant Public Utility
Commission and local Transmission and Distribution Service Provider (TDSP)
rules and regulations governing the interconnected generation equipment. These
include completing an interconnection application and obtaining an approved
interconnection agreement as required by the TDSP.
      (3)   Wind energy systems must satisfy requirements of the most recently
adopted editions of the International Building Code, International Residential
Code, and the National Electric Code.
      (4)   A building permit must be obtained prior to the construction or
installation of a wind energy system and property must be platted in accordance
with city ordinances. The contracting installer must be registered with the
City of Heath and provide a certificate of liability insurance.
      (5)   The tower height (excluding blades) may not exceed 55 feet.
However, variances to height may be considered as part of a conditional use
permit due to the unique nature of property or other special circumstances.
      (6)   Tower blades must be located at a minimum of 20 feet above ground
level.
      (7)   Only freestanding towers are allowed to be placed on the ground. No
guy or other supports are allowed. Towers must not be climbable.
      (8)   No part of a system may be placed in the front yard.
      (9)   Any paint or finish other than what is recommended by the
manufacturer requires a conditional use permit.
      (10)   Setback requirement is a minimum of one and one-half times the
height of the tower as measured perpendicularly from any property line and all
existing and proposed structures including overhead utility lines.
      (11)   A system may be allowed on a lot only after a primary structure
has been constructed.
      (12)   One wind energy system is allowed per lot. (Wind farms are not
permitted in any district.)
      (13)   Sound pressure levels shall not exceed 50 decibels between the
hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. and 35 decibels between the hours of 10:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m., as measured from the property line closest to the system.
      (14)   All lighting not required by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) is prohibited. When required by the FAA, such lighting shall not exceed
the minimum FAA requirements and must be fully shielded as required in
Chapter 98 to avoid objections by surrounding property owners. Furthermore, the
wind energy system shall comply with all state and federal law, including those
of the State Public Utility Commission, Federal Aviation Administration and the
Federal Communication Commission or any other state or federal agency with the
authority to regulate wind energy systems.
      (15)   No advertising signs shall be allowed on any wind energy system.
      (16)   A new and separate conditional use permit is required for any
addition to an existing wind energy system. This includes but is not limited to
satellite receivers, radio or communications antennae.
      (17)   No part of the system shall be placed in any easement without the
written approval of the easement holder.
   (E)   Rooftop wind energy systems. Rooftop systems require a conditional use
permit. Rooftop systems may only be placed in the rear exterior of a building
away from public view as much as possible. The system must conform to all other
regulations including height restrictions. However, minimum acreage
requirements do not apply to rooftop systems.
   (F)   Application requirements. The following information and supporting
documentation must accompany every application for a wind energy building
permit and/or conditional use application for a wind energy system or variance
thereof:
      (1)   A plan view layout, submitted under the seal of a professional

and proposed structures on the site, existing easements, necessary consent to
any encroachments, natural features, an outdoor lighting plan as required in
Chapter 98, and fencing. A tree survey maybe required as deemed necessary
following a review by the Department of Public Works.
      (3)   Rooftop systems may not require submission of a full site plan.
Other general regulations, technical requirements, and application procedures
will apply as deemed appropriate by the Building Official.
      (4)   The appropriate building permit fee as determined by the city’s fee
schedule is due at the time of issuance of a building permit.
      (5)   A deposit in the amount of $1,000, in addition to the building
permit fee, is due at the time of application to cover the costs of
administrative review of the application by an outside source if necessary.
Administrative review includes but is not limited to engineering review, field
visits, and the confirmation that a checklist of items is complete prior to
being permitted or scheduled for consideration for a conditional use permit.
Review by the City Engineer or Building Official may result in additional fees
to be determined as needed including but not limited to frequent and final
inspections. The deposit or unused portion thereof will be refunded after a
final inspection or after termination of the application process.
      (6)   A conditional use permit application fee of $550 is required at the
time of submission of an application for conditional use in addition to the
required deposit.
   (G)   Maintenance.
      (1)   A system must be properly maintained at all times. Systems that
have become unstable or pose a danger of collapse must be removed or repaired
in accordance with notice from the Building Official. Such repair or removal
shall occur within 30 days from the date of the notice. If the removal or
repair is not completed within the specified time, the city may remove the
system and place a lien against the property for the costs of removal in
accordance with state law.
      (2)   If, for any reason, the system is abandoned or discontinued for a
continuous period of 90 days, written notice shall be given to the owner to
remove the system within 30 days of the date of the notice. Notice shall also

Adjustment sitting as the Appeals Board for matters pertaining to the abatement
of dangerous buildings pursuant to the adopted Code for the Abatement of
Dangerous Buildings.
   (H)   Further subdivision may necessitate removal of wind energy system. Any
permitted wind energy systems shall be removed by the lot owner of record
should any subdivision of land occur which reduces a lot size to less than ten
acres in size unless a conditional use permit for the existing wind energy
system is granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. All
conditional use permit applications and deposit fees will apply.
   (I)   Inspection required. A system must be inspected once every 36 months
by a third party inspector to assure that the system is working properly and
does not pose any adverse public safety issues. Inspections shall be at the
expense of the lot owner of record. Third party inspectors must be registered
with the City of Heath. The inspector, with the property owner’s endorsement,
shall file a report with the city which shall be kept on file in accordance
with City of Heath records retention policy.
   (J)   Conditional use permit.
      (1)   Any variation from regulations hereinafter adopted regarding wind

must be finally approved by City Council. Any decision by the City Council
regarding a request for a wind energy system, or variation thereof, is final.
      (2)   Compliance with technical requirements set forth in division (D)
above does not guarantee or necessitate approval of a request for a conditional
use permit by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council. Unique
characteristics of wind energy systems including their movement, size and noise
generation, potential for adverse impact on neighboring property owners as well
as all relevant provisions of the Code of Ordinances will be considered in
conjunction with a request for a conditional use permit.
      (3)   Following an administratively complete submission of an application
for a conditional use permit requesting a wind energy system, notices shall be
sent to all property owners of record within 200 feet of the boundaries in
accordance with state law except that a courtesy notice may be sent to

      (1)   Before acting upon any application for amendment, the City Council
shall hold a public hearing, notice of which hearing shall be published at
least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, not less than
15 days prior to the date of the hearing.
      (2)   Recommendations for revision or amendment of the ordinance,
including the zoning district map, may also be made by the Planning and Zoning
Commission upon its own motion, for final determination by the City Council.
Likewise, the City Council may revise, modify or amend the ordinance, including
the zoning district map, upon its own motion, provided however, the proposed
changes shall first be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for
recommendation and report. In either case, final action thereon shall be taken
only upon notice and hearing, as provided herein.
      (3)   In case of a written protest against the change, signed by the
owners of 20% or more, either of the area of the lots or land included in the
proposed change, or of the lots or land immediately adjoining the same and
extending 200 feet therefrom, or if the change is denied by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the change shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the City Council of Heath.
      (4)   The City Council shall, unless otherwise stated in the motion, make
all denials of zone changes with prejudice. If the request is denied with
prejudice, no additional application shall be accepted which involves all or
any part of the property within a period of 12 months except:
         (a)   At the request of the City Council; and
         (b)   On written request by the applicant to the City Council, with
pertinent facts which the City Council may deem sufficient to warrant a new
hearing. The request shall not be set for public hearing unless approved by a
majority vote of the City Council. If a rehearing is granted by the City
Council, then the procedure thereon will be the same as that given an original
application for zoning change filed with the Commission.
      (5)   For joint hearings, the City Council may hold a public hearing,
after publishing the required notice, jointly and with any public hearing
required to be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission, but the City Council
shall not take action until it has received a final report from the Planning
and Zoning Commission.

the following words:
“This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in Section
1.3 of the Ordinance Number 890316A of the City of Heath, Texas, (together with
the date of the adoption of this subchapter). If, in accordance with the
provisions of this subchapter and Tex. Local Gov’t. Code, Ch. 211, as amended,
changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the
official zoning map, such changes shall be entered on the official zoning map
promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council.”
      (2)   All changes made in the official zoning map will also note on the
map the ordinance number and date of final passage of the ordinance authorizing
the map change. No amendment to this subchapter which involves matter portrayed
on the official zoning map shall become effective until after the change and
entry has been made on the map.
      (3)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map
or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in
this subchapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or
persons shall be considered a violation of this subchapter and punishable as
provided for hereafter.
      (4)   Regardless of the existence of copies of the official zoning map
which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map,
which shall be located in the office of the City Secretary shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings,
and other structures in the city.
      (5)   In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature and/or number
of changes and additions, the City Council may, by resolution, adopt a new
official zoning map, which shall supersede the prior official zoning map, but
no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official
zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map
shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City
Secretary, and bearing the seal of the city and date under the following words:
“This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the
original official zoning map referred to Section 1.3 of Ordinance No. 890316A
of the City of Heath, Texas.”
      (6)   Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost or has been
totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining,
shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its
adoption or amendment.
   (B)   Rules of interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty
exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map,
the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines;
      (2)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed following the lot lines;
      (3)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall
be construed as following such city limits;
      (4)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be midway between the rails of the main tracks;
      (5)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline. Boundaries indicated as
approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or
other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines;
      (6)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in divisions (B)(1) through (5) above shall be so construed.
Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be
determined by the scale of the map;
      (7)   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances
not covered by divisions (B)(1) through (6) above, the Board of Adjustments
shall interpret the district boundaries;
      (8)   When streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or
alleys shown on the zoning district map, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
apply the district designations on the map to the streets or alleys on the
ground in such a manner as to conform to the intent and purpose of this
subchapter; and
      (9)   Whenever any street or alley is vacated, the particular district in
which the adjacent property lies shall be automatically extended to the center
line of any such street or alley.
(2005 Code, § 12-11-2)
§ 159.82 CLASSIFICATION OF NEW AND UNLISTED USES.
   It is recognized that new types of land use will develop and forms of land
use not anticipated may seek to locate in the City of Heath. In order to
provide for the changes and contingencies a determination as to the appropriate
classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made as
follows:
   (A)   Any question concerning any new or unlisted use shall be referred to
the Planning and Zoning Commission requesting an interpretation as the zoning
classification into which the use should be placed. The referral of the use
interpretation question shall be accompanied by a statement of facts listing
the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales
processing, type of product, storage, and amount or nature thereof, enclosed or
open storage, anticipated employment, transportation requirements, the amount
of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be
generated and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and
sanitary sewer;
   (B)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the nature and
described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the
purpose of and the uses permitted in the various districts within which the use
should be permitted;
   (C)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit its findings and
recommendations to the City Council as to the classification proposed for any
new or unlisted use. The City Council shall by resolution approve the
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission or make such determination
concerning the classification of the use as is determined appropriate; and
   (D)   The City Council may provide for temporary uses in any zoning district
deemed appropriate for those uses under conditions, regulations or restrictions
as required by Council.
