clause, sentence, paragraph, or section of this Code shall be declared
unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining
phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this Code, since the
same would have been enacted by the City Council without the incorporation in
this Code of any unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph,
provision, subsection, or section.
Â§ 10.12 Altering Or Tampering With Code
Â Â Â It shall be an offense for any person to change or amend, by addition or

whatsoever which will cause a law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.

the name and address of the officer holding such property, and a statement
indicating that if the owner does not claim the property within six (6) months

reasonable expense of keeping such property and the costs of such sale. If the
claim is denied by the City Council or the City Council fails to act upon such

Code, Â§ 43.028 and execute a written agreement providing minimum requirements

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The city reserves the right to furnish such customers it deems
advisable, and to, at any time wholly or partially discontinue the utility

its utility system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In the event of a relocation or the construction of a permanent
line or main, the property owner shall pay the pro rata cost on his or her

reached.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The City Council may, if in their judgement it is deemed advisable,

unable to drive such vehicle, such officer shall request the owner to designate
on a wrecker selection form the wrecker company the owner desires to remove the
vehicle. Such designation by the owner shall be indicated on said form and when

the authorization thus made on the form to the owner and shall retain for
record the original thereof. Upon leaving duty on the same day, the police
officer shall place such original in a well-bound book in the police department

of such procedure shall be charged against the owner and shall thereupon become

situated and make the same a lien thereon.
Â§ 94.34 Filing Statement Of Expenses; Lien

forth. Should the owner fail or refuse to pay the amount due within thirty (30)
days thereafter, the affidavit containing the information as set out

improvements, and the amount remaining unpaid on said statement shall accrue
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of
expenditure by the city, or from the date that the city itself performed such
work and incurred said expense, as provided for in V.T.C.A., Health & Safety

to persons or property or to provoke disorderly conduct or create a
disturbance;

to the general public to justify any inconvenience it may cause;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The event has been planned to ensure that the general safety,
health, and welfare of all persons is provided as is reasonably possible.

shall then issue a permit to the applicant.

Dangerous And Substandard Buildings
Â§ 150.60 Dangerous And Substandard Buildings Defined And Prohibited
Â Â Â Any building as described and defined in this section shall be and the same
is declared to be a public nuisance and unlawful:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any building with roof, ceiling, floors, sills, or foundations, or
any combination thereof rotted or decayed and falling apart; windows out,
uninhabitable, untenable, and unsightly, due to obsolescence and deterioration
caused by neglect or vandalism or fire damage or old age or the elements; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any building in danger of falling and injuring a person or property
of another; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any building which is a fire menace by being in a dilapidated
condition as described in subsections (1) and (2) hereof and which has an
accumulation of rubbish and trash which is likely to become a fire, or to be
set on fire, in and around said building and endanger the person or property of
others; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Any building which is in the condition or conditions described in
subsections (1), (2), or (3) hereof which is damp and in an unsanitary
condition and which is likely to create disease and sickness.
Â Â Â When used in this ordinance the term "building" shall include any structure
of any kind or any part thereof.
Â§ 150.61 Inspection
Â Â Â The building inspector and his assistants are hereby authorized to conduct
inspections of buildings suspected of being in violation of Â§
150.60.
Â§ 150.62 Notice To Owner
Â Â Â Whenever a violation of Â§
150.60 has been discovered and reported by an inspector, the owner of the
premises involved and the occupant, if any, shall be given written notification
of the nature of the violation and the date on which a reinspection shall be
made to determine if the violation has been eliminated. No reinspection shall
be made until the person responsible for a violation under the provisions of
this ordinance has been given a reasonable time to eliminate the violation.
Â§ 150.63 Notice To Demolish
Â Â Â Whenever a violation of Â§
150.60 is discovered upon reinspection and the violation presents an immediate
danger of injury to the occupants of the premises or to an adjoining property
or persons or to the public and the cost of alleviating the violation is not
reasonably related to the value of the building, a notice of intent to order
the demolition of the building shall be served on the owner by the building
inspector, by certified mail, to the post office address of the owner as the
same is shown on the city tax rolls; or, if his address is unknown and cannot
by the exercise of reasonable diligence be ascertained, then notice shall be by
publication for not less than two (2) times within ten (10) consecutive days in
the official newspaper of the city. Such notice shall state a time for the
public hearing to be had before the City Council for a determination of whether
or not violation exists. If such a violation is found to exist and if the
violation is not eliminated within thirty (30) days from the date of said
hearing, the city may demolish and remove said building or cause the same to be
done and charge the expenses incurred in doing such work or having the same
done to the owner of said land. If such work is done at the expense of the
city, then the said expense shall be assessed against any salvage resulting
from the demolition of the building and against the lot, tract, or parcel of
land, or the premises upon which such expense was incurred. For the purposes of
this section, any repair, alteration, or improvement which is determined by the
building inspector to cost more than fifty percent (50%) of the gross assessed
valuation of the building, exclusive of land value, shall be deemed not to be
reasonably related to the value of the building. The city may elect to obtain a
judicial determination by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction of the
existence, in fact, of a public nuisance. Such judicial determination may
include any available remedy for the abatement of such a nuisance. In the event
the municipality elects to obtain abatement of the nuisance through judicial
decree, it shall be unnecessary to serve the owner with a notice to demolish.
Â§ 150.64 Assessment Of Lien
Â Â Â The building inspector of the city shall file a statement of such expenses
incurred in the demolition or removal of the building, giving the amount of
such expense, the date on which said work was done or improvements made, with
the county clerk. The city shall have a privileged lien on such lot, lots, or
other premises or real estate upon which said building was located, to secure
the expenditure so made. Said lien shall be second only to tax liens and liens
for street improvements; and said amount shall bear ten (10) percent interest
from the date such statement is filed. It is further provided that for any such
expenditure and interest, as aforesaid, suit may be instituted and recovered,
and foreclosure of said lien may be made in the name of the city. The statement
of expenses so made or a certified copy thereof shall be prima facie proof of
the amount expended for such work or expense.

Authorization and Purpose
Â§ 151.01 Statutory Authorization
Â Â Â The City Council of Chico, Texas, does hereby adopt and implement the
following regulations for flood damage prevention.
Editorâs note:
Â Â Â State law reference - City has exclusive responsibility to minimize flood
losses, as legislated by V.T.C.A., Water Code, Â§ 16.315.
(Ord. 3-06-07-1, passed 3-6-07)
Â§ 151.02 Findings of Fact
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City of Chico, Texas, are subject to
periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 3-06-07-1, passed 3-6-07)
Â§ 151.03 Statement of Purpose
Â Â Â It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Protect human life and health;
Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 3-06-07-1, passed 3-6-07)
Â§ 151.04 Methods of Reducing Flood Loss
Â Â Â In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage;
Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 3-06-07-1, passed 3-6-07)
Â§ 151.05 Definitions
Â Â Â When used in this chapter the following words and terms shall be interpreted
as follows, unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Â Â Â Accessory structure (see Appurtenant structure)
Â Â Â Alluvial fan flooding refers to flooding occurring on the surface of an
alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is
characterized by high-velocity flows, active processes of erosion, sediment
transport and deposition, and unpredictable flow paths.
Â Â Â Apex is a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow
path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
Â Â Â Appurtenant structure  refers to a structure which is on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
Â Â Â Area of future conditions flood hazard  denotes the land area that would be
inundated by the one (1)-percent (1% )-annual chance (one hundred [100] year)
flood based on future conditions hydrology.
Â Â Â Area of shallow flooding  refers to a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO
zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%)
or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three
(3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).
After detailed rate-making has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR,
AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
Â Â Â Base flood refers to the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Â Â Â Basement is any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
Â Â Â Breakaway wall is a wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under
specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion
of the building or supporting foundation system.
Â Â Â Critical facility is a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, and installations which produce, use or store hazardous
materials or hazardous waste.
Â Â Â Critical feature  refers to an integral and readily identifiable part of a
flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the
entire system would be compromised.

which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation
walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
Â Â Â Existing construction refers to, for the purposes of determining rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective
date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that
date. Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures.
Â Â Â Existing manufactured home park or subdivision is a manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Â Â Â Flood elevation study denotes an examination, evaluation and determination
of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations,
or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (mudflow) and/or
flood-related erosion hazards.
Â Â Â Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) is an official map of a community, issued
by the Administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (mudflow)-
related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as Zones A,
M, and/or E.
Â Â Â Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) is an official map of a community, on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated both the special
flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Â Â Â Flood Insurance Study (FIS) (see Flood Elevation Study)
Â Â Â Floodplain or flood-prone area refers to any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding).

regulations.
Â Â Â Floodplain management regulations are zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special-purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and/or erosion control
ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such
state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards
for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
Â Â Â Flood protection system refers to those physical structural works for which
funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the area within a community subject to a âspecial flood hazardâ and the extent
of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized
flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound
engineering standards.
Â Â Â Floodproofing denotes any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
Â Â Â Floodway (see Regulatory floodway)
Â Â Â Functionally dependent use is a use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship
repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.

designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to
contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from
temporary flooding.
Â Â Â Levee system  is a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
Â Â Â Lowest floor denotes the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of Â§ 60.3 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.
Â Â Â Manufactured home is a structure transportable in one or more sections,

Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
Â Â Â New construction refers to, for the purpose of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, new construction  denotes structures for which
the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
Â Â Â New manufactured home park or subdivision is a manufactured home park or

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The first placement of permanent construction of a structure on
a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
refers to the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Â Â Â Structure is, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed
building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above
ground, as well as a manufactured home.
Â Â Â Substantial damage refers to damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed forty percent (40%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
Â Â Â Substantial improvement denotes any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds forty percent (40%) of the market value of the structure before "start
of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions ; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
Â Â Â Variance is a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see Â§ 60.6 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.)
Â Â Â Violation refers to the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Â§Â§ 60.3(b)(5), (c)
(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance
Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
Â Â Â Water surface elevation is the height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.

Â§ 151.23 Variance Procedures
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The Appeal Board, as established by the community, shall hear and
render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) upon request.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in Â§
151.22(2) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/
2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of Â§
151.03 of this chapter.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Prerequisites for granting variances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Showing a good and sufficient cause;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The criteria outlined in Â§Â§
151.23(a) through (i) are met; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two
(2.0) feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer,
architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Floodplain
Administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Â§
151.22(a)(1), is satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Nonresidential ConstructionÂ 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to two (2.0) feet above the base flood level or
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that
below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or
review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and
shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of
such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
Floodplain Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Enclosures
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles,
building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a

vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Critical Facilities
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA, preferably outside the 0.2%
annual chance floodplain. Construction of new critical facilities may be
permissible within the SFHA if feasible alternative sites are unavailable.
Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor
elevated three (3.0) feet above the base flood elevation at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes

City Council shall require, and to this end may be amended from time to time
until finally approved or disapproved. It shall also contain such information,
offers, obligations, and undertakings as the applicant sees fit to provide,
make, or assume. Upon approval such application and the permit issued
thereunder shall constitute a binding contract as between the city and the
applicant, which contract shall inure to the benefit of all land or mineral
owners concerned. However, all drilling ordinances of the city shall be deemed
to be part and parcel of the contract, which shall to that extent be subject to
amendment where required in the public interest as provided in Â§
170.30. Among other things the application should contain, unless good cause to
the contrary be shown, the following: Date and signature by applicant or his
authorized agent; applicant's full name and address; types of proposed drilling
operation and depth; approximate starting date of drilling operations and
duration thereof; and the full names, addresses, and signatures of all persons
or firms who are to be the "operators" of such well as that term is herein
defined. "Operator" of the well or lease shall have the meaning as generally
understood in the petroleum industry in Texas, shall be the person or firm
actively in charge of the well and all operations thereon, shall be and include
all persons who are to be liable to the city for the proper conduct of such
operations in accordance with the terms of the application, permit, and
drilling ordinances as amended or to be amended, or to the landowners entitled
to the benefits of such contract; and all "operators" shall be covered and
included by and under all bonds, insurance policies, and other obligations
hereunder.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â In addition, where the application is for a drilling permit on
"undeveloped portions" of the city, it shall contain the following: Description
of the drilling block proposed to be drilled, by plat and field notes; names of
all landowners (including owners of several mineral estates) within the
proposed drilling block; whether all have executed oil and gas leases or

shown by the application; names and addresses of all applicant's associates or
co-owners of such working interest holding substantial interest therein,
regardless whether they are co-operators as that term is hereinabove defined;
and proposed site of the well, to be indicated on the plat. The application
shall expressly acknowledge that applicant has procured a copy of all drilling
ordinances of the city, as amended, read and understood the same, and that the
"operators" agree to be bound thereby; and it may state any further proposals,
alternatively or otherwise, which it desires to have accepted and deems to be
in the best interest of the applicant, the city, all mineral owners involved,
and the public.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Where the application is for a permit to drill on the "developed
portion" of the city, it shall contain the following information, in addition

greater amount of acreage under lease so far as known to applicant; names and
addresses of all co-operators, if any, and all co-owners of the working
interest; and proposed site of the well, to be indicated on the Official
Drilling Plat. Such application shall also contain the matters specified in the
final sentence of division (b), immediately preceding.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.07 Issuance or refusal of permit
Â Â Â The City Council within 20 days after filing of the application shall act
thereon. If the application be not approved, and permit issued, it shall be
deemed to have been refused. In the event of refusal, or in the event of
withdrawal of application prior to the granting of the permit, the filing fee
shall be returned to the applicant, except that the city shall retain therefrom
$100.00 as a processing fee. After approval and issuance of permit, no part of
the filing fee shall ever be returned, except in cases of extreme inequity or
hardship, in the discretion of the City Council. The permit shall contain and
specify all terms upon which it is granted; all proposals of the application
which are approved; shall specify the length of time during which it shall be
in effect, which shall not be less than set out in the application nor longer
than one year, except that it may provide for extension thereof during periods
of substantially continuous drilling or re-working operations, and periods of
production in paying quantities, as the City Council shall determine; shall
specify all further actions required of the applicant before actual drilling
operations may be commenced; and shall be signed by the Mayor, attested by the
City Secretary under the seal of the city. Under such signatures, it shall
contain a certificate, to be executed by the City Oil and Gas Inspector or
other designated officer or officers, to the effect that all requirements made
in the permit as prerequisites to actual drilling have been complied with. Such
certificates shall, when executed and dated, constitute the applicant's
authority to commence actual drilling; and the term of the permit shall run
from such date. The permit shall likewise specify the terms under which the
same may be cancelled or may terminate, for failure promptly to commence
drilling operations or otherwise to comply with any requirement; and the
acceptance of same by applicant shall be evidenced by his signature thereon in
duplicate original copies, one of which shall be retained by each party.

Â§ 170.08 Permittee's insurance and bond
Â Â Â In the event a permit be issued by the City Council under the terms of this
chapter for the drilling and operation of a well, no actual drilling operations
shall be commenced until the permittee shall file with the City Secretary of
the city a bond and a certificate of insurance, as follows:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A bond in the principal sum of such number of dollars as has
been so determined by the City Council, but not to be less than $50,000.00. The
bond shall be executed by a reliable indemnity company authorized to do
business in the state, as surety, and with the applicant as principal, running
to the city for the benefit of the city and all persons concerned, conditioned
that the permittee will comply with the terms and conditions of this chapter in
the drilling and operation of the well. The bond shall become effective on or
before the date the same is filed with the City Secretary and remain in force
and effect for at least a period of six (6) months subsequent to the expiration
of the term of the permit issued, and in addition the bond shall be conditioned
that the permittee will promptly pay all fines, penalties and other assessments
imposed upon the permittee by reason of his breach of any of the terms,
provisions and conditions of this chapter, and that the permittee will promptly
restore the streets and sidewalks and other public property of the city, which
may be disturbed or damaged in the operations, to their former condition; and
that the permittee will promptly clear all premises of all litter, trash, waste
and other substances used, allowed, or occurring in the drilling or producing
operations, and will, after abandonment, grade, level, and restore the property
to the same surface condition, as nearly as possible, as existed when
operations for the drilling of the well or wells were first commenced, to the
satisfaction of the City Council; and that the permittee will indemnify and
hold the city harmless from any and all liability growing out of or
attributable to the granting of such permit. If at any time the City Council
shall deem any permittee's bond to be insufficient for any reason, it may
require the permittee to file a new bond.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If, after completion of a well, the permittee has complied with all
of the provisions of this chapter, such as to removing the derrick, clearing
premises, and the like, he may apply for the City Council to have the bond
reduced to a sum of not less than $25,000.00 for the remainder of the time the
well produces without reworking. During reworking operations the amount of the
bond shall be increased to the original amount.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In addition to the bond required in division (a) of this
section, the permittee shall carry a policy or policies of standard
comprehensive public liability insurance, including contractual liability
covering bodily injuries and property damage, naming the permittee and the city
in an insurance company authorized to do business within the state. The policy
or policies in the aggregate shall provide for the following minimum coverages:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Bodily injuries; $100,000.00 one person.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â Property damage; $500,000.00
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The permittee shall file with the City Secretary certificates of
the insurance as above stated, and shall obtain the written approval thereof by
the Mayor of the city, who shall act thereon within ten (10) days from the date
of such filing. The insurance policy or policies shall not be cancelled without
written notice to the City Secretary at least ten (10) days prior to the
effective date of such cancellation. In the event that the insurance policy or
policies are cancelled, the permit granted shall terminate, and the permittee's
rights to operate under the permit shall cease until the permittee files
additional insurance as provided herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If after completion of a well, the permittee has complied with all
of the provisions of this chapter such as removing the derrick, clearing
premises, and the like, he may apply to the City Council to have the insurance
policies reduced as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Bodily injuries; $50,000.00 per person;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â Property damage; $250,000.00 one accident; for the remainder of
the time the well produces without reworking. During reworking operations, the
amount of the insurance policy or policies shall be increased to the original
amount.

well to a deeper depth than that reached in the prior drilling operations
without the permittee as to the well obtaining a supplemental permit after
filing a supplemental application with the City Secretary specifying the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The then condition of the well and casing therein;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The depth to which it is proposed such well be deepened, not to

Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Evidence of adequate current tests showing that the casing strings
in the well currently pass the same tests as are in this chapter provided for
in case of the drilling of the original well.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â In the event that City Council is satisfied that the well may be
deepened with the same degree of safety as existed in the original well, a
supplemental permit may be issued without additional filing fee to the
permittee authorizing the deepening and operation of the well to such specified
depth as applied for, not exceeding in any event a total true vertical depth
from the surface in excess of twelve thousand (12,000) feet. In any deeper
drilling or any deeper completion or any deeper production operations, the
permittee shall comply with all other provisions contained in this chapter and
applicable to the drilling, completion, and operation of a well or wells.

horizon, whichever is the lesser depth, the weight of the mud-laden drilling
fluid shall be at all times maintained at not less than ten (10) pounds per
gallon. After the well reaches a total depth of 5,000 feet or the depth of the
first known or encountered oil or gas-bearing horizon, whichever is the lesser
depth, the weight of the mud-laden drilling fluid shall be at all times
maintained at such weight as will provide a hydrostatic head of not less than
five hundred (500) pounds per square inch in excess of the formation pressure.
In reworking a well, a drilling fluid shall be at all times maintained at such
weight as will provide a hydrostatic head of not less than five hundred (500)
pounds per square inch in excess of the formation pressure.

(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Penalty, see Â§ 170.99
Â§ 170.29 City policy
Â Â Â It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to encourage by all
appropriate means the development of the territory within and adjacent to the
corporate limits for oil, gas and mineral purposes. All such drilling and
development shall, however, be performed in strict compliance with all
requirements of this chapter and of all other ordinances heretofore or
hereafter adopted by the city, in order to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the inhabitants of the city, and particularly the public water
supply thereof.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.30 Limitations on permits; cancellation
Â Â Â No permit to drill or operate a well hereafter granted by the city under
terms of any drilling ordinance shall be deemed to grant a vested right, but
each such permit shall provide that it is issued subject to all future
amendments of this chapter and all other ordinances or regulations that may be
adopted hereafter by the city, to all future laws adopted by the state, and to
all regulations adopted by the Railroad Commission of Texas; and that violation
of any of same shall, when determined, after five (5) days' notice and hearing
by the City Council be grounds for cancellation of any such permit, and
operations thereunder shall cease immediately as of the time of such
cancellation so made by the City Council.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.31 Drilling near municipal water wells

designated future municipal water well of the city shall have casing set and
cemented down to the first impervious stratum below the Trinity Sand formation;
and similar casing shall be set and cemented on wells located at greater
distances from such water wells when requested by the City Council. The
requirement may be waived by the City Council for good cause shown after due
hearing; but if not waived by the City Council may be enforced by injunction or
any other available remedy. No drilling permit shall ever be issued to any
person, firm, or corporation for the drilling or operation of any well, when
such person, firm, or corporation is in default hereunder; and any such permit
inadvertently issued shall be deemed wholly void from the beginning.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.32 Administration by City Council
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The City Council is hereby designated as the agency to administer this
chapter. All drilling ordinances and amendments shall be brought to the
attention of the public by any appropriate means; and the publication of notice
of the adoption of same in the official newspaper of the city, The Chico Texan,
and the filing of certified copies of the full ordinance or extracts thereof in
the Official Lease Records of Wise County, Texas, in the Office of the County
Clerk of the County, are declared to be appropriate means. The provisions
hereof shall nevertheless be binding on all persons, regardless of actual
notice thereof.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â After the effective date of any such ordinance, the City Council shall
have power to accept applications for any waiver, permit, amendment, change,
modification of boundary lines as herein provided or shown on the attached
plat, or any other order expressly provided or impliedly contemplated herein or
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and policies hereof; to set a
day and time for hearing thereon; to issue such notice as it deems appropriate
to any such hearing; to hear evidence thereon; to make findings germane
thereto; and to enter such order or orders, granting or denying any relief
sought hereunder in whole or in part, as it shall deem proper hereunder.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â No suit shall be brought against the city or any party hereunder until
such issue shall have first been so submitted to the City Council and by it
acted on, after which any party aggrieved may institute his suit in any court
having jurisdiction. For the violation of this provision any party shall
immediately lose all rights under any permit or other order granted by the
city, and no further permits or rights shall be granted to such party
hereunder. The procedure in any such hearing shall be prescribed by the City
Council, shall be informal, and shall be determined at discretion of the City
Council in any manner which does not violate the principles of due process of
law nor invade unjustly the rights of any party, or in any manner to which the
parties and the city may stipulate.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â It is the intention of the City Council hereby to constitute itself a
general regulatory agency with power to regulate and control all questions
pertaining to such drilling and operation of oil and gas wells within the city,
which may substantially involve the health, safety or welfare of the
inhabitants of the city; and under the same conditions to regulate such
drilling and the manner thereof outside but adjacent or approximate to the
corporate limits of the city so far as lawfully possible; all such jurisdiction
however to be exercised concurrently with and subject to, and in a manner not
in conflict with, the jurisdiction or regulations of the Railroad Commission of
Texas or other lawful regulatory agencies of the State of Texas or of the
United States.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.33 Drilling plat; "developed" and "undeveloped portions"
Â Â Â The "developed portion" and the "undeveloped portion" of the city are hereby
declared to be and are defined as the same appear on the plat attached to
Ordinance 39817, passed 10-2-79, which is designated as and may be referred to
as "The Official Drilling Plat" of the city. In so far as possible the boundary
lines between such portions are so drawn, and may be from time to time re-
drawn, so as to include within the "developed portion" all territory within the
city which is subdivided by streets or ways actually opened on the ground into
lots and blocks, which is substantially all improved or built up, and which is
substantially all used for residential, business, and like purposes; and so as
to include within the "undeveloped portion" all other territory within the
city. All drilling ordinances and regulations of the city shall apply to the
one, or to the other, or to both, in accordance with the expressed or clearly
implied intent of the Council, the purposes and objects of such provisions, or
as shall be from time to time declared by the City Council acting as a
regulatory agency, in accordance with the expressed policies hereof.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.34 Formation of drilling blocks in "undeveloped" and "developed portions"
of city
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For the purpose of this section, a drilling block is defined as
a tract of land containing 320 acres, plus or minus 10% tolerance thereof, all
ownerships within which are contiguous and enclosed within the boundary line of
such block.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All of the requirements of the Railroad Commission for the
formation of a drilling block, or "gas unit" or "production unit" shall apply
to formation of a drilling block in the city. The formation of such drilling
blocks in undeveloped portions of the city shall be accomplished by the private
contract of the parties in interest, save and except drilling permits shall not
be issued for any such block where the boundaries of same are so drawn as to
exclude any tract or ownership from feasible inclusion in any present or future
drilling block or feasible participation in production in any present or future
block, until it be shown that the owner of such tract or ownership has been
extended opportunity for such inclusion and participation on the most favorable
terms offered to any other owner therein and has refused the same. The purpose
of this clause is to protect the rights of such ownerships to participation in
some drilling block, and to avoid so far as possible the necessity of granting
additional permits for drilling, on sites of less than 320 acres plus or minus
10% tolerance, as exceptions to the general spacing rule herein established,
and the consequent hazards to the public health, safety, and welfare.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Drilling blocks shall be formed within the developed portion of the
city, however, in the manner and with boundaries as shown on the attached
Official Drilling Plat of the city; and the same are hereby created and
declared to exist as therein shown. It is further provided, by way of
identification and description only, that the same shall be five (5) in number,
designated, bounded, and with surface acreage as shown on the plat and the
field notes thereto appended.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.35 Estates of landowners
Â Â Â It is recognized and ordained that the landowners of the city in the absence
of their own contractual agreement of conveyance to the contrary have the
following estates in and to the land: An expense-bearing seven-eighths (7/8)
working interest, or "leasehold estate" and a free royalty interest, equivalent
to one-eighth (1/8) of all minerals produced, saved and sold from his land,
free of cost. In the absence of conveyance or contract to the contrary, the
landowner shall always have and be entitled to a free royalty of 1/8 of the
minerals produced and saved from the drilling block in proportion that the
surface area owned by the landowner bears to the total surface area in the
drilling block.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.36 Rights of landowners in "developed portion" of city
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any ownership (intending that the term shall include ownership
of any mineral, royalty, leasehold, or other estate in or to the oil, gas, and
minerals in and under any part of any drilling block upon which a permit has
been issued) shall participate in the proceeds of production under such permit
according to one or the other of the following alternatives, as such owner may
elect:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â He shall receive royalties and other benefits on the production
attributable to his ownership interest, whether whole or fractional, under the
provisions of Â§
170.35 hereof, or on the same basis as the most favorable terms granted by the
permittee to any other owner within the drilling block if the latter provides a
greater royalty or benefit than set forth in Â§
170.35. If he elects this alternative such owner shall be deemed to have
adopted the status of "lessor", and the permittee as to him that of "lessee",
as those terms are known to the law of Texas relating to oil, gas and mineral
leases, with the terms of the lease to be those stated in this drilling chapter
as amended, in the application for a drilling permit, and in the drilling
permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â He shall receive the full 8/8 share of production attributable
to his ownership, after deduction of his proportionate part of all expenses of
drilling, acquiring, producing, maintaining, and operating the lease and well
and marketing the product thereof. If he elects this alternative he shall be
deemed to have adopted the legal status of a co-owner of the leasehold estate
or working interest, as that term is known to the law, and shall bear all of
the obligations and liabilities thereto appertaining, except that this shall
not diminish the obligations of the permittee or "operator", as that term is
herein defined, to the city, nor shall the city ever have to look to any person
other than such permittee for fulfillment of all conditions of the permit.
Under this alternative the permittee shall be entitled to make reasonable
requirements for the proper securing by such owner of the payments and
obligations assumed by owner hereunder; and if the owner shall fail to advance
such sums of cash, bonds, and other such security, the permittee shall be
entitled to receive the owner's share or part of production until he has
recovered all of the owner's share of drilling costs and costs of equipping and
completing the well, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per
annum, and shall then be entitled to receive a further sum equal to the first
(before calculation of interest) to be held as security for the performance by
the owner of his further obligations and liabilities hereunder; and shall
thereafter pay to owner his 8/8 share of production attributable to the owner's
interest after deducting current operating and marketing costs. Provided, if
any person owns less than the full 8/8 interest in the minerals under any such
tract, his rights and obligations hereunder shall be proportionately
diminished.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Provided further, the owner of any mineral interest of any
character may, if he deems the inclusion of his interest in such drilling block
under any such permit to be unjust for any reason, make application to the City
Council to exclude the same, which application shall be acted on under such
regulations as the City Council may adopt.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Records of the adoption by owners of the alternative as provided in
division (a)(1)(i) above shall be kept and maintained in the city hall by the
City Secretary, whether such adoption be express or deemed and implied
hereunder. No form of such adoption or record thereof is herein specified, nor
shall the same be defeated by any informality therein, so long as it appears
affirmatively that the owner acquiesces in the issuance of such drilling permit
and the distribution of royalties and proceeds of production by the permittee
in accordance with this chapter, the application, and the drilling permit.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â In further clarification of the alternative provided in division (a)
(1)(ii), an owner so electing the same shall so far as necessary to any
determination of disputes as between the owner and the permittee be deemed to
have entered into a mining partnership with the permittee, as that term is
known to the law of the state.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.37 Notice to landowners in "developed portion" of city
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Notice of such alternative rights may be given by the permittee to
owners from whom the permittee holds no authorization or lease as above
provided, at any time, before or after drilling.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Notice shall contain references to all drilling ordinances, to the
application for the permit and the permit to drill; shall briefly explain the
two alternatives set forth in Â§
170.36 of this chapter; and shall call upon the owner to make his election
within 20 days from the date of publishing the notice. The form of notice shall
be approved by the City Council.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Notice shall be served by being published in one issue of the official
newspaper of the city, after being issued by the City Secretary, and return
shall be made to him certifying to the fact and date of publication. Notice
shall also be served, if the owner's name and address are known (and the city's
tax rolls shall be conclusive thereon), by mailing a copy of the same by
certified mail with return receipt requested, same to be mailed on or before
the date of publication.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If such notice is given as provided in this section, and if at the
expiration of such 20 days no express election has been made by the owner, then
he shall be conclusively deemed to have accepted, adopted and approved the
alternative provided in Â§
170.36(a)(i) of this chapter.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)
Â§ 170.38 Limitation on number of wells
Â Â Â In the event oil in paying quantities should be discovered in any drilling
block as shown by the Official Drilling Plat, or for any other reason more than
one well shall be permitted and drilled within any such drilling block, the
entire drilling block shall be treated as and conclusively deemed attributable
proportionately to each and every lot or ownership within such drilling block.
It is the purpose of this section to limit the number of wells drilled within
such developed portion of the city to the smallest number of wells which will
suffice to fully and economically develop and produce the oil, gas, and
minerals thereunder, in the interests of the public health, safety, and
welfare.
(Ord. 39817, passed 10-2-79)

CHAPTER 175: CABLE TELEVISION RATE REGULATIONS
Section
Â Â Â 
175.01Â Â Â Basic tier rates
Â Â Â 
175.02Â Â Â Equipment and installation charges
Â Â Â 
175.03Â Â Â Approval of rates
Â§ 175.01 Basic tier rates
Â Â Â Upon review of Cablevision's Forms 1200, 1205 and 1220, and information
submitted by staff and the public, the city finds as follows regarding rates
for Cablevision's basic service tier in the city:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Cablevision has established that its cost of service pursuant to the
rules of the FCC for the proposed basic service tier is at least $34.31 for 50
basic tier channels.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The establishment of a single tier of basic service will serve the
public interest by placing all regulated services under the jurisdiction of the
city, and will improve the level and quality of service that Cablevision can
deliver to its subscribers. Moreover, the establishment of a single basic tier
will permit Cablevision to offer rate discounts to senior citizens as described
herein.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Because the basic tier rate justified by Cablevision's cost of service
showing is substantially higher than the rate currently charged for the
channels today, the city hereby approves an initial basic tier rate, effective
April 1, 1995, and subsequent rate increases to be phased in on an annual basis
between April 1, 1996 and March 31, 1999. Based on Cablevision's cost of
service showing, commencing April 1, 1995, the basic service tier rate shall be
$29.06. The city also approves annual rate increases in the amount of the
greater of $1.50, $1.75 and $2.00 effective no earlier than April 1, 1996, 1997
and 1998 respectively, or the sum of the Consumer Price Index change plus
external costs (excluding franchise fees and other FCC or governmental imposed
fees) in each immediately preceding calendar year. For example, the April 1,
1996 increase will be the greater of $1.50 or the sum of the 1995 Consumer
Price Index change plus Cablevision's 1995 increase in external costs
(excluding franchise fees and other FCC or governmental imposed fees), plus any
reset provided under division (f) of this section.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Because the rates identified in division (c) above are below
Cablevision's cost of providing service as indicated in division (a) above and
Cablevision's cost of service showing, Cablevision shall, at the request of the
city, report annually to the city the amount by which its revenues for basic
broadcast tier services falls short of the cost of providing the services.
These shortfalls shall be included as a rate base asset in any subsequent
analysis of its basic broadcast tier rates.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Commencing April 1, 1995, the Company shall charge senior citizens (65
years or older) $27.06 for the basic tier rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A discounted rate is available only for households where the head
of such household is 65 years or older. Eligible households shall be identified
by the city in writing to Cablevision.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Basic tier rates charged for the 12 months ending March 31,
1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 for all categories of subscribers shall result in
Cablevision receiving a âblended rateâ as of any reset date in each of the
years of 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 equal to $28.53 plus increases set forth in
division (c) above. The standard basic tier rates and the discounted senior
citizen basic tier rates set forth in divisions (c) and (e) above are based
upon projections of the number of senior citizens that will take advantage of
the basic tier rate in division (e). These projections are derived from
currently available census data for the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notwithstanding the basic tier rate set forth in division (e) above
and, in order that Cablevision receives the applicable blended rate,
Cablevision shall be entitled to reset the discounted basic tier rate charged
to senior citizens no more frequently than semiannually in accordance with the
following formula should the initial projections prove to be inaccurate:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â If more subscribers are eligible for and take advantage of the
discounts than anticipated, then an adjustment will be made to the amount of
the discount for seniors such that Cablevision is able to receive the blended
basic tier rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â If fewer subscribers are eligible for and take advantage of the
discounts, an adjustment will be made to the standard basic tier rate by
reducing the amount of the next scheduled standard basic tier rate increase in
order that Cablevision will be receiving no more than the appropriate blended
basic service tier rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â To illustrate this resetting mechanism, Â§
20.00 of the Fee Schedule (
Appendix I of this Code) sets forth examples of how the process of resetting
will be implemented under various scenarios.
(Ord. 2-95-1, passed 2-8-95)
Â§ 175.02 Equipment and installation charges
Â Â Â Upon review of Cablevision's rate submissions and information submitted by
city staff and the public, the city hereby approves the following equipment and
installation rates that have been found to comply with the FCC's maximum
permitted rates:
Â Â Â Additional outletÂ Â Â $0.00
Â Â Â Manual converterÂ Â Â 1.72
Â Â Â Remote converterÂ Â Â 2.05
Â Â Â Installations
Â Â Â Unwired houseÂ Â Â $46.99
Â Â Â Prewired houseÂ Â Â 31.33
Â Â Â Additional outlet (same trip)Â Â Â 25.06
Â Â Â Additional outlet (separate trip)Â Â Â 31.33
Â Â Â Change of serviceÂ Â Â $31.33/hour
Â Â Â Service callÂ Â Â $31.33/hour
Â Â Â These rates will be annually recomputed in accordance with FCC rules.
(Ord. 2-95-1, passed 2-8-95)
Â§ 175.03 Approval of rates
Â Â Â In conformance with, and by application of, the FCC's rules and regulations
regarding rate regulation, the basic service tier rate (including the senior
citizen rate and resetting mechanism) and the equipment and installation rates,
and increases thereof, set forth in Â§Â§
175.01 and
175.02 above are approved for Cablevision by the city. Any franchise fees, FCC
user or regulatory fees or any other tax, fee or assessment imposed by any
governmental authority on Cablevision shall be in addition to the rates
approved in Â§Â§
175.01 and
175.02. These rates and increases shall be applicable for the period commencing
on April 1, 1995 and terminating on March 31, 1999.

* No local fees are authorized during the three-year period following the
original issuance of the permit. When this schedule was compiled, House Bill
815 was pending before the 80th Legislature on the House Floor. The bill
proposes to add Chapter 29A to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code and create an
All-night Hotel Mixed Beverage Permit with a annual state fee of $1,000. The
local fee would then be $500. Like the other mixed beverage permits, local fees
would not be authorized during the three-year period following issuance.
** When this schedule was complied, House Bill 1667 had passed the Texas House
of Representatives and had been sent to the Texas Senate. The bill increases
the fees for a Wine and Beer Retailer's Permit and a Retail Dealer's On-Premise
License to $1,000 for the original application and sets a $750 annual renewal
fee. The local fees, if this bill passes, would then be $500 for the original
permit or license and $375 for each renewal.

Â Â Â Each monthly bill shall be adjusted for gas cost as follows:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The city gate rate applicable to current billing month sales shall be
calculated to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf based upon:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A volume factor of 1.0273 determined in establishing the above rate
for the distribution system as the ratio of adjusted purchased volumes divided
by adjusted sales volumes. Said factor shall be adjusted annually following

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Connection charge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â The following connection charges apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ScheduleÂ Â Â Â Â Â Charge
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Business hoursÂ Â Â $35.00

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â For each reconnection of gas service where service has been
discontinued at the same premises for any reason, for the inauguration of
service, and for each inauguration of service when the billable party has
changed, with the following exceptions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â For a builder who uses gas temporarily during construction or
for display purposes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Whenever gas service has been temporarily interrupted because
of system outage or service work done by the company; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â For any reason deemed necessary for company operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Returned check charge. A returned check handling charge sixteen
dollars and twenty-five cents ($16.25) is made for each check returned to the
company for any reason.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Read for change charge. A read for change charge of twelve dollars
($12) is made when it is necessary for a company employee to read the meter at
a currently served location because of a change in the billable party.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Delinquent notification charge. A charge of four dollars and
seventy-five cents ($4.75) shall be made for each trip by a company employee to
a customerâs residence or place of business when there is an amount owed to the
company that is past due. This charge shall not be made when the trip is
required for safety investigations or when gas service has been temporarily
interrupted because of system outage or service work done by the company.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Temporary discontinuance of service charge. Whenever service under
this rate schedule has been temporarily discontinued at the request of the
customer, a charge of forty-seven dollars ($47.00) for residential and seventy-
three dollars and seventy-five cents ($73.75) for commercial plus the
appropriate connection charge will be made to reestablish such service for that
customer at the same address.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Excess flow valve charges (residential).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â A customer may request the installation of an excess flow valve
on a new service line or on a service line being replaced provided that the
service line will serve a single residence and operate continuously throughout
the year at a pressure of not less than ten (10) psig. The customer will pay
the actual cost incurred to install the excess flow valve. That cost will
include the cost of the excess flow valve, the labor cost required to install
the excess flow valve, and other associated costs. The estimated total cost to
install an excess flow valve is fifty dollars ($50.00). This cost is based on
installing the excess flow valve at the same time a service line is installed
or replaced. The excess flow valve will be installed on the service line
upstream of the customer's meter and as near as practical to the main.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â A customer requiring maintenance, repair, or replacement of an
excess flow valve will be required to pay the actual cost of locating and
repairing or replacing the excess flow valve. The cost to perform this service
will normally range from two hundred dollars ($200) to two thousand dollars
($2,000), depending on the amount of work required. This cost will be
determined on an individual project basis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â This tariff is being filed in accordance with the U.S.
Department of Transportation rule requiring the installation of an excess flow
valve, if requested by a customer, on new or replaced service lines that
operate continuously throughout the year at a pressure of not less than ten
(10) psig and that serve a single residence. The rule further states that the
customer will bear all costs of installing and maintaining the excess flow
valve.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Main line extension rate. The charge for extending mains beyond the
limit established by the franchise for residential and commercial customers
shall be based on the actual cost per foot of the extension.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Recovery of connection costs associated with stand-by gas generators
(commercial). Commercial customers installing stand-by gas generators to
provide service in the event of an interruption in electric service in
facilities where gas service is not otherwise provided will reimburse TXU Gas
Distribution for the actual cost of acquiring and installing the regulator,
service line, and meter required to provide gas service for the stand-by
generators. Gas service provided for the stand-by generators will be billed at
the applicable commercial rate.
