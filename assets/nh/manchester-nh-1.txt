LEAD EXPOSURE PREVENTION COMMISSION
§ 32.150 FINDING OF FACT.
   The Board of Mayor and Aldermen find that:
   (A)   Lead is a neurotoxin and exposure at an early age does irreparable
harm to young children.
   (B)   There is no safe level of lead in the human body.
   (C)   Lead based paint was banned for use in residential dwellings in 1978.
Thus the age of housing is a significant risk factor. According to current
estimates, there are approximately 50,000 dwelling units in the city of
Manchester; of which 30,000 are estimated to have been built prior to 1979.
   (D)   Between 2016 and 2020, 465 children in Manchester were diagnosed with
blood lead levels greater than or equal to the state's current action level of
five micrograms per deciliter ("ug/dL"). Note: the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control has adopted 3.5 ug/dL as the recommended reference value.
   (E)   Lead poisoning results in societal costs including: increased special
education, health care, justice system and social assistance spending; reduced
lifetime productivity; and premature mortality.
   (F)   Since 2002, the City of Manchester has received over $18.4 million
funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
Department to make housing units 'lead safe' (in addition to city matching
funds).
   (G)   To date, 1170 units have utilized funding to remediate lead in a
manner consistent with state and federal regulations. It
is unknown how many property owners have taken steps to remediate lead on their
own, nor to what extent they follow regulated procedures.
   (H)   It is noteworthy that remediation does not constitute complete
elimination of lead hazards. In certain scenarios (such as remodeling,
reconstruction, or demolition), lead hazards that were considered remediated
will re-emerge, requiring additional and/or ongoing remediation measures.
   (I)   It is estimated that for every dollar spent to reduce lead poisoning
hazards, there is a societal return on investment of between $17 and $221.
   (J)   Childhood lead poisoning is preventable. Actions taken by the city to
emphasize primary prevention of lead exposures will protect the health of
Manchester's children, enabling them to reach their full potential, and avoid
the significant costs associated with childhood lead poisoning.
(Ord. passed 8-1-23)
§ 32.151 ESTABLISHED.

§ 33.042 SALARY OR WAGE INCREASES LIMITED BY APPROPRIATIONS.

('71 Code, § 18-33) (Ord. passed 6-14-67; Am. Ord. passed 11-4-98)
§ 33.044 BASIS OF SALARY RATES FOR FLSA EXEMPT EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   The annual, weekly and hourly rate prescribed in the schedules of the
compensation plan are based on full-time employment on the basis of 40 hours
per week and 52 weeks per year for the respective classes of positions as set
forth in the schedule of the classification plan; provided, however, that the
salaries of positions designated as administrative, executive or professional
exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are fixed according to the
responsibilities to be fulfilled and are not based on a fixed number of hours
of work per week and shall not be adjusted with variations in work schedules,
unless part-time employment is specifically provided and/or unless otherwise
approved by the Mayor and Human Resources and Insurance Committee. Employees in
positions designated as FLSA exempt and whose normal work week is less than 40
hours per week and whose normal work year is less than 52 weeks per year shall
have their pay and authorized sick leave and vacation time prorated to coincide
with the actual hours and actual weeks they are assigned to work per year.
   (B)   All regular, permanent, full-time salaried employees shall be paid the
weekly salaries prescribed in the schedules of the compensation plan for their
respective classes of positions.
   (C)   Salaries of temporary, seasonal, or part-time employees shall be
determined as provided in §§ 33.062, and 33.063 of this subchapter.

§ 33.045 BASIS OF PAY RATES FOR FLSA NON-EXEMPT POSITIONS.
   Any employee in a class of position indicated as “hourly basis” or FLSA non-
exempt in the schedule of the classification plan shall be paid hourly rates
prescribed herein for the respective class of position for time actually
worked, and for authorized sick leave, vacation, and holiday time, all of which
shall be based on the normal working hours established by the department head
with the approval of the Human Resources Director or the Human Resources and
Insurance Committee of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.
('71 Code, § 18-35) (Ord. passed 6-14-67; Am. Ord. passed 12-27-67; Am. Ord.
passed 11-4-98)
§ 33.046 ENTRANCE PAY RATES.
   (A)   Starting rate on initial employment. Original appointment to any
position shall be made at the entrance or minimum rate of the pay grade and
advancement from the entrance rate to the maximum rate within a pay range shall
be by successive steps. Department heads may approve initial compensation at
steps 2 through 5, dependent on budgetary constraints, when the needs of the
service so require; provided that any such exception is based on the
outstanding and unusual character of the employee's experience and ability over
and above the qualification requirements specified for the class, or that a
critical shortage of qualified applicants exist. In the latter case, any
incumbents in the same class performing identical duties and receiving a lower
rate shall have their rates increased to the rate established for entrance of
new employees. Upon recommendation of the department heads and the Human
Resources Director, or the Human Resources and Insurance Committee, the Mayor
may approve initial compensation at step 6 and above, also when the needs of
the service so require; provided that any such exception is based on the
outstanding and unusual character of the employee's experience, or that a
critical shortage of qualified applicants exist. Again, in the latter case, any
incumbents in the same class performing identical duties and receiving a lower
rate shall have their rates increased to the rate established for entrance of
new employees.
   (B)   Starting rate on return to duty. When an employee returns to duty in
the same class of positions after a separation from the city service of not
more than one year, which separation was not due to discreditable
circumstances, such employee shall receive a rate of pay that is within the
approved pay grade for the class.
   (C)   Starting rate on return from military service. Any employee who holds
a position that is expected to continue indefinitely or for a significant
period of time, and who is a member of the National Guard or of a reserve
component of the armed forces of the United States or who leaves employment and
enlists in the military within 90 days from termination from employment from
the city, shall be entitled to military leave when such duty is in conflict
with the employee's regular work schedule. Under the Federal Uniform Services
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, any reservist, member of the
National Guard or military who is returning from active duty lasting five years
or less with an honorable or general discharge, shall be guaranteed a position
equivalent to the position that the employee vacated to perform the active duty
unless the re-employment causes an undue hardship to the city pursuant to
U.S.C. 4312(d). The returning employee shall be placed in a step that he/she
would have attained had he/she not been on active duty.
   (D)   Starting rate in new positions. Whenever an employee is assigned to
duty in a position not previously held by him, and such change is in the nature
of a transfer and not in the nature of a promotion and the position is in the
same pay grade as the position currently held by the employee, the employee
shall receive no increase in pay but shall remain in the current step and shall
be eligible for a step increase on the employee's anniversary date just as if
the employee had been working in the current position.
   (E)   Rate of pay on promotion. In any case where an employee is promoted to
a class with a higher pay grade, the employee's pay shall be increased to at
least the minimum rate for the higher class, but such increase shall be no less
than 10% of the employee's current pay. In the case of overlapping pay grade
ranges, the promoted employee shall be increased to the step immediately above
the employee's current pay, but such increase shall be no less than 10% of the
employee's current pay. If the employee refuses the promotion, the Human
Resources Director may approve an additional pay step increase. If the employee
still refuses the promotion, the Human Resources and Insurance Committee may
approve two additional pay step increases. If the employee still refuses the
promotion, the Mayor may approve additional step increases as provided in §
33.046 above. Advancement to the maximum rates subsequent to promotion will
beon the same basis as described in
§ 33.048 of this subchapter. Effective dates for promotions shall be the first
work day following approval of the promotions.
   (F)   Rate of pay in cases of voluntary transfer to a lower pay grade. When
an employee takes a position at a lower salary grade, the employee shall be
demoted to the lower grade based upon his/her years of service. However, if the
years of service result in the employee receiving a step which compensates the
employee at a higher rate of pay than prior to the demotion, said employee
shall be placed in a step in the lower grade that does not exceed his/her level
of compensation prior to the demotion.
   (G)   When an employee's position is reclassified to a higher salary grade,
the employee shall be placed in the new grade at a step that would provide an
increase equaling at least one annual merit step increase in the former salary
grade. If an employee's position is reclassified to a lower salary grade, the
employee shall be placed at a step in the lower grade based upon his/her years
of full time employment. However, if the years of full service result in the
employee receiving a step which compensates the employee at a higher rate of
pay than prior to the reclassification, said employee shall be placed in a step
in the lower grade that does not exceed his/her level of compensation prior to
the reclassification.

§ 33.047 INITIAL PROBATIONARY PERIOD.

of service in the position shall be considered the initial probationary period,
except uniformed Fire Department personnel and police personnel whose initial
probationary periods shall be for 12 months.
   (B)   In the event an employee is not meeting the work standard, the
probationary period may be extended up to an additional six months not to
exceed a total of 12 months probation.
   (C)   In the event an employee does not meet the work standard at the
conclusion of the first six months or at the conclusion of the extended
probationary period, he or she shall be separated from service except in the
case of a promotional probationary period, all efforts will be made to return
said employee to his or her former position if such position is available.

   (A)   Initial hire. An employee whose entrance is at a rate of pay below the
maximum of the base range may be advanced one step in the appropriate range
effective the date of the successful completion of the initial probationary
period. Such advancement may be recommended by the department head and approved
by the Human Resources Director or Human Resources and Insurance Committee.
      (1)   Although police and fire personnel serve a 12 month initial
probationary period, such personnel shall be eligible for pay advancement after
six months of employment upon the recommendation of the department head.
   (B)   Step Increases. Full time employees may be advanced to the higher
rates within the range as recommended by the department head and approved by
the Human Resources Director or the Human Resources and Insurance Committee,
based upon their job performance and length of service except as otherwise
provided for in collective bargaining agreements. Such advancement may be made
yearly until the employee has reached the maximum base rate of the class grade
for the position. The Human Resources Director shall develop a standardized
form and process for use by the department heads in evaluating employees' work
performance. Such evaluation of work performance shall be made on an objective
and equitable basis. If the department head fails to complete the performance
evaluation in a timely manner, the employee's step increase shall be processed
on the eligibility date of the step increase.

schedule for non-affiliated employees by mutual agreement between the city and
the bargaining unit.

   (B)   It is the purpose and intent of this section to assure an employee of

   (C)   Any employee who is called in one hour or less prior to the start of
his normal shift shall receive such time at the overtime rate, but is excluded
from the three-hour minimum guarantee outlined in division (B) of this section.

a time earlier than the regular time without extra compensation under the call-
back provisions of this section, provided such change in schedule is made prior
to the completion of the shift the preceding day.

on Friday to the beginning of the next normal work shift the following Monday
or the 24 hour period of a holiday) at the rate of $20.00 per day.

continuous in character for at least one work day for FLSA non-exempt employees
and one work week for FLSA exempt employees. An employee may be temporarily
assigned to the work of any position of the same or lower class grade without
change in pay. In those cases when an FLSA non-exempt employee is assigned to
temporarily serve in a higher level FLSA exempt position, such as a
superintendent's position in the Highway Department, then such FLSA non-exempt
employees shall be granted the higher rate of pay in accordance with this
section if the assignment is for one full work day or longer.
   (B)   When a department head position is vacant, the Mayor, or Board as
appropriate, may appoint an individual as the acting department head. Such

§ 33.064 EMPLOYEES INJURED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
   (A)   Any employee of the city who sustains an injury which is compensable
under the Workers Compensation Law and who is entitled to receive compensation
benefits either by agreement of award shall, in addition to workers
compensation benefits, receive supplemental pay benefits from the city so that
combined worker compensation, wages, and supplemental pay benefits shall equal
80% of regular gross salary if the employee is covered under Social Security,
and 87% if the employee is not covered under Social Security. Regular gross
salary means gross wages as shown in the salary and wage schedules in the city
and the school department compensation plans. The Human Resources Department
shall make such adjustments as are necessary to ensure that employees will
actually receive the supplemental pay benefit provided above.
   (B)   Pending determination of workers compensation eligibility, the
employee may receive sick leave benefits. On a determination that the employee
is eligible for workers compensation benefits, the employee shall repay to the
city all sick leave benefits the employee has received. Upon repayment sick
leave credit shall be restored.
   (C)   To the extent authorized by law, the city, during the period the
employee is receiving supplemental pay benefits, shall continue to contribute
to the employee's retirement system on the employees' regular gross salary
provided the employee maintains his contributions to the system.
   (D)   Disabled employees may authorize deductions first from this
supplemental portion of his pay and then from his workers compensation
disability payments for medical insurance, credit union payments, bonds or
savings plans, retirement, and United Fund contributions, or other authorized
deductions, upon approved forms.
   (E)   In cases of third party liability the city shall be entitled to the
same lien and rights with respect to supplemental pay as are afforded employers
under the Workers Compensation Law. As a condition to receiving supplemental
pay benefits, the employee shall execute a written assignment of such lien and
rights to the city in such form as is required by the Risk Manager. The Risk
Manager is authorized to make third party lien settlements on behalf of the
city and the employee with respect to supplemental pay benefits, provided
however, that a full report shall be made to the Aldermanic Human Resources/
Insurance Committee.
   (F)   It shall be the duty of each department head to monitor the payment of
supplemental pay benefits to employees within his department. On recommendation
of the department head, the Risk Manager may require employees receiving
supplemental pay benefits to be examined by a physician or physician chosen by
the city at the city's expense at intervals not more frequent than the
requirements set forth in R.S.A. 281-A:38.
   (G)   In no event shall this section provide more than 52 weeks of
supplemental pay benefits for the injury or any recurrence thereof. Employees
unable to resume normal work duties after one year shall be examined by a
physician or physicians chosen by the city at the city's expense. If on such
examination the employee is found to be unable to fulfill the requirements of
his/her normal work duties, such employee shall be terminated.
   (H)   Any employee so terminated shall be entitled to a hearing before the
Aldermanic Human Resources/Insurance Committee. Requests by employees for a
hearing must be submitted to the Committee no later than 15 calendar days after
the receipt of notification of termination. The Aldermanic Human Resources/
Insurance Committee shall hold a hearing within 30 calendar days of the receipt
of the request.
   (I)   If the employee prevails in the hearing before the Aldermanic Human
Resources/ Insurance Committee, employment will not be terminated but in no
event shall the supplemental pay benefits exceed the maximum of 52 weeks of
cumulative benefits. The determination of the Aldermanic Human Resources/
Insurance Committee is subject to review by that Committee each 30 calendar
days. The decision of the Aldermanic Human Resources/Insurance Committee shall
be final.

§ 39.01 PURPOSE
   (A)   The procurement code shall promote fair and equitable treatment to all
suppliers or prospective suppliers of goods and services, promote effective
competition among prospective suppliers of goods and services, make as uniform
as possible the procedures among various departments and agencies of the city
by the standardization of the procurement process, to prevent abuses and
favoritism, and promote the economical, effective, and efficient use of the
city's total resources.
   (B)   The purpose of the procurement code is to provide to the purchasing
agency flexibility and defined guidelines for the purchasing of goods and
services. These guidelines define maximum allowed procurement limits. The
purchasing agency has the flexibility to reduce these limits in order to insure
that the best interest of the city is being served. Any questions relating to
this procurement code should be addressed in writingto the City Solicitor and/
or the Finance Officer. The purchasing agency will at all times retain adequate
records, based on the size of the procurement, as to the type of procurement
utilized and the basis of award.

or contract committing future unappropriated funds or a contract without a set
maximum yearly adjustment must be approved by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.
Multi year contracts that have been totally funded do not have to conform to
this section.
      (3)   The Airport Director or his or her designee is authorized by the
Board of Mayor and Aldermen to enter into multi-year agreements which do not
conform to this section when, in the opinion of the Airport Director,

request for proposals, after the time and date set in the solicitation
documents. Late bids or proposals shall be rejected.
   (G)   Mistakes in bids. A bidder may correct mistakes discovered before the
time and date set for the opening of bids based on procedures in the

   (M)   Prequalification. The purchasing agency may require prequalification
of prospective bidders for the procurement of supplies, materials, services and
construction if the procurement is less than $250,000. If the procurement is
over $250,000 the purchasing agency shall conform to §
39.08 of this procurement code. Bidders have a continuing duty to provide the
purchasing agency director with information on any material changes affecting
the basis of prequalification.
   (N)   Bid or performance bonds. The purchasing agency may require the use of
bid or performance bonds or other securities for the procurement of supplies,
materials, services or for construction, in order to guarantee satisfactory
completion of the procurement. However, any procurements over $150,000 shall
require a bid and performance bond or other security satisfactory to the
Purchasing Agency after consulting with the Finance Officer and the City
Solicitor. Bonds required by statute will not be waived. Any such bonding or
security requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Failure of the
bidder to comply with the security requirements in the solicitation may result
in the rejection of the bid or proposal.

of business of a contractor or any subcontractor that is related to the
performance of any contract awarded or to be awarded by the city.

order or contract must be available in the appropriate budget of the purchasing
agency prior to award of any purchase order or contract. Purchase orders and
contracts are subject to the annual appropriation of funds. Multi-term purchase
orders or contracts shall have adequate unencumbered funds available for the
first year except as noted.
(Ord. passed 5-3-05)
§ 39.07 SOURCE SELECTION.
   (A)   Small purchases. Small purchases are considered informal procurement
actions. Procurement requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to
constitute a small purchase.
      (1)   Total price is $10,000 or less, it shall be made after adequate
inquiry based on the director or his or her designee's knowledge of a
reasonable price and satisfactory quality.
      (2)   Total price more than $10,000 to $25,000. When the total price is
greater than $10,000, and not more than $25,000 purchases shall be made using
documented oral or written price or rate quotations from an adequate number of
suppliers. If available, a minimum of three quotations from qualified suppliers
shall be obtained. Such price and rate quotations, the date of such quotations
and the names of suppliers shall be documented.
   (B)   Competitive sealed bidding. Competitive sealed bidding is considered a
formal procurement action. Except as provided in this procurement code, all
purchases in excess of $25,000 shall be made by competitive sealed bidding.
Purchase orders and contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder
except as provided for in this code. Competitive sealed bidding procedures
shall at a minimum, incorporate the following:
      (1)   Formal bid specifications that at a minimum include the general
terms and conditions of the proposed purchase, requirements of the bidder, form
of contract, the forms for submission of bids and the basis of award.
      (2)   Product or service specifications that accurately describe the
product or service required in such a manner as to not preclude competition. If
specific manufacturer's names or models are used to describe the product or
service, a minimum of two manufacturers' names should be used if available.
There shall be a provision for approval of an equal product or service. Also,
see §
39.10(5).
      (3)   Adequate public notice of a minimum of five business days, prior to
the date established for the opening of bids. At a minimum, public notice shall
consist of:
         (a)   Notifying electronically, or otherwise, vendors registered on
the city’s bid list (email notification list); and
         (b)   Posting all competitive solicitations on the city’s website;
         City department personnel shall have the option of notifying selected
commercial subscription services, “Bid Houses,” of all relevant competitive
bids or publishing selected competitive solicitations in the local newspaper.
      (4)   Sealed bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place
designated in the invitation for bids. A tabulation of all bids received shall
be available for public inspection within a reasonable period of time.
Departments shall determine an adequate amount of time.
      (5)   The purchasing agency may negotiate with the two low bidders in
order to reduce the bid to fall within available funds and/or to obtain a lower
bid amount, provided that the original intent of the procurement is not
materially changed. The right to negotiate a lower total bid must be a
condition of the bidding documents.
      (6)   The award of bids shall be formalized through the execution of a
purchase order or written contractual agreement.
      (7)   The purchasing agency may reject any or all bids or parts thereof
when such rejection has been determined to be in the city's best interest.
   (C)   Multi-step sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to
readily prepare a detailed specification to support an award based on price, a
two-step bid process may be used. The first step is a request for proposals,
based on a general or performance specification, requesting the submission of
unpriced technical proposals. The second step is an invitation for firm and
final priced bids to those bidders whose proposals have been determined to be
technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first step.
       (1)   The multi-step sealed bidding method may be used if the purchasing
agency determines that:
         (a)   Available specifications or purchase descriptions are not
sufficiently complete to permit full competition without technical evaluations
and discussions to ensure mutual understanding between each bidder and the
city.
         (b)   Definite criteria exist for evaluation of technical offers.
         (c)   More than one technically qualified source is expected to be
available.
         (d)   A fixed price contract will be used.
      (2)   The invitation to bid must provide notice that a multi-step process
is being used. The notice should explain the multi-step process and that only
those bidders providing technically acceptable proposals, will be allowed to
participate in submitting a fine and final bid price.
      (3)   Adequate public notice of a minimum of ten working days prior to
the date established for the opening of bids shall be provided. Such notice
shall include as a minimum publication in a newspaper of general circulation.
      (4)   Award shall be made to the lowest dollar responsible bidder.
   (D)   Competitive sealed proposals.
      (1)   When competitive sealed bidding is not practical or advantageous to
the city, the purchasing agency director, may authorize the use of competitive
sealed proposals and negotiations as the procurement method.
      (2)   In determining whether competitive sealed bidding is practical or
advantageous to the city, the purchasing agency director, shall consider the
following factors:
         (a)   Whether the cost to develop formal technical bid specifications
sufficient to insure open competitive bids, would make the total cost of the
procurement excessive.
         (b)   Whether the proposed purchase is to be accompanied by land,
development, or other related economic transactions, therefore the bid price
may not accurately reflect the total economic effect of the purchase.
         (c)   Whether the product or service is specialized or custom
produced, and the development of terms, conditions, specifications, and other
provisions specifically defining the procurement requires interaction with
prospective suppliers.
         (d)   Where no responsible bidder has submitted a bid in response to
the invitation.
      (3)   If the purchasing agency director determines that competitive
sealed bidding is not practical and that competitive sealed proposals and
negotiations should be used, the purchasing agency shall:
         (a)   Develop terms, conditions and general or performance
specifications for the product or service required.
         (b)   In such cases where the award is not necessarily to be based on
the lowest negotiated price, the request for proposals shall indicate and
define the relative importance of price and other significant evaluation
factors.
         (c)   Provide adequate public notice as in the case of competitive
sealed bids.
         (d)   Sealed proposals shall be received at the time and place
designated in request for proposals. A proposal received after the closing date
and time set for the receipt of proposals, is late and shall not be considered.
No proposals shall be handled so as to permit disclosure of the contents of any
proposal to competing offerers during the process of negotiation. Submission of
the proposal shall be conditioned on not disclosing the proposals content until
the completion of negotiations and award of a contract. Proposals shall be
opened in the presence of witnesses. Proposals and modifications shall be shown
only to city personnel having a legitimate interest in them or persons
assisting in the city evaluation.
      (4)   After the opening and evaluation of competitive sealed proposals,
written or verbal negotiations may be conducted with one or more parties who
have submitted proposals. Such negotiations are designed to achieve terms and
conditions most favorable to the city. Negotiations need not be conducted where
time constraints preclude additional negotiations or where the purchasing
agency certifies that acceptance of an initial offer without discussion, would
result in fair and equitable prices. The request for proposals shall clearly
define the city's rights pertaining to negotiations.
      (5)   Award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal has been
determined to be responsive and most advantageous to the city. The contract
file shall contain, in writing, the basis on which award is made.
(Ord. passed 5-3-05; Am. Ord. passed 12-6-11)
§ 39.08 PREQUALIFICATION OF BIDDERS.
   (A)   Prequalification of potential bidders shall be accomplished for all
contracts for construction, reconstruction, alteration and repair or
refurbishing of real property with an estimated project cost in excess of
$250,000. Prequalification of contractors based on the type of work and dollar
limits may be done annually. The invitations for bids shall be issued only to
firms that have, in the city's sole determination, been prequalified.
   (B)   The purchasing agency involved shall establish rules and regulations
that govern prequalification of bidders. The rules and regulations shall take
into consideration:
      (1)   The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform the
contractor provide the service required.
      (2)   Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service
promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference.
      (3)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder.
      (4)   The quality of performance on previous contracts.
      (5)   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and
ordinances relating to the contract.
      (6)   The sufficiency of financial resources and ability of the bidder to
perform the contract.
      (7)   The quality, availability, and adaptability of the supplies or
contractual services to the particular use required.
      (8)   The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service.
      (9)   The number and scope of bidder conditions attached to the bid.
      (10)   The amount of total direct and indirect costs that would be
incurred by the city because of the bid.
      (11)   The ability of the bidder to meet the city's bonding and insurance
requirements.
   (C)   These rules and regulations may also include other special
considerations as authorized by law.

§ 39.09 PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
   The procurement of accounting, architectural, auditing, engineering,
financial, legal, data processing, medical services and independent consultant
services for personnel, insurance and actuarial planning and management, human
resource and public relations, may be accomplished using the following
procedures:
   (A)   Professional services $25,000 or less. The purchasing agency may
solicit one or more proposals for the procurement of professional services at a
fee which is deemed fair and reasonable. The purchasing agency will document
the basis of the procurement in the project file. In no case shall more than
three awards be made to the same vendor in any 12 months without the prior
written notification to the Finance Officer.
   (B)   Professional services greater than $25,000. A formal request for
proposal process shall be used. The purchasing agency shall develop a request
for proposals to include terms, conditions, scope of service, desired results,
end product and consultant qualification. Selection criteria and the method of
determining a final fee by the city will be included in the request for
proposals. This process can be accomplished in a request for qualification
phase and a request for proposals phase. The request for proposal process shall
include the following:
      (1)   Adequate public notice of a minimum of ten business days prior to
the date established for the receipt of qualifications and/or proposals shall
be provided. Such notice shall include as a minimum, publication in a newspaper
of general circulation.
      (2)   A minimum of three proposals, if available, shall be evaluated and
selection made based on demonstrated competence, qualifications and project
approach for the services required. Where applicable to a particular project,
factors such as the following shall be used in tentatively selecting a firm:
         (a)   Specific experience with similar projects.
         (b)   Specific experience with earlier phases of the same project.
         (c)   Background and experience of staff members who would be assigned
to the job.
         (d)   Availability.
         (e)   Locality of firm.
         (f)   Ability to communicate ideas.
         (g)   Ability to supply all of the major disciplines necessary to

best overall proposal. The criteria may incorporate a weighting system for the
proposals received.
      (5)   Fees for professional services are an important consideration,
which must not be taken lightly. However, selection shall be ultimately based
on demonstrated competence, qualifications and project approach at a reasonable
fee. Depending on the complexity of the project, the purchasing agency may
utilize one of the following procedures to determine a fee:
         (a)   The fee can be requested as part of the requested proposal and
considered in imitatively selecting a firm.

(Ord. passed 5-3-05)
§ 39.13 SPECIAL PROCUREMENT METHODS.
   The purchasing agency proposing to utilize this section of the procurement
code must detail in the project file why utilizing this section of the code is
in the best interest of the city.
   (A)   Procurement methods.
      (1)   Design-build is a project delivery method in which the procuring
agency enters into a single contract for design and construction of an
infrastructure facility. Procurement of design-build services shall generally
follow procedures outlined in the "Design Build Manual of Practice", as
published by the "Design Build Institute of America".
      (2)   Design-bid-build means a project delivery method in which the
purchasing agency sequentially awards separate contracts, the first for
Architectural and Engineering Services to design the project and the second for
construction of the project according to the design.
      (3)   Operation and maintenance is a project delivery method whereby the
procuring agency enters into a single contract for the routine operation,
routine repair, and routine maintenance of an infrastructure facility.
Operation and Maintenance services shall be procured from prequalified
contractors by utilizing competitive scaled proposals submitted in response to
a request for proposals, which has established the supplies and services
required to maintain and operate infrastructure facilities.
      (4)   Design-build-operate-maintain is a project delivery method in which
the procuring agency enters into a single contract for design, construction,
maintenance, and operation of an infrastructure facility over a contractually
defined period. All or a portion of the funds required to pay for the services
provided by the contractor during the contract period are either appropriated
by the city prior to award of the contract or secured by the city through fee
or user charges. Procurement of design-build-operate-maintain services shall
generally follow procedures outlined in the "Design Build Manual of Practice",
as published by the "Design Build Institute of America".
      (5)   Design-build-finance-operate is a project delivery method in which
the procuring agency enters into a single contract for design, construction,
finance, maintenance, and operation of an infrastructure facility over a
contractually defined period. No funds are appropriated to pay for any part of
the services provided by the contractor during the contract period. Procurement
of design-build-finance-operate- maintain services shall generally follow
procedures outlined in the "Design Build Manual of Practice", as published by
the "Design Build Institute of America". A preliminary determination by the
City should have been made that project revenues are sufficient, over the
length of the proposed contract, to cover design, construction, finance, and
operations.
      (6)   Design-build-finance-operate-maintain means a project delivery
method in which the purchasing agency enters into a single contract for design,
construction, finance, maintenance, and operation of an infrastructure facility
over a contractually defined period. No city funds are appropriated to pay for
any part of the services provided by the contractor during the contract period.
This deliver method does not preclude the city from providing financing as long
as the city ultimately is reimbursed all of its costs over the life of the
contract agreement.
      (7)   Construction management services is a project delivery process by
which a qualified third party provides construction leadership with a defined
scope throughout various phases of the project (e.g. planning, design and
construction). The Construction Manager would typically provide advice and the
construction leadership, contract management, direction, supervision,
coordination and control of the work during the construction phase. The
Construction Manager would strive to integrate the expertise of the design
professional with the contractors knowledge of project constructability in
order to obtain a cost effective end result. The Construction Manager could
hold the dual role of design professional and contractor. The procurement of
Construction Management Services shall generally follow procedures outlined by
the Association of General Contractors "Owners Guidelines for Selection of a
Construction Manager".
      (8)   Other special project delivery methods or combinations of the above
may be utilized provided that the purchasing agency can demonstrate that the
delivery method meets the intent of this procurement code and receives the
approval of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.
   (B)   Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state all
evaluation factors and subfactors that will be separately rated and the weights
to be given to each factor and subfactor in the evaluation. Evaluation factors
may consist of the following:
      (1)   Demonstrated compliance with design requirements;
      (2)   Qualifications and experience;
      (3)   Financial capacity;
      (4)   Project schedule;
      (5)   Price (or life-cycle price for design-build-operate-maintain and
design-build-finance-operate-maintain procurements); and
      (6)   Other evaluation factors if any.
   (C)   The request for proposals may require each offerer to identify an
Independent Design Peer Reviewer whose competence and qualifications to provide
such services shall be an additional evaluation factor in the award of the
contract. The city reserves the right to choose its own Independent Design Peer
Reviewer.
(Ord. passed 5-3-05)
§ 39.14 PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   Conflict of interest. No employee, officer or agent of the city shall
participate in the award or administration of a contract in which they or any
member of their immediate family has an interest. No employee, officer or agent
shall participate in the award or administration of a contract with any person,
firm, partnership or corporation in which they or any member of their immediate

participating or is about to participate in the award or administration of a
contract, shall either solicit or accept any kickback, gratuity, contingent

commercial interest, travel, offer of employment or anything else, the primary
significance of which is economic gain.
   (C)   Standards of conduct. Every employee, officer or agent of the city is
expressly prohibited from knowingly participating in the following:

§ 52.062 NOTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the Public Works Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director,
and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the
POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user:
      (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes.
      (2)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestream discharged during the calendar month.
      (3)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
   (B)   All notification must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed conditions must be submitted under
§ 52.058 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of
§§ 52.054 and
52.061.
   (C)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (D)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Public
Works Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (E)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume of toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (F)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued

accordance with conditions established by the Environmental Protection Division
of the Highway Department. Such application shall be on forms provided by EPD.
Usage charges for residential customers installing a deduct meter will be
computed based on the number of cubic feet of water consumed on the premises as
metered by the waterworks minus the number of cubic feet of water as measured
by the deduct meter at the effective rates of division (C) of this section.
      (2)   Failure to comply with all conditions or any attempt to defraud the
billing system, as determined by EPD, will result in revocation of the right to
use the deduct meter and in such case billing calculations will revert to the
terms described in division (C). In such case, penalties will be sought in
accordance with all applicable ordinances.
   (E)   User charge credits for non-residential customers are available by
making application to the Highway Department, Environmental Protection Division
(EPD) for a deduct meter as stipulated in (D)(1) and (2) above and in

non-residential users will be given for water used for irrigation purposes
only. All other provisions of §
52.160 will apply.
   (F)   User charge credits for elderly residential accounts will be given to
those sewer accounts that are granted an elderly property tax exemption by the
Tax Assessor’s Office. Property owners qualifying for the tax exemption will be
billed at the rate of 50% of the current sewer usage charge and 50% of the
current sewer service charge. This credit will not apply to condominium
associations or homeowners associations. The sewer usage and sewer service
charge will revert back to standard rates outlined in §
52.160 once the qualifying owner no longer resides at the property or upon
notification from the Tax Assessor’s Office that the property has been removed
from the Tax Assessor’s Tax Exemption Program. All other provisions of § 52
52.160 shall apply.

§ 70.55 RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING.
   (A)   Findings and purposes. The Board of Mayor and Aldermen hereby finds
and declares that the provisions of this section are enacted for the following
reasons:
      (1)   To reduce hazardous traffic conditions resulting from the use of
streets within residential districts for vehicles parked by persons not
residing within the residential districts;
      (2)   To protect these residential districts from polluted air, excess
noise, and refuse caused by the entry of such vehicles;

unreasonable burdens in gaining access to their residences;
      (4)   To preserve the character of those districts as residential
districts;
      (5)   To encourage the use of public transportation;
      (6)   To promote efficiency in the maintenance of streets in these
residential districts in a clean and safe condition;
      (7)   To preserve the value of the property in these residential
districts;
      (8)   To promote traffic safety and safety of children and other
pedestrians in these residential districts;
      (9)   To forestall dangers arising from the blocking of fire lanes,
hydrants and other facilities required by emergency vehicles, both in reaching

      (10)   To facilitate the movement of traffic in the event of accidents
and other disasters; and
      (11)   To promote the peace, comfort, convenience, and welfare of all
inhabitants of the city.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms,
phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 94.40 NOISE VARIANCE BOARD.
   (A)   It is recognized that in initiating community noise limits, any number
of unanticipated situations may occur. Although the city is primarily concerned
with protecting, preserving and promoting the health, safety, welfare and peace
and quiet of the citizens of Manchester, the city realizes that there may be
preexisting conditions that need an extended period of time to conform to the
noise limits imposed by this chapter. The city also recognizes that events or
incidents can occur where there was every good faith expectation of complying
with the noise limits imposed by this chapter, but for some unforeseen
circumstance, those events or incidents failed to comply.
   (B)   This section hereby establishes a Noise Variance Board in which
members shall approve or deny variances to this chapter, hereinafter referred
to as a noise variance. The Board shall consist of the Committee on
Administration of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.

detrimental impact of noise upon the community. The guidelines are as follows:
   (A)   Variances shall be granted prior to or in anticipation of an event.
   (B)   The city reserves the right to grant a variance after the fact if it
is deemed by the Noise Variance Board to be in the public good, if the Board
believes that an honest, fair and reasonable attempt was made to comply with
the noise limits imposed by this chapter, or the failure to comply was due to
some unforeseen circumstance.
   (C)   A variance for the continuation of a non-complying activity may be
granted after a reasonable attempt was made to comply and may contain such
stipulations as the Board may deem necessary to protect the public that may
include, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Regulation of times;
      (2)   The erection of noise barriers, shielding or other noise abatement;
and
      (3)   A demonstration of compliance progress.
   (D)   The applicant bears the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to
allow the Noise Variance Board to reach conclusions and make findings to
support the authorization of a variance.
   (E)   The Board may require a public hearing on a certain matter to permit
abutting landowners to present written or oral testimony for consideration of
granting or denying a variance.
   (F)   The Board may request review and recommendations from various city
departments including the Public Health Director, Director of Planning and
Community Development, Chief of Police, City Clerk or their designees.
Testimony of department representatives may be requested at a variance hearing.
   (G)   Final decisions shall be made available within 72 hours after a vote
on an application. A written decision will be mailed to the applicant with
copies made available to the Departments of Health, Police and City Clerk.
   (H)   In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions or
stipulations as it deems necessary and proper in order to preserve the intent
of this chapter.
   (I)   All decisions by the Noise Variance Board are final and may not be
appealed to any other municipal board, committee or commission.
   (J)   As community noise is a public health concern, noise variances shall
only be granted for a reasonable period of time, not more than two years.
   (K)   The renewal of a variance after two years requires the consent of the
Board of Mayor and Aldermen.
   (L)   Variances shall not be granted for continued or sustained violations
that may be physically injurious to one or more persons as determined by the
Public Health Director.
   (M)   Once an application has been denied by the Noise Variance Board, the

or sale of any article enumerated in §
110.01 of this title, shall prepare transaction records electronically as
directed by the Chief of Police or his designee, and submit said form
electronically, detailing the proven identity of the seller including his name,
date of birth, address, type of identification and identification number if
there is one. A digital photo of said person shall accompany the electronic
filing of the transaction. Only government issued forms of identification will
be accepted. No transaction shall occur if the identity of the seller cannot be
proven. The record of the transaction shall also contain the month, day, and
year when the transaction occurred as well as a full, accurate, and detailed
description of each article purchased including brand name and serial number,
if any, with the price paid therefor, and cause the record to be signed by the
seller in person along with a digital color photo of the property pursuant to
the following requirements:
      (1)   Individually identifiable articles. Articles that are individually
identifiable by a serial number or other applied numbers, letters, characters
or markings or other unique features that serve to distinguish it from any
other similar article and can be used to establish ownership.
         (a)   Each individually identifiable article brought in to a
pawnbroker or secondhand dealer for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during
a single transaction shall be itemized separately. Articles shall not be
grouped together (i.e., five gold monogrammed rings), but must provide a
complete and thorough description of each item to include the following:
            1.   Type of article;
            2.   Brand name/make/manufacturer (if applicable);
            3.   Model number (if applicable);

identifiable article, sufficiently detailed to allow reasonable identification
of the article. The digital photograph(s) shall capture any identifying
numbers, marks, writing, engraving, etc., or any other distinguishing

pawnbroker or secondhand dealer for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during
a single transaction may be grouped and shall include reasonable descriptions
of the number and types of items within each group to enable the Police
Department to determine if they may have been stolen during a particular crime.
(For example, the licensee receives a video game controller, five video game
discs, and numerous items of jewelry. The licensee would have to individually
itemize and photograph the video game controller as outlined in division (A)(1)
above, as it would be a serially-numbered item. The remaining items shall not
be listed as “miscellaneous video games and jewelry.” Instead, the licensee
shall describe them as follows: “five video game discs to include the following
titles...” and “miscellaneous jewelry to include two yellow gold necklaces, one
silver necklace, two pairs of silver earrings, one women’s yellow gold ring,
one women’s white gold diamond ring and two silver bracelets.”)
         (b)   A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each group of similar
types of articles within the same transaction. The articles may be photographed
together as a group but each individual article shall be visible in the
photograph. (For example, given the circumstances outlined in division (A)(2)
(a) above, the five video game discs would be photographed together as a group,
side-by-side, and the jewelry items would be photographed together as a group
with each item laid out so as to be individually viewable.)
   (B)   When filed electronically, a copy of the record shall be forwarded to
the Police Department or authorized data storage site as soon as possible, but
no later than 24 hours after completion of the transaction. The dealer shall
retain a copy of the record at his local place of business for one year from
the date of transaction which, along with any article therein listed, may be
inspected by any duly authorized police officer. No article so purchased shall
be sold, changed, altered in its appearance or otherwise within 30 days after
the purchase thereof, except with the written consent of the Chief of Police or
his designee. All items purchased or pawned shall remain on the premises during
the waiting period. Every pawnshop, or secondhand dealer, auctioneer, or
auction house, upon file sale of a secondhand article enumerated in §
110.01 of this title, shall prepare and maintain at his local place of
business, a record of the sale detailing the proven identity of the buyer
including his name, date of birth, address, and type of identification. The
record shall also contain a description of the article sold including brand
name and serial number, if any, and the price paid therefor. The record shall
be available at the local place of business for inspection by any duly
authorized police officer for one year from the date of transaction.
   (C)   Every junk dealer, upon the acquisition of any item enumerated in §
110.01 of this title, shall prepare transaction records electronically as
directed by the Chief of Police or his designee. When filed electronically, a

identity of the seller including his name, date of birth, address, type of
identification, and identification number if there is one. Only government
issued forms of identification will be accepted. If the identity of the seller
cannot be proven, no transaction may occur. Furthermore, a digital photo of
said person shall accompany the electronic filing of the transaction. The
owner, corporation, or company shall maintain at his local place of business, a
record of such transaction detailing the proven identity of the seller. The
record shall also include a full, accurate, and detailed description of the
item, including brand name and serial number, if any, along with a color
digital photo of item(s) pursuant to the following photographing requirements:

DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY
§ 118.20 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the policy of the city that its licensed drivers of taxicabs
(hereinafter, the licensees) be free of substance abuse. The abuse of alcohol
or the use of illegal drugs reduces awareness and increases the potential for
accidents. Substance abuse thereby increases both the risk of injury to fares
and citizens of the city and the risk of damage to public and private property.
   (B)   It is the policy of the city that the use or possession of alcoholic
beverages or illegal drugs by taxicab licensees while on duty is prohibited.
Licensees shall not report for duty under the influence of alcoholic beverages
or with sufficient amounts of illegal drugs in their system so as to give rise
to a positive drug test or impair their job performance. For purposes of this
policy, the term ILLEGAL DRUG means any intoxicant, any narcotic, marijuana, or
any controlled drug, save medication prescribed for a licensee by a licensed
physician, presuming the use of such is consistent with the prescription and
with the operation of a motor vehicle. Violations of this policy shall result
in disciplinary action, including immediate suspension of the vehicle license.
(Ord. passed 4-7-98)
§ 118.21 PROHIBITED CONDUCT.
   A licensee is expected to report for duty in an appropriate mental and
physical condition for work. Accordingly, a licensee shall not:
   (A)   Work or report to work under the influence of alcohol or illegal
drugs. A licensee shall be deemed under the influence of alcohol if he/she has
an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or more or is impaired to any degree as a

Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (hereinafter, SAMSHA)
standards. The applicant shall complete the test at a time and place specified
by the office of the City Clerk.
   (B)   Random. The city also conducts random drug and alcohol testing. All
licensees will be included in a random selection system. The random selection
system shall provide an equal chance for each licensee to be selected for each
random test. Accordingly, a particular licensee may be selected for successive
tests or may not be selected at all during the licensing year. Random tests
shall be reasonably spread throughout the year. The city shall annually test a
minimum of 50% of its licensees for drugs and a minimum of 25% of its licensees
for alcohol. Upon notification of selection, a licensee shall complete the test
at a time and place specified by the office of the City Clerk. The test shall
be conducted by a local physician, lab or hospital in accordance with SAMSHA
standards. All random drug and alcohol tests shall be paid for by the city;
however, any other costs associated with a second analysis of the licensee’s
specimen, counseling, treatment, rehabilitation or other medical follow-up
shall be paid for by the licensee.

forth herein shall be deemed unsuitable for licensure. Any licensee who tests
positive for any of the substances set forth herein shall be deemed unsuitable
for continued licensure and shall be subject to the provisions of

§ 118.24 REFUSAL TO TEST.
   Any person licensed to drive a taxicab by the city shall be deemed to have
given consent to the drug and alcohol tests employed by the city under this
chapter. Accordingly, refusal to submit to any drug and alcohol test
established herein shall be grounds to suspend a license. Any conduct intended
to obstruct or unreasonably delay the proper administration of a test shall be
deemed a refusal to submit to the test. In the event that a licensee cannot
provide a sufficient urine or breath specimen, the city may direct the
individual to a physician for purposes of evaluation. If the physician cannot
find a legitimate medical explanation for the licensee’s inability to provide a
sufficient urine or breath specimen, the licensee shall be deemed to have
refused to submit to the test.

evaluated by the SAP, submit to any treatment the SAP prescribes, and
successfully complete a return to duty and/or alcohol test. The licensee shall
also be subject to follow-up testing. Follow-up testing is separate from and in
addition to any pre-licensing or random testing procedures. The schedule for
follow-up testing shall be unannounced and in accordance with instructions of
the SAP. Follow-up testing may continue for a period of up to 12 months
following the licensee’s return to duty. Follow-up testing shall consist of no
fewer than six tests. The cost of any SAP evaluation, prescribed treatment,
return to duty and follow-up testing shall be paid by the licensee.

affect the authority of the Committee on Administration to prescribe the period
of suspension or revocation it deems appropriate under
§ 118.16.

Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.26 LABORATORY PROCEDURES; RETEST.

laboratory certified by SAMSHA. All specimens initially testing positive will
be confirmed by a subsequent confirmation test before the laboratory reports a
result as positive. The laboratory shall report all positive laboratory test
results to the Medical Review Officer. The licensee or applicant shall also be
notified of any positive laboratory test results and have an opportunity to
explain to the Medical Review Officer such result. In the event the Medical
Review Officer determines there is no legitimate basis for the licensee’s
objection, the test will stand as reported. In the event the Medical Review
Officer determines there is an explanation for the positive test result other
than the use or abuse of illegal drugs or alcohol, the test result shall be
reported back as negative.
   (B)   A licensee or applicant whose test results are positive may, at his/
her own expense, request a retest of the original sample. Such a request shall
be made within 72 hours of the licensee or applicant being notified of the

The retest shall be performed by a SAMSHA certified lab. In the event the
retest demonstrates a negative result, the licensee will be reimbursed for the
cost of the retest.

height.
   (G)   Every owner of a taxicab which is temporarily removed from passenger
service shall clearly identify such vehicle as being “out of service” via an
exterior light, if so equipped, or by placing a placard in the vehicle's rear
window identifying the vehicle as being out of service. The placard shall be
placed in such a way so as to be visible from the rear but not so it is in
conflict with state motor vehicle regulations.

properly attached to the vehicle. The number of plates issued to a taxicab
company or a taxicab dispatch company shall not exceed the maximum number of
vehicles which are insured for passenger service under
§ 118.10(B)(5) of this chapter. Out-of-service vehicles shall be identified as

company may transfer the plate to another of its taxicab vehicles which are
licensed under
§ 118.15(A)(1) of this chapter as backup or replacement vehicles so that those
vehicles may be used in the transportation of passengers. The replacement fee
for any medallion is $15.00.

City Clerk dividing the driver's and passenger's seats. When installed in a
vehicle this partition shall be enclosed in an adequate frame and constructed
of material with a minimum thickness of one-half inch and of such other
specifications required by the Office of the City Clerk. The partition must be
stationary and may contain an appropriate opening, not more than six inches by
six inches, for the payment of fares. Partitions shall be constructed in such a
manner as to accommodate the official rate card (approximately five inches by
eight inches) and taxicab driver's license (four inches by six inches) which
shall be displayed in clear view of the passenger and secured from the driver's
side of the partition. The partition and attached rate card and driver's
license shall not obstruct the driver's rear vision or the passenger's view of
the taximeter. The official rate card and taxicab driver’s license shall be
prominently displayed at all times and in full view of any passengers in
vehicles with or without an installed protective partition.

license and medallion, until the circumstances which led to the confiscation
are corrected.

   (B)   The Police Department is hereby authorized to seize or immobilize any

operating without a valid TNC or transportation network driver license. Upon

the vehicle of such seizure, the reason therefore, and of the place to which
such vehicle has been removed or immobilized. The Police Department shall order
the holding of any such vehicle for a period of not less than ten days from the
date of the required notification to the owner. During this period the owner
may redeem any such vehicle by correcting the violation of this chapter which
led to such seizure or by providing satisfactory evidence of his ability or

services which is impounded or immobilized and which is not redeemed within 30
days of the date of notification as described in this section shall become the
property of the city. Cost for towing and storage charges will be billed to the
owner of the vehicle seized and must be paid before the release of the vehicle

off the road and confiscate and hold the vehicle license, until the
circumstances which led to the confiscation are collected.

§ 130.10 [RESERVED].
   (Previous section repealed 7-20-04)
§ 130.11 NUDITY IN PLACES SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is declared to be the purpose and intent of
this section to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals of the
community, to promote the stability of property values, and impose restrictions
upon those activities which pander to gross sexuality in a manner that would
detract from the neighborhood, adversely affect the property values, increase
crime and violence, and be repugnant to the morals of the community. In
recognition of the protections afforded to citizens under the First and
Fourteenth Amendments, it is not the intent of this section to inhibit freedom
of speech or the press, but rather to deter those of low morals from imposing
their lack of morals upon the rest of the community; and further recognizing
that those parts of a community, which become centers of loose moral conduct,
frequently become places of rowdiness, criminality, and indecent behavior. It
is further the belief that just as advertising is designed to stimulate one's
appetite for desiring goods or a service, an over-abundance of preoccupation
with sexual displays or material arouses the appetites of those so preoccupied
and encourages violations of the criminal statutes involving sexual offenses
and is contrary to the health, safety and welfare of the community.
   (B)   Prohibition. No person shall appear in a state of nudity in any place
that sells or offers to sell alcoholic beverages within the city.
   (C)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
   NUDITY. The showing of the human male or female genitals, pubic area, or
buttocks with less than fully opaque covering, the showing of the female breast
with less than fully opaque covering or any part of the nipples, or the showing
of the male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.
(Ord. passed 12-3-96)
Penalty, see § 130.99 
§ 130.12 EXOTIC/UNUSUAL ENTERTAINMENT IN PLACES SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is declared to be the purpose and intent of
this section to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals of the
community, to promote the stability of property values, and impose restrictions
upon those activities which pander to gross sexuality in a manner that would
detract from the neighborhood, adversely affect the property values, increase
crime and violence, and be repugnant to the morals of the community. In
recognition of the protections afforded to citizens under the First and
Fourteenth Amendments, it is not the intent of this section to inhibit freedom
of speech or the press, but rather to deter those of low morals from imposing
their lack of morals upon the rest of the community; and further recognizing
that those parts of a community, which become centers of loose moral conduct,
frequently become places of rowdiness, criminality, and indecent behavior. It
is further the belief that, just as advertising is designed to stimulate one's
appetite for desiring goods or a service, an over-abundance of preoccupation
with sexual displays or material arouses the appetites of those so preoccupied
and encourages violations of the criminal statutes involving sexual offenses
and is contrary to the health, safety and welfare of the community.

public pursuant to a license issued by the New Hampshire Liquor Commission.

be used any of the streets, sidewalks, square or any other public place,
excepting parks as governed by Chapter 96, as a camping place absent prior
written permission from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen or its designee. As

SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS
§ 130.50 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It has been determined that certain businesses and/or individuals within the
city are possessing and selling certain substances which when ingested produce
intoxicating effects similar to Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or marijuana. These
substances, which are described herein, are often used as an alternative
synthetic to marijuana and are potentially dangerous to users, society, and the
long term effects are not yet known. The effects of these substances are a
health concern to the citizens of the city. Not all of the
substances are categorized as illegal controlled substances under state or
federal law. By selling these "legal" substances for smoking and ingestion
under the guise of incense, the manufacturers avoid the United Sates Food and
Drug Administration process for study and approval of such prior to
distribution for consumption. In addition, by marketing such "incense" products
directed at the controlled drug subculture the manufacturers and sellers avoid
the Schedule I implications of the Controlled Substances Act. The City of
Manchester Board of Mayor and Aldermen recognizes that there is no legitimate
purpose of such chemicals contained therein.

be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in violation of
§§ 154.11 or
154.13 hereof in any of the areas of land described in
§ 154.10 hereof, unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and
granted. Each such application shall indicate the purpose for which the permit
is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for
shall be granted.
   (B)   Existing uses. Before any existing use, structure, or tree may be
replaced, substantially altered, or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher,
or replanted, within any of the areas of land described in
§ 154.10 hereof, a permit must be secured authorizing such replacement, change
or repair if it is in violation of
§§ 154.11 or
154.13. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or
creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree
to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than
it was on the effective date of this chapter or than it is when the application
for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for a permit for
replacement, change or repair of existing use, structure, or tree shall be
granted.
('71 Code, Appendix A, § 8) (Ord. passed 6-4-57)

   Any permit or variance granted under
§§ 154.14 or

require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the present
owner or lessor at his own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon
such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence
of an airport hazard. ('71 Code, Appendix A, § 9) (Ord. passed 6-4-57)
§ 154.16 NONCONFORMING USES.
   The regulations prescribed in
§§ 154.11 and
154.13 of this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering,
or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require
any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure
and the construction or alteration, of which was begun prior to the effective
date of this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two
years thereof.
('71 Code, Appendix A, § 6) (Ord. passed 6-4-57)

   Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply for a
variance therefrom. Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application
of enforcement of these regulations would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public
interest but do substantial justice, and be in accordance with the spirit of
this chapter.
('71 Code, Appendix A, § 7) (Ord. passed 6-4-57)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this chapter
