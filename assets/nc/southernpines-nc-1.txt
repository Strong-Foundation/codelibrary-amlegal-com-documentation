Manager or his or her designee has granted a permit for the event. The Town may
grant the permit if it determines that the special event will not materially
endanger the public health and safety, will be in harmony with the area in
which it is located, and will not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the
flow of traffic or the rights of adjacent or surrounding property owners. The
permit may impose conditions limiting the hours and duration of the event,
preventing disruption of adjacent uses, and assuring, at no expense to the
Town, removal of litter caused by the event. If the applicant seeks to allow
the sale, distribution, possession, or consumption of any alcoholic beverages
at the event, the permit may be issued only when:

the beverages on public property is not for profit and has received any permit
required by the State of North Carolina;
      (3)   The alcoholic beverages are limited to malt beverages, fortified
wine, and unfortified wine; and
      (4)   The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee has reviewed the
application and determined that the proposed presence of malt beverages or
unfortified wine will not materially endanger public health or safety.
   (C)   The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee also may impose conditions
on the permit to ensure that the presence of alcoholic beverages will not
materially endanger public health or safety and may revoke the permit and
terminate the event if it is determined that the consumption of alcoholic
beverages endanger public health and safety.
   (D)   The permittee has obtained, in advance, any and all necessary permits,
licenses, and/or approvals from the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission and
remains in compliance with all local and state ABC laws.
   (E)   If the event includes alcohol sales only in the manufacturer’s
original, sealed container for consumption off premises, a Town permit may not
be required unless the event meets the other characteristics defined in
division (B).

PREQUALIFICATION OF CONTRACTORS
§ 34.01 APPLICATION OF POLICY.
   (A)   This policy on prequalification of contractors shall apply to a
project involving construction and/or repair only if:
      (1)   The Town will use one of the construction methods authorized by
G.S. § 143-128(a1)(1) through G.S. §143-128(a1)(3) and the Town Manager has
determined that based on the size, specialized nature or complexity of the work
to be done that it would be in the best interests of the Town for all
contractors to be prequalified; or
      (2)   The Town will enter into a contract with a construction manager at
risk pursuant to which the construction manager at risk is required to
prequalify first tier subcontractors pursuant to G.S. § 143-128.1(c) .
   (B)   The Town is not required to prequalify contractors for any particular
project or projects. For any contract to which this policy applies, bids
submitted by contractors who have not been prequalified will be deemed invalid
and nonresponsive and shall be rejected.

Town and, if applicable, the construction manager at risk, reserve the right to
reject a contractor's bid if it is determined that the contractor has not
submitted the lowest responsible and responsive bid. Prequalification shall not
preclude the Town or the construction manager at risk from concluding that the
contractor is not a responsible bidder pursuant to G.S. §143-129.

prequalification status solely on the basis that they have not previously been
awarded a contract by the Town; and
      (9)   The contractor's affirmation that they will seek out, solicit and
utilize when warranted and qualified historically underutilized businesses
(minority, female, veteran owned); and provide required documentation and

§ 50.012 SUSPENSION OF SERVICE WITHOUT NOTICE.
   In addition to any other reasons or conditions under which service may be
discontinued, service to any location may be discontinued for the following
reasons:
   (A)   To prevent fraud and abuse. Fraud and abuse shall include but not be

(1989 Code, § 50.12) (Ord. passed 3-13-1984; Am. Ord. 1586, passed 10-13-2015)
§ 50.013 COMPLAINTS; ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   It is the policy of the Town to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The Town's bills shall contain, in
addition to the title, address, room number, and telephone number of the
official in charge of billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions
to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill; and
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by the twenty-fifth of the month,
service will be discontinued for nonpayment; and
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the Town
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer's service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer's complaint. Requests
for waiver of payment will not be entertained; only questions of proper and
correct billing will be considered. In the absence of payment of the bill
rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided herein, service will be
discontinued at the time specified, above; and
      (2)   The Town official in charge of utility billing shall be authorized
to establish a payment plan for excessively large bills due to water lost to
known or unknown causes. The term of the repayment shall not exceed 6 months
and the monthly repayment amount shall not be less than the customer's normal
bill.
      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the Town to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge as listed in Appendix A of this chapter. All provisions of this
division, including the turn-on charge, shall apply to any past due bill not
paid by 5:00 p.m. of the last business day before the cut-off day.
   (B)   The Town will make special meter readings at the request of the
consumer for a fee as specified in the
appendix; provided, however, that if the special reading discloses that the
meter was over-read or if the meter has been malfunctioning the charge will be
refunded. The Town official in charge of utility billing may authorize special
meter readings for which no charge will be made.
   (C)   If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the Town's
representative or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for
any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his or
her previous bills and/or from other proper data.
   (D)   The Town official in charge of utility billing, when the bill is
either unpaid or was paid under protest and not resolved, may reduce the amount
of a bill for water lost to known or unknown causes as follows:
      (1)   Water charge adjustment.
         (a)   The base usage shall be determined by the average of the gallon
usages in the same billing period in the previous year and the billing periods
immediately before and after that billing period. If adequate history is not
available to determine the customer's base usage as indicated, the best
available information shall be used. To qualify for an adjustment the usage in
question must be at least 50% higher than this base usage. Multiply this base
usage by the applicable current water rate.
         (b)   Subtract the gallons obtained in division (D)(1)(a) of this
section from the actual usage of the period in question. Multiply the
difference by the volume charge rate as determined in the bulk water rate
calculations in the
Appendix for Rates, Fees and Charges set forth at the end of this chapter.
         (c)   Add the amount obtained in division (D)(1)(a) and (b) of this
section to the applicable minimum charge. This is the amount of the adjusted
bill for water.
      (2)   Sewer charge adjustment.
         (a)   The base usage and the usage amount to qualify for an adjustment
for sewer shall be the same as that determined as the base usage and the usage
amount to qualify for an adjustment for water in (D)(1)(a) above. Multiply this
base usage by the applicable current sewer rate.
         (b)   If the water was lost to a known cause and did not enter the
sewer system, add the amount obtained in division (D)(2)(a) of this section to
the applicable minimum charge. This is the amount of the adjusted bill for
sewer.
         (c)   If the water was lost to a known cause and did enter the sewer
system, or the water was lost to an unknown cause, subtract the gallons
obtained from division (D)(2)(a) of this section from the actual usage of the
period in question. Multiply the difference by the volume rate charged to the
Town by Moore County for wastewater treatment. Add this amount and the amount
obtained in division (D)(2)(a) of this section to the applicable minimum
charge. This is the amount of the adjusted bill for sewer.
      (3)   The timing of the water loss discovery may cover 2 billing periods,
therefore, an adjustment may be made for 2 consecutive billing periods.
      (4)   Only 1 adjustment for an account shall be made during any fiscal
year, however, if a second water loss occurs during the same fiscal year for an
account that has received an adjustment, and the amount of water lost is
greater than the loss which has already been adjusted, the customer may repay
the previously adjusted bill in full and receive an adjustment for the larger
water loss.
      (5)   The Town official in charge of utility billing may adjust sewer use
charges for residential swimming pools when a pool is initially constructed and
filled for the first time. In cases when a liner is replaced and the water from
the drainage does not enter the Town sewer system, an adjustment may be
allowed. Proof must be provided to receive adjustment for either situation.

hours to the premises of the consumer for the purpose of installing or removing
Town property, inspecting piping, reading or testing meters or for any other
purpose in connection with the Town service and facilities.
   (B)   Each consumer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be granted or

empowered to declare a state of voluntary conservation and to call upon all
water customers to employ voluntary water conservation measures.
   (D)   Declaration of mandatory conservation measures. Whenever the Manager
finds that there is the potential for a water emergency situation to occur or
exist, the Manager may declare a state of mandatory conservation. Under a state
of mandatory conservation, the Manager shall continue to encourage voluntary
water conservation measures, and he or she shall impose a scheduled water use
program or an outright ban on all Class 3 uses until the mandatory conservation
period is declared to be over by the Manager.
   (E)   Declaration of water shortage emergency measures. Whenever the Manager
finds that a water emergency situation exists, the Manager is empowered to
declare that a water shortage emergency exists. During a water shortage
emergency, Class 1 essential water uses shall be specifically identified as
targets for voluntary conservation measures. Class 2 socially or economically
important uses may be restricted or banned, and Class 3 nonessential uses shall
be restricted or banned. These restrictions or bans shall continue until the
water shortage emergency is declared ended by the Manager.
   (F)   Declaration of rationing. Whenever the Manager has declared a water
shortage emergency and finds a need to provide for the equitable distribution

      (2)   Further, due to situations brought on by drought or other special
infrastructure needs associated with a water emergency, the Town Council may
decide to adopt special rates that will reflect the additional costs associated
with treatment and distribution of water.
   (H)   Town policy. The Manager is hereby authorized to prepare a Town policy
to implement these water conservation measures to further define and give
examples of the various classes of water use, to prepare a mandatory water
rationing policy and plan, and to provide other conditions and provisions as
may be necessary to successfully carry out the goals of this section.

§ 50.019 PENALTY.
   Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, any person who violates any
provision of this chapter may receive a civil penalty of up to $500 per
violation per day for so long as the violation exists. Each day on which a
violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate and distinct
violation.
   (A)   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the Town Engineer or
his/her designee shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including,
but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude
and duration of the violation, efforts to correct the violation, the compliance
history of the person against whom the violation is assessed, the cost of
enforcement to the Town, whether the violation was willful or intentional and
any other factor as justice requires.
   (B)   The Town Engineer or his/her designee shall serve a written citation
on the violator, and the customer, if different, by personal delivery or by

§ 50.039 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL (BACKFLOW PREVENTION).
   (A)   Purpose and scope.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to define the authority of the Town
as having jurisdiction to ensure the safety of the water supply by eliminating
unprotected cross connections to the Town's potable water supply.
      (2)   This section shall apply to all users connected to the Town's
public potable water supply regardless of whether or not the user is located
within the Town limits.
      (3) All users connected to the Town's water supply shall comply with the
latest editions of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (P.L. 93-523), the North
-Carolina State Administrative Code (Title 15A, Subchapter l 8C), North
Carolina Plumbing Code, and the North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II)
as they pertain to cross connections with the public water supply.
   (B)   Definitions. For purposes of this section the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      AIR-GAP SEPARATION. A physical separation between the free-flowing
discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure
receiving vessel. An APPROVED AIR-GAP SEPARATION shall be at least double the
diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically above the overflow rim of the
receiving vessel-in no case less than 1 inch (2.54 cm).
      APPROVED. In reference to a water supply, shall mean a water supply that
has been approved by the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health and
Natural Resources (Division of Health Services). In reference to air-gap
separation, a pressure vacuum breaker, a double check valve assembly, a double
check detector assembly, a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly, a reduced pressure principle detector assembly, or other backflow
prevention assemblies or methods, shall mean an approval by the Town's Cross-
connection Coordinator.
      APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly used for containment
or isolation purposes that has been shown to meet design and performance
standards of the American Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE), the American
Water Works Association (AWWA), and the Foundation for Cross Connection Control
and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California.
      APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE. A device used for isolation purposes
that has been shown to meet the design and performance standards of the
American Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) and the American Water Works
Association (A WWA).
      APPROVED CHECK VALVE. A check valve that is drip-tight in the normal
direction of flow, when the inlet pressure is at least 1.0 psi and the outlet
pressure is 0. The check valve shall permit no leakage in a direction reversed
to the normal flow. The closure element ( e.g., clapper, poppet, or other
design) shall be internally loaded to promote rapid and positive closure. An
APPROVED CHECK VALVE is only one component of an approved backflow prevention
assembly i.e., pressure vacuum breaker, double check valve assembly, double
check detector assembly, reduced pressure principle assembly, or reduced
pressure detector assembly.
      APPROVED WATER SUPPLY. Any public potable water supply that has been
investigated and approved by the North Carolina Department of Environment,
Health, and Natural Resources. The system must be operating under a valid
health permit. In determining what constitutes an APPROVED WATER SUPPLY, the
North Carolina Division of Health Services has reserved the final judgment as
to its safety and potability.
      ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER or NON-PRESSURE-TYPE VACUUM BREAKER. A device
containing a float-check, a check seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of
water into the body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow
of water stops, the float falls and forms a check valve against back-siphonage,
and at the same time opens the air inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy
the vacuum. A shut-off valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of
the device. An ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER is designed to protect against a non-
health hazard (isolation protection only) under a back-siphonage condition
only.
      AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the Town's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary
waters may include water from another public potable water supply or any
natural source, such as a well, spring, river, stream, and the like, "used
water", or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted, contaminated or
objectionable, and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the Town
does not have sanitary control.
      BACKFLOW. The undesirable reversal of flow of water, or mixtures of water
and other liquids, gasses, or other substances, into the distribution pipes of
the consumer or public potable water system from any source or sources.
      BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly used to prevent backflow into
the consumer's water system or the public potable water  system. The type of
assembly used should be based on the degree of hazard, either existing or
potential (as defined herein). The types are:
         (a)   Double check valve assembly;
         (b)   Double check detector assembly (fire system);
         (c)   Pressure vacuum breaker;
         (d)   Reduced pressure principle assembly; and
         (e)   Reduced pressure principle detector assembly (fire system).
      BACK-PRESSURE BACKFLOW. Any elevation in the consumer water system (by
pump, elevation of piping, or steam and/or air pressure) above the supply
pressure at the point of delivery, which would cause, or tend to cause, a
reversal of the normal direction of flow.
      BACK-SIPHONAGE BACKFLOW. A reversal of the normal direction of flow in
the pipeline, due to a negative pressure (vacuum) being created in the supply
line, with the backflow source subject to atmospheric pressure.
      CERTIFIED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY TESTER. A person who is certified
to make competent tests, repairs, and reports on backflow prevention
assemblies. The tester shall be knowledgeable of applicable law, rules and
regulations, and must hold a current certificate from a state-approved training
program in the testing and repair of backflow prevention assemblies.

potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system, but that would
not constitute a health or a system hazard,
as defined herein. The maximum degree or intensity of pollution to which the
potable water system could be graded under this definition would cause a
nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable, or could cause minor damage to the
system or its appurtenances.
      POTABLE WATER. Water from any source, which has been investigated by the
North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources
(Division of Health Services), and has been approved for human consumption.
      PRESSURE VACUUM BREAKER. An assembly containing an independently
operating, internally loaded check valve, and an independently operating,
loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The
assembly is to be equipped with properly located test cocks and tightly closing
shut-off valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed
to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant) under a back-siphonage
condition only.
      PUBLIC POTABLE WATER SYSTEM. Any publicly or privately owned water
system, operated as a public utility, under a current North Carolina Department
of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources permit, to supply water for
public consumption or use. This system will include all sources, facilities,
and appurtenances between the source and the point of delivery, such as valves,
pumps, pipe, conduits, tanks, receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and
appurtenances used to produce, convey, treat, or store potable water for public

   COMMERCIAL HANDBILL. Any printed or written matter, sample or device,

      (1)   Advertises for sale any merchandise, product, commodity, or thing;
      (2)   Directs attention to any business, mercantile, commercial
establishment, or other activity, for the purpose of either directly or
indirectly promoting the interests thereof by sale;
      (3)   Directs attention to or advertises any meeting, theatrical
performance, exhibition, or event of any kind for which an admission fee is
charged for the purpose of private gain or profit, but shall not apply where an
admission fee is charged or a collection is taken up for the purpose of
defraying the expenses incident to the meeting, theatrical performance,
exhibition, or event of any kind, when either the same is held, given, or taken
place in connection with the dissemination of information which is not
restricted under the ordinary rules of decency, good morals, public peace,
safety, and good order. However, nothing contained in this division (3) shall
be deemed to authorize the holding, giving, or taking place of any meeting,
theatrical performance, exhibition, or event of any kind without a license,
where the license is or may be required by any law of the state or under any
ordinance of the Town of Southern Pines; or

in accordance with a federal statute or regulation, and any newspaper filed and

   NUISANCE.  
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, anything which is injurious to
health, is indecent or offensive to the senses, or is an obstruction to the
free use of property so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life
and property, or which unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the
customary manner, of any public park, square, street, or highway within the
Town. (In determining what constitutes a NUISANCE, for the purposes of this
chapter, the question is whether the nuisance will or does produce a condition
of things as in the judgment of reasonable persons is naturally productive of
actual physical discomfort to persons of ordinary sensibility and ordinary
tastes and habits. However, distinction should be made between public, private,
and mixed nuisances. For that purpose, a PUBLIC NUISANCE is one which affects
an indefinite number of persons, all the residents of a particular locality, or
all people coming within the extent of its range or operation, although the
extent of the annoyance or damage inflicted upon individuals may be unequal. A
PRIVATE NUISANCE includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the
property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful
use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the
enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury
different from that sustained by the general public. A MIXED NUISANCE has been
defined as one which is both public and private in its effects; public because
it injures many persons or all the community, and private in that it also
produces special injuries to private rights).
      (2)   ABATEMENT OF A NUISANCE. The removal, prostration, or destruction
of that which causes a nuisance, whether by breaking or pulling it down, or
otherwise removing, disintegrating, or effacing it.
   PARK. A park, reservation, playground, recreation center, or any other
public area in the Town owned or used by the Town and devoted to active or
passive recreation.
   PRIVATE PREMISES. Any dwelling, house, building, or other structure designed
or used either wholly or in part for private residential purposes, whether
inhabited or temporarily or continuously uninhabited or vacant, and shall
include any yard, grounds, walk, driveway, porch, steps, vestibule, or mailbox
belonging or appurtenant to the dwelling, house, building, or other structure.
   PUBLIC PLACE. Any and all streets, sidewalks, boulevards, alleys, or other
public ways and any and all public parks, squares, spaces, grounds, and
buildings.
   REFUSE. Any putrescible and nonputrescible solid wastes (except body wastes)
including garbage, rubbish, ashes, street cleanings, dead animals, abandoned
automobiles, and solid market and industrial wastes.
   RUBBISH. Nonputrescible solid waste consisting of both combustible and
noncombustible wastes, such as paper, wrappings, cigarettes, cardboard, tin
cans, yard clippings, leaves, wood, glass, bedding, crockery, and similar
materials.
   VEHICLE. Every device in, upon, or by which any person or property is, or
may be transported or drawn upon a highway, alley, or street, including devices
used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks. (MOTOR VEHICLE and ABANDONED
MOTOR VEHICLE are as they are defined in G.S. § 160A-303, which will be later
referred to in this chapter).

more than 30 days after the delivery or mailing of the notice. The owner or any
party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the notice, appear

notice. Any persons desiring to do so may attend the hearing and give evidence
relevant to the matter heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law
or equity shall not be controlling in the hearings.

§ 90.018 ISSUANCE OF ORDER TO ABATE.
   If a determination is made that the conditions constituting a public

of land. It shall be the duty of the Finance Department to mail a statement of
the charges to the owner or other person in possession of the premises, with
instructions that the charges are due and payable within 30 days from the
receipt thereof.
   (B)   In the event charges for the removal or abatement of a public nuisance
are not paid within 30 days after the receipt of a statement of charges as
provided in §
90.018, the charges shall become a lien upon the land or premises where the
public nuisance existed and shall be collected as unpaid taxes as provided in

(1989 Code, § 90.15) (Ord. passed 12-14-1982)
§ 90.021 OTHER REMEDIES.

§ 101.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the planting, maintenance,
and removal of trees on Town-owned public property and rights-of-way within the
Town and on Town-owned property wherever located. In order to protect and
conserve trees on public property and rights-of-way, this chapter provides for
the planting, pruning, treatment, and removal of trees and shrubs as is deemed
necessary. This chapter is also intended to provide for the trimming or removal
of trees on public land when they obscure street lights, interfere with utility
lines, constitute a hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic, or otherwise
endanger the public health, safety, or welfare, and to establish procedures and
practices for fulfilling these purposes.
   (B)   Another purpose of this chapter is to encourage, insofar as practical,
the protection and preservation of trees within the Town because of the unique
benefits they provide the community in assisting the natural control of solar
heat, soil conservation, flood control, air pollution, and noise; and in
providing a haven for community wildlife and providing citizens with
psychological relief from the increasing complexities of a manmade urban
environment.
   (C)   This chapter is intended to regulate and not to cause hardship to any
person who uses the utmost care and diligence to protect trees on Town-owned
property nor to preempt required corrective actions by persons, firms, or
corporations in clearly obvious emergency situations.

or inspections or tests to be made by approved and recognized inspection
organizations. However, no approval shall be based on reports of the
organizations unless the reports are in writing and certified by a responsible
officer of the organization.

to erect any building or structure on the line of any street, alley, or other
public place, or on the line of any adjoining private property, he or she shall
secure a survey of the line adjacent to the property on which the building or
structure is to be erected before proceeding with construction of the building
or structure. It shall be the duty of the Inspection Division to determine that

theretofore supplied, they shall be discontinued at the direction of the Chief
Inspector or his or her duly authorized agent.
   (D)   Certificates of occupancy. At the conclusion of all work done under a

adopted herein, or the zoning ordinance of the Town, and with the terms of the

being demolished, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in a
hazardous manner, or in substantial violation of any provision, standard, or
other requirement of this chapter or the regulatory codes adopted herein, or in
a manner that endangers life or property, the Building Inspector may order the

§ 151.45 REMEDIES.
   (A)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any structure, deteriorated
dwelling or dwelling unit fails to comply with an ordinance or order of the
Inspector to repair, alter, or improve it within the time specified therein, or
if the owner of a structure or dilapidated dwelling fails to comply with an
order of the Inspector to vacate and close, and remove or demolish it within
the time specified therein, the Inspector shall submit to the Town Council at
its next regular meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to petition
the Superior Court for an order directing the owner to comply with the order of
the Inspector, as authorized by North Carolina General Statutes.
   (B)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated dwelling or
dwelling unit, or of a structure or dilapidated dwelling, to comply with an
ordinance or order of the Inspector within the time specified therein, if
injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in
division (A) above, the Inspector shall submit to the Town Council an ordinance
ordering the Inspector to cause the structure, dwelling or dwelling unit to be
repaired, altered, improved, or vacated and closed and removed or demolished,
as demolition, and to placard the structure or dwelling as provided by state
law and §
151.44.
   (C)   Repair; vacation.
      (1)   If the Town Council adopts an ordinance or the Inspector issues an
order, ordering a dwelling or structure to be repaired or vacated and closed,
and if the owner has vacated and closed the dwelling and kept the dwelling
vacated and closed for a period of 1 year pursuant to the ordinance or order,
then if the Town Council shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and
purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling or structure in order to
render it fit and that the continuation of the dwelling or structure in its
vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety morals and
welfare of the Town in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would
create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants,
would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause to contribute
to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, and, in the
case of a dwelling would render unavailable property which might otherwise have
been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable
housing in this state, then in the circumstances the Town Council may, after
the expiration of a 1 year period, enact an ordinance and serve the ordinance
on the owner setting forth the following:
         (a)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days; or
         (b)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceed 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
      (2)   This ordinance shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of
Deeds in the county wherein the property of properties are located and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner
fails to comply with this ordinance, the public officer shall effectuate the
purpose of the ordinance.
   (D)   Alternative remedies. Neither this chapter or any of its provisions
shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the Town to
define and declare nuisances and to cause their abatement by summary action or
otherwise, or to enforce this chapter by criminal process as authorized by G.S.
§ 14-4 and §
151.50. The enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the
enforcement of any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in other
ordinances or laws.

the Inspector certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with
him, or her that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of

would cause imminent peril of life or property. If this is the case, the
requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order which may be
granted for due cause shown on not less than 1 day's written notice to the
Inspector by the Board, or by a court of record on petition made pursuant to
state law and §
151.47.

shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within
a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The
Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or
order appealed from, and may make the decision and order as in its opinion
ought to be made in the matter. To that end it shall have all the powers of the
Inspector, but the concurring vote of 4 members of the Board shall be necessary
to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Inspector. The Board shall
have power also in passing on appeals in any case where the strict letter of
the ordinance has been carried out but where there is a need, to adapt the
application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the
spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured,
and substantial justice done.
   (D)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by proceedings
in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the
Board, but not otherwise.
   (E)   All appeals which may be taken from decisions or orders of the
Inspector pursuant to this section shall be heard and determined by the Zoning
Board of Adjustment. As the body appeals, the Board shall have the power to fix
the times and places of its meetings, to adopt necessary rules of procedure and
any other rules and regulations which may be necessary for the proper discharge
of its duties. The Board shall perform the duties prescribed by this section
and shall keep an accurate journal of all of its proceedings.

§ 151.47 PETITION BY OWNER TO SUPERIOR COURT.
   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Inspector or a decision
rendered by the Board shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of
the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the Superior Court for a
temporary injunction restraining the Inspector pending a final disposition of
the cause, as provided by North Carolina General Statutes.

constitute a misdemeanor.
   (B)   Each ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the Register of
Deeds in the county wherein the property is located, and shall be indexed in
the name of the property owner in the grantor index, as provided by state law.
   (C)   As provided by North Carolina General Statutes, the amount of the cost
of any repairs, alterations, improvements, vacating and closing, or removal or
demolition, caused to be made or done by the Inspector pursuant to division (A)
above shall be a lien against the real property on which the cost was incurred.

remove or demolish it, on order of the Inspector duly made and served as herein

to §
151.43 and §§
151.45 through
151.47, to occupy or permit the occupancy of it after the time prescribed in
the order for its repair, alteration, or improvement or its vacation and

§ 154.05 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR LAND-DISTURBING ACTIVITY.
   No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be
undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards:
   (A)   Buffer zone. No land-disturbing activity during periods of
construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake
or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the
watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25% of
the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity.
      (1)   Projects on, over or under water. This subdivision shall not apply
to land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities
to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural water course.
      (2)   Buffer measurement. Unless otherwise provided, the width of a
buffer zone is measured horizontally from the edge of the water to the nearest
edge of the disturbed area, with the 25% of the strip nearer the land-
disturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of confining visible
siltation.
   (B)   Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall
be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other
adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left
exposed will, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, be
planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent ground cover,
devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. The angle for graded
slopes and fills must be demonstrated to be stable. Stable is the condition
where the soil remains in its original configuration, with or without
mechanical constraints.
   (C)   Fill material. Materials being used as fill shall be consistent with
those described in 15A NCAC 13B.0562 unless the site is permitted by the
Department’s Division of Waste Management to operate as a landfill. Not all
materials described in 15A NCAC 13B.0562 may be suitable to meet geotechnical
considerations of the fill activity and should be evaluated accordingly.
   (D)   Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a
tract, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install erosion
and sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain
the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of
the tract during construction upon and development of said tract, and shall
plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain
erosion after completion of construction or development. Except as provided in
§
154.05(B) above and §
154.09(B)(5), provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must
be accomplished within 90 calendar days following completion of construction or
development.
   (E)   Prior plan approval.
      (1)   No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if
more than one acre is to be uncovered unless, 30 or more days prior to
initiating the activity, a plan for the activity is filed with and approved by
the Town.
      (2)   The Town shall forward to the Director of the Division of Water
Resources a copy of each plan for land disturbing activity that involves the
utilization of ditches for the purpose of de-watering or lowering the water
table of the tract.
   (F)   Minimum requirements for tracts less than 1 acre. For residential and
commercial construction projects on sites or tracts that disturb less than 1
acre in surface area, the Town requires that the minimum erosion control
measures, as outlined in this section unless otherwise approved.
      (1)   The minimum required erosion control practices and measures to be
placed on an individual residential or commercial construction site that is
less than 1 acre in surface area are:
         (a)   Shall follow the mandatory standards §
154.05 divisions (A) through (D);
         (b)   Silt fencing shall be installed on all lower elevation
perimeters;
         (c)   A construction entrance shall be installed; and
         (d)   Seeding and/or ground stabilization.
      (2)   The site must comply with this chapter by installing and
maintaining all required controls measures. The only land disturbing activity
to take place before the erosion control measures are completed is the removal
of trees necessary to install the erosion control measures.
      (3)   If it is determined that a significant risk of accelerated erosion
or off-site sedimentation may occur as a result of the land-disturbing
activity, the Town may require the preparation and approval of a plan and that
a grading permit be secured for land-disturbing activity of areas less than 1
acre.
      (4)   Inspection procedure. The Building Inspector shall notify the
Erosion Control Inspector of the scheduled footing inspection at the site. If
the erosion control measures are not installed by the scheduled footing
inspection, the deadline for placement of these minimum erosion control
measures shall be the date at which the Building Inspector returns for the
foundation inspection. If, at the time of the foundation inspection or any
subsequent inspection, the Erosion Control Inspector observes any erosion
control problems on the site including failure to install erosion control
measures, a written notice of violation will be issued in accordance with §
154.17(C). The foundation inspection or any subsequent inspection approval will
not be rendered until all control measures are in place and functioning.
      (5)   Final inspections. When all construction on the project is
complete, the Erosion Control Inspector will evaluate the site and all
permanent erosion control features and off-site impacts to other properties. If
found to be in compliance, the Building Inspector will be advised, giving
approval for the certificate of occupancy.

lines for the provision of water, sewer, gas, telecommunications, or electrical
service, the draft erosion and sedimentation control plan may be submitted
without the written consent of the owner of the land, so long as the owner of
the land has been provided prior notice of the project.
   (D)   Plan review processing fee. A non-refundable plan review processing
fee, based on the number of acres or any part thereof, of land to be disturbed,
including off-site borrow and waste areas, and set in accordance with the
Town's fee schedule, is required to be paid at the same time as a soil erosion
and sedimentation control plan is initially submitted for review and approval.
Each plan shall be deemed incomplete until the plan review processing fee is
paid.
   (E)   Environmental policy act document. Any plan submitted for a land
disturbing activity for which an environmental document is required by the
North Carolina Environmental Policy Act (G.S. § 113A-1, et seq.) shall be

15 days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting the plan that it
has been approved, approved with modifications, or disapproved. Failure to
approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within 15
days of receipt shall be deemed approval.
   (H)   Approval. The Town shall only approve a plan upon determining that it
complies with all applicable state and local regulations for erosion and
sedimentation control. Approval assumes the applicant's compliance with the
federal and state water quality laws, regulations and rules. The Town shall
condition approval of plans upon the applicant's compliance with the federal
and state water quality laws, regulations and rules. The Town may establish an
expiration date, not to exceed 3 years for plan approved under this chapter
whereby no land-disturbing activity has been undertaken.
   (I)   Disapproval for content. The Town may disapprove a plan or draft plan
based on its content. A disapproval based upon a plan's content must
specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval.
   (J)   Other disapprovals.
      (1)   The Town shall disapprove an erosion and sedimentation control plan
if implementation of the plan would result in a violation of the rules adopted
by the Environmental Management Commission to protect riparian buffers along
surface waters. The Town may disapprove an erosion and sedimentation control
plan or disapprove a transfer of a plan under division (K) of this section upon
finding that an applicant or a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the
applicant:
         (a)   Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without
an approved plan, or has received notice of violation of a plan previously
approved by the Commission or a local government pursuant to the Act and has

(2). In addition, weekly and rain-event self-inspections are required by
federal regulations, that are implemented through the NPDES Construction
General Permit NO. NCG 0100000. The person who performs the inspection shall
maintain and make available a record of the inspection at the site of the land
disturbing activity. The record shall set out any significant deviation from
the approved erosion control plan, identify any measures that may be required
to correct deviation, and document the completion of those measurements. The
record shall be maintained until permanent ground cover has been established as
required by the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. The
inspections required by this section shall be in addition to the inspections
required by G.S. § 113A-61.1.
      (2)   Where inspections are required by §

of this section, a "significant deviation" means an omission, alternation, or
relocation of an erosion or sedimentation control measure that prevents it from
performing as intended. The record shall include measures required to correct
the significant deviation, along with documentation of when those measures were
taken. Deviations from the approved plan may also be recommended to enhance the
intended performance of the sedimentation and erosion control measures.
      (3)   Except as may be required under federal law, rule or regulation, no
periodic self-inspections or rain gauge installation is required on individual
residential lots where less than 1 acre is being disturbed on each lot.

§ 154.07 BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES.
   An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved if the plan
fails to address the following control objectives:
   (A)   Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe
erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from
erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special
attention.
   (B)   Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activity are to be planned
and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest time specified in G.S. § 113A-
57, the rules of this chapter, or as directed by the approving authority.
   (C)   Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and
conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time.
   (D)   Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of
exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during
the period of exposure.
   (E)   Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted to prevent off-site sedimentation damage.
   (F)   Manage storm water runoff. Plans shall be designed so that any
increase in velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from land-disturbing
activity will not result in accelerated erosion of the receiving stormwater
conveyance or at the point of discharge. Plans shall include measures to
prevent accelerated erosion within the project boundary and at the point of
discharge.
(1989 Code, § 154.08) (Ord. 1185, passed 6-14-2005; Am. Ord. 3032, passed 3-12-
2024)
§ 154.08 DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Except as provided for in §
154.08(B)(2), erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and
devices shall be so planned, designed, and constructed to provide protection
from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the 10-year storm. Runoff
rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the latest edition of the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation
Service’s “National Engineering Field Handbook”, or other acceptable
calculation procedures.
   (B)   In High-Quality Water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall
apply:
      (1)   Limit on uncovered areas. Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be
limited at any time to a maximum total area of 20 acres within the boundaries
of the tract. Only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW
zone shall be governed by this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within
the boundaries of the tract, with the written approval of the Town Engineer
upon providing engineering justification with a construction sequence that
considered phasing, limiting exposure, weekly submitted self-inspection
reports, and a more conservative design than the 25-year storm.
      (2)   Maximum peak rate of runoff protection.  Erosion and sedimentation
control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be planned,
designed and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year
storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to
procedures in the latest edition of the United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation of Service’s “National Engineering Field
Handbook” or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state
or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.
      (3)   Sediment basin design.
         (a)   Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and
constructed according to the following criteria:
            1.   Use a surface withdrawal mechanism, except when the basin
drainage area is less than 1.0 acre.
            2.   Have a minimum of 1800 cubic feet of storage area per acre of
disturbed area;
            3.   Have a minimum surface area of 325 square feet per cfs of the
25-year storm (Q25) peak flow;
            4.   Have a minimum dewatering time of 48 hours;
            5.   Incorporate 3 baffles, unless the basin is less than 20 feet
in length, in which case 2 baffles shall be sufficient.
         (b)   Upon a written request of the applicant, the Director may allow
alternative design and control measures in lieu of meeting the conditions
required in divisions (B)(3)(a)3. through (B)(3)(a)5. above if the applicant
demonstrates that meeting all of those conditions will result in design or
operational hardships and that the alternative measures will provide an equal
or more effective level of erosion and sediment control on the site.
Alternative measures may include quicker application of ground cover, use of
sediment flocculants, and use of enhanced ground cover practices.
      (4)   Grade. Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be
designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than 2 horizontal to 1
vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions
permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical
devices, structural devices or other forms of ditch liners proven as being
effective in restraining accelerated erosion. In any event, the angle for side
slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.
(1989 Code, § 154.09) (Ord. 1185, passed 6-14-2005; Am. Ord. 3032, passed 3-12-
2024)
§ 154.09 STORM WATER OUTLET PROTECTION.
   (A)   Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land disturbing
activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion
caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land disturbing activity.
   (B)   Performance standard. Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity
so that the post-construction velocity of the 10-year storm runoff in the
receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:
      (1)   The velocity established by the table in division (E) below, of
this section; or
      (2)   The velocity of the 10-year storm runoff in the receiving
watercourse prior to development.
         (a)   If conditions (B)(1) or (2) above of this section cannot be met,
then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be
designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the
velocity exceeds the "prior to development" velocity by 10%.
   (C)   Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in
combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are
no objectionable secondary consequences. The Town recognizes that the
management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and
bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will
be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce
successful results. Some alternatives, while not exhaustive, are to:
      (1)   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including
measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas
rendered impervious;
      (2)   Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using
vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in place of closed drains and high
velocity paved sections;
      (3)   Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities
to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge.
      (4)   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving
cross-sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining; and
      (5)   Upgrade or replace the receiving device, structure, or watercourse
such that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer
subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity.
   (D)   Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated to
the Town that storm water discharge velocities will not create an erosion
problem in the receiving watercourse.
   (E)   Table. The following is a table for maximum permissible velocity for
storm water discharges in feet per second (FPS) and meters per second (MPS).

§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   Civil penalties. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this
chapter, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or who
initiates or continues a land disturbing activity for which a plan is required,
except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved
plan, is subject to a civil penalty.
   (A)   Civil penalties for a violation. The maximum civil penalty amount that
the Town may assess per violation is $5,000. A civil penalty may be assessed
from the date of the violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall
constitute a separate violation. When the person has not been assessed any
civil penalty under this subsection for any previous violation, and that person
abated continuing environmental damage resulting from the violation within 180
days from the date of the notice of violation, the maximum cumulative total
civil penalty assessed under this section for all violations associated with
the land-disturbing activity for which the erosion and sedimentation control
plan is required is $25,000.
   (B)   Civil penalty assessment factors. The governing body of the Town shall
determine the amount of the civil penalty based upon the following factors:
      (1)   The degree and extent of harm caused by the violation;
      (2)   The cost of rectifying the damage;
      (3)   The amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance;
      (4)   Whether the violation was committed willfully; and
      (5)   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply
with this chapter.
   (C)   Notice of civil penalty assessment. The Town shall provide notice of
the civil penalty amount and basis for assessment to the person assessed. The
notice of assessment shall be served by any means authorized under G.S. § 1A-1,
Rule 4. A notice of assessment by the Town shall direct the violator to either
pay the assessment, contest the assessment within 30 days by filing a petition
for hearing with the Town Board of Adjustment as described in the Town of
Southern Pines Unified Development Ordinance § 2.23 Appeals: or file a request
with the Town for remission of the assessment within 60 days of receipt of the
notice of assessment. A remission request must be accompanied by a waiver of
the right to a contested case hearing pursuant to G.S. Chapter 150B and a
stipulation of the facts on which the assessment was based.
   (D)   Appeal of final decision. Appeal of the final decision of the Board of
Adjustment of the Town shall be to the Superior Court of Moore County by
proceedings in the nature of certiorari. The petition for the writ of
certiorari must be filed with the Moore County Clerk of Court within 30 days
after a written copy of the decision has been mailed to the person assessed.
   (E)   Remission of civil penalties.
      (1)   A request for remission of a civil penalty imposed under G.S. §
113A-64 may be filed with the Board of Adjustment within 30 days of receipt of
the notice of assessment. A remission request must be accompanied by a waiver
of the right to a contested case hearing pursuant to G.S. Chapter 150B and a
stipulation of the facts on which the assessment was based. The following
factors shall be considered in determining whether a civil penalty remission
request will be approved:
         (a)   Whether one or more of the civil penalty assessment factors in
G.S. § 113A-64(a)(3) were wrongly applied to the detriment of the petitioner.
         (b)   Whether the petitioner promptly abated continuing environmental
damage resulting from the violation.
         (c)   Whether the violation was inadvertent or a result of an
accident.
         (d)   Whether the petitioner had been assessed civil penalties for any
previous violations.
         (e)   Whether payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment for
necessary remedial actions or would otherwise create a significant financial
hardship.
         (f)   The assessed property tax valuation of the petitioner's property
upon which the violation occurred, excluding the value of any structures
located on the property.
      (2)   The petitioner has the burden of providing information concerning
the financial impact of a civil penalty on the petitioner and the burden of
showing the petitioner's financial hardship.
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment may remit the entire amount of the penalty
only when the petitioner has not been assessed civil penalties for previous
violations and payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment for necessary
remedial actions.
   (F)   Collection. If payment is not received or equitable settlement reached
within 30 days after demand for payment is made, the matter shall be referred
to the Town Attorney for institution of a civil action in the name of the Town
in the appropriate division of the General Courts of Justice in Moore County
for recovery of the penalty. A civil action must be filed within 3 years of the
date the final decision was served on the violator.
   (G)   Credit of civil penalties. The clear proceeds of civil penalties
collected by the Town under this subsection shall be remitted to the Civil
Penalty and Forfeiture Fund in accordance with G.S. § 115C-457.2. Penalties
collected by the Town may be diminished only by the actual costs of collection.
The collection cost percentage to be used shall be established and approved by
the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management on an annual basis,
based upon the computation of actual collection costs by the Town for the prior
fiscal year.
   (H)   Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any
provision of this chapter, or rule or order adopted or issued by the Commission
or a local government, or who knowingly or willfully initiates or continues a
land-disturbing activity for which a plan is required except in accordance with
the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, shall be guilty of a
Class 2 misdemeanor which may include a fine not to exceed $5,000 as provided
in G.S. § 113A-64.
